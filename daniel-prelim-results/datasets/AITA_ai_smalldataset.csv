4czypu,"you're not the asshole. 

business is business, and if she can't keep her product consistent and/or her customers happy, maybe getting reported will be the kick in the butt she needs to get her crap together.

4czypu,"Not an asshole. You're right to take it to etsy while there's still time, she might be purposefully trying to stall you. ",Human
4czypu,That's what my gut is telling me. It isn't hard to look at a picture of a ripped sweatshirt and offer a refund/replacement.,Human
4czypu,"Not the asshole. As a seller, you have to know how to deal with this kind of situation before it even comes around. Part of the good thing about Etsy is the personal touch between vendor and buyer. This seller is stomping all over that spirit.

Not giving you a straight answer is a childish move. It also makes me wonder if she might have known about the hole and tried to sell it anyway.",Human

4czypu,The asshole is the one stalling the process to escape accountability,Human
4czypu,"This. Also the seller more or less straight lied to you, saying they would get back to you monday.",Human
4czypu,You're not the asshole at all. You made her aware there was a problem and she didn't fix it. That's exactly why Etsy has a process for this and you're completely justified in using it.,Human
4czypu,"In no way could I see you possibly being an asshole. 

As others had mentioned, business is business. She wasn't professional, responsible nor even handled the situation in a honest way. It could be that she is new to the whole thing about being a seller or that she was trying to get in touch with her source, but that should not be your problem nor an excuse to the way a customer should be treated. 

The only thing I would mention to help you or anyone who find themselves in a similar predicament in the near future; Once a seller seem to be unable to handle your request for a refund or replacement for poor quality/ damaged goods in a satisfactory manner, tell them that you will launch a report or infraction against them. That usually scares them to submission and even throw in some 'goodwill' gifts.",Human

Giving me very vague times of when it would be returned. But then the 3rd and 4 th day he was barely responding to my plethora of phone calls and texts. To the point of where he wouldn't respond at all or not tell me where he was or when he was bringing it back. So I reported it on the 3 rd day. He is also pissed that I was "" up his ass"" with calls and texts. Anyway in the end he's the asshole and I got my car back undamaged.",Human

4d4npn,How about sending yourself a reminder on tasker to text her every morning. Then send a real text not an automatic text. You get the automatic not her. If you do that then you are not the asshole.,Human
4d4npn,"I wouldn't say it's necessarily an asshole thing to do, but it's a bit dishonest. If I was the sort of girl who really liked getting good morning texts I would be happy specifically because my SO was thinking of me first thing in the morning and wanted to wish me well for the day. If he wasn't actually thinking of me in that moment I would feel kind of cheated. Your solution is fine if she never finds out about it, but I'd be willing to bet she would be hurt if she ever found out that you were doing it in such an impersonal way.  

Can you talk to her about your sleeping habits and arrange to just text her when you actually wake up? It's unreasonable of her to expect you to wake up unpleasantly early just to text her sweet nothings.  

Edit: regardless of your girlfriend, struggling with mornings is often an indication that you're not getting enough sleep or enough good quality sleep. You should read about sleep hygiene and see if there's anything you can change so that you can deal with mornings a bit better. Good luck!",Human
4d4npn,"She doesn't expect me to text her good morning at all, but she does like it. The ultimate goal is for me to get my sleeping habits under control, and then not need to have it text her automatically.

4d4npn,"That's a good idea. That's the end goal for me, to make it so I just need the prod to text her because I'll be waking up at decent hours. I like the idea.

I just had an idea; would setting it up to open up my SMS app as soon as I exit out of my alarm count as dishonest? What about if I included the pre-made messages, but didn't have it send automatically? ",Human
4d4npn,"You know your girlfriend better than we do. Ask yourself: if you would tell her, two weeks from now, ""those texts were a script because you like morning texts and I forget them"", how would you expect her to feel? Amused, thankful? Or insecure, disappointed, annoyed? If it's anything negative, then yeah, this is a bit of an asshole move.

I second the setting an alarm to remind yourself!",Human
4d4npn,You can type it in the box at night then hit send in the morning. ,Human
4d4npn,"You are definitely the asshole.  I understand you're on different schedules, so just don't text your girlfriend in the morning.  

She's going to find out, and you'll be in a world of hurt, rightfully so.

My ex worked 2nd shift, and I worked 8-5.  I never expected him to text me good morning.",Human

4d4npn,Case dismissed for lack of conflict or drama. ,Human

4d4npn,"For the sake of a judgement, I am going to say hesitantly that yes, you are being an asshole here.

Even if she demands for morning text, she wants it from you, not from some automated software. Sure, it might have been written sweetly and have different lines, but it is still dishonest and makes the whole point of greeting each other when you wake up kind of moot.

Get the tasker to prod you to send the actual text instead and tell her your sleeping habits in the case where you might not be able to send that text. As it is now, if she finds out about this, boy.. trouble awaits.",Human
4d4npn,As long as you aren't jerking off as the message is automatically sent I think you are not the asshole. ,Human
4d4npn,"It's a tough call.  Your intentions are good, but you're being dishonest in a way that might hurt her feelings if she discovered the truth.  My husband is a huge scatterbrain, too, and I can tell you from personal experience that one or two sincere texts from my man mean more because I know how he functions -- and they would mean a thousand times more to me than a daily text he auto-sent from a program.  Quality over quantity, man.  Not an asshole, but cut that tasker shit out.",Human
4d4npn,It's creepy to text someone good morning. ,Human

4d4npn,I think your intentions are good but this can only ultimately be seen as asshole behavior.  You are setting up a system to pretend to care enough to overcome your sleepy habits and send a text.  Read that again and explain to me how that's going to end well or be seen in a positive light by your GF. ,Human

4d4npn,"This one is sort of tough for me to judge. You're doing this to be sweet to her, but it is a sort of ""cheat"" that you're using. I don't think I can say with certainty that this is morally wrong and you're the asshole, because you have good intentions, and I firmly believe morality lies in our intent. However, I can see how your girlfriend could say you're the asshole if she were to find out.

I've been known to sleep until noon and sometimes I don't respond to my boyfriend's good morning text until even later if I have a busy day. I don't function well in the morning, so my boyfriend doesn't *expect* much from me in the morning. My unsolicited advice for you is to *talk* with your girlfriend about your inability to function in the morning and for you both to adjust your expectations of each other. She should be able to know you love her if the first time you text her in the day is evening. Good morning texts are nice, but they aren't necessary. ",Human
4d4npn,"It's clingy. It says, ""Hey, I don't date much, so I'm going to be overly-affectionate in hopes you'll find it endearing."" Protip: They won't. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'd say you're not at all the asshole. She likes getting a text in the morning, you're giving her that.",Human
4d4npn,Yea I understand good morning texts sometimes. I had the same thought. It seems clingy to do each day and more genuine to do when you actually wake up and think about sending one.,Human

Sounds like he came up with an asshole solution to a girlfriends insecurity problem. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'd advise you not to do it at all. Maybe if you're like, ""Good morning, want to go to breakfast?"" But don't send good-morning texts for the sake of texting. Texting is a crutch - use it sparingly. It shouldn't be used for conversations or used as a tool to convey affection. ",Human
4d4npn,Yea I agree with you. I guess you just conveyed the idea more correctly haha I was just saying every once in a blue moon it won't hurt and every morning is just weird ,Human

4d4npn,It's magnificent. So powerful. ,Human
4d4npn,"Ouch, I wasn't aware that I had to be 100% on top of adulting. Sorry I don't meet your standards, but believe it or not, most people aren't responsible adults. I'm trying though, and thought that automating the text might help keep up the illusion. ",Human

4d4npn,"It doesn't sound like she's demanding them, so I agree with everything else you said and am gonna go with yeah, OP is the asshole here, even though his intentions are good.

If my boyfriend did this and I found out, I would be really upset. Not just mad, but like seriously disappointed and worried about other aspects of our relationship that I thought were genuine but might just be being half-assed. OP, I'd stop now and set an alarm to remind you to text her instead. That's still personal and shows that you're making an effort. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'll second this opinion.

I'm a girl who would appreciate a good morning text if my boyfriend woke up after me (he doesn't) and it would be because he was thoughtful enough to send me the message. I don't care if his phone reminded him to do it, since it's his idea to set that up in the first place.",Human
4d4npn,"Contrary to many opinions here, I don't think you're an asshole at all. If it's really important for your girlfriend to get that good morning message but it's something that is hard for you to do because of sleep schedules/whatever, I think you're actually really thoughtful to always make sure she gets her good morning, even if you're not personally writing out the message every day. Everyone has different relationship ""needs"" and if this is a tiny thing that she needs, you are providing it. Personally I don't care about this sort of stuff and my boyfriend is not a morning person at all so I wouldn't expect it, your post makes you seem thoughtful and caring about your partner which is the most important part.",Human
4d4npn,"To me it sounds like a chore - and chores that can be automated should.

However, I will say that this is probably going to backfire the first time she texts something like ""OMG Snuffles died"" (or whatever, if she doesn't have a pet, then her grandma or something else terrible) and then a few hours later gets ""Good morning beautiful xoxoxoxo."" Just saying.",Human
4d4npn,"Everyone sucks. How does she feel if she doesn't get a good morning text from you? Is it really that important? You both should be confident enough in your relationship, that missing a good morning text or two isn't going to kill you. If you're going through those lengths just to keep her happy, then you guys have other issues. ",Human
4d4npn,"From OP:
&gt; She doesn't expect me to text her good morning at all, but she does like it.


&gt;I know that good-morning texts are something that she likes, and I want to fulfil that

Saying that she **demands** the texts and then that it appears there would be **major problems** if he skipped them is contrary to everything OP has said. He's is just trying to be a good boyfriend!",Human

There may be better ways to do this (like amy colorado said about setting a reminder) but this definitely isn't assholish at all, your intentions are good, and your methods are (IMO) reasonable.",Human
4d4npn,whats the point if its the same text every time anyway? its nice in the beginning but becomes a forced sacrifice sooner or later without any inherit value. why not not include some sort of information? for example take something interesting out of your dream and turn it into a sentence. it also wakes you up better if you use your brain.,Human

Is it ok if he looks over my shoulder?"" and when some patients said they'd rather have some privacy, I left the room without a comment.

Inappropriate jokes are obviously not okay, but to be honest, they're just part of the job. I don't think anyone in the medical field has managed to avoid them. I usually just ignore them. If they're particularly bad, I tell the patient to watch their language but I never get angry at them.",Human

This dentist is violating doctor-patient confidentiality.

The website of the American Dental Association says the following in their Ethics section:

&gt;If it is necessary for a treating dentist to consult with another dentist or physician with respect to the patient, and the circumstances do not permit the patient to remain anonymous, the treating dentist should seek the permission of the patient prior to the release of data from the patient's records to the consulting practitioner.

Personally I tip 20% most always and tip 15% when I get below par service  ",Human
4diwg3,No. Seems right to me. Just don't tip so much at places that already pay more than server wages: it's unnecessary and rude of them to put their beggar cup out.,Human
4diwg3,15% is standard. Anything more indicates exceptional service.,Human
4diwg3,"Nah, 20% is ""great job""",Human
4diwg3,No that's not being an asshole. 15-25% is the standard for tipping. It's on the low side but by no means a dick move. ,Human
4diwg3,"Unwritten rules just don't work that well. I hate everything that has to do with tipping. The business owners should pay more/charge more so I don't have to try to figure out who gets a 401K match after I finish my dinner. I'm not saying I don't tip, it's just a fucked up system

Edit to confirm you're not the asshole",Human
4diwg3,"Not an asshole. If you're ever really impressed with service, you should consider more than 15% though.

4diwg3,"Yeah, I have to come get it? Nah.",Human
4diwg3,"Not the asshole. I would tend to agree with your friends that something around 18% is sort of the new average (or maybe I just only hang out with overly generous people who knows) so you're definitely on the low end, but you're tipping an OK amount and that's not rude.",Human
4diwg3,You should tip for takeout.. Ever been a waiter? You tip out on sales percentage. And it sucks taking time from tables to get everything ready just to have less money because of it.. ,Human
4diwg3,"Once I had a group come in. They tipped 20$. It was nice, like a 25% tip. Next time, they came, I was excited especially because they went all out. 20$ still. Being like 10%.. x.x",Human
4diwg3,Its frustrating in other countries too. I usually ask the table next to me whats appropriate haha. ,Human
4diwg3,"I'm not sure how many people replying are Canadian. The 18 percent thing is a recent thing and is from the states, where they make something like a few bucks per hour wage (based on what I've seen on Reddit)

In Canada, as far as I'm aware, they still make minimum wage (plus the tips). 15 percent is completely fair",Human
4diwg3,I'm so glad I live in a country where tipping isn't a thing.,Human
4diwg3,"Canada here too, I always tip 10% and 15 if I feel like it. Wasn't it always 10%? When I moved to Alberta the default amount was 15 or 20 and I always put less because fuck that, greedy cunts. I never tip for takeout or at Chinese buffets because they don't do anything. ",Human
4diwg3,Why is the percentage going up??? Inflation causes the amount to go up anyways. I still only tip 10% and for bad service 5 cents on the table so they know I thought about the tip and didn't forget.,Human
4diwg3,That's my attitude to it as well. I'm not very needy so i tip based off of how much work I put the server through. I don't understand why I should pay more for the server to come by once and give me a steak and and beer while the table next to me over complicates a 5 dollar meal and has the server over every 5 minutes.,Human
4diwg3,Maybe my indifference is because I was a cook. ,Human
4diwg3,I can afford to have a car and an apartment thanks to getting tipped. I'm glad it is a thing here.,Human
4diwg3,"I couldn't tell you why, but I always tip 20% and sometimes more if service is great. If there's a problem I speak to a manager instead of leaving a crappy tip. Everyone I go out to eat with (including my parents) tips similarly to this.",Human

4diwg3,Yes. This ain't the 1950s,Human
4diwg3,Your grandma sounds like a cunt.,Human

4diwg3,"The only thing I'd suggest tipping more on is if you get pizza delivery, depending on how far you live. If you were to get $15 of pizza delivered but you live ten minutes from the store, we'd prefer it if you tipped us more since we had to drive so far. But if you live pretty close, then it's nbd.",Human
4diwg3,"Okay so then you're being an asshole, but at least you're doing it on purpose. And presumably for valid reasons. 10% is low, but if you're a low-maintenance customer, and consistent, the servers can give you basic service and work on impressing the person who might tip more. I started tipping higher when my little family started being more work for the busboy, because I know they get a share. Same for hotel maids, who are really on the low end of the totem pole. ",Human
4diwg3,"I'm Dane, we don't tip here. Ecxept for our fedoras",Human
4diwg3,"It's a vicious cycle. 15% of the pre-tax total used to be the norm. Now it's the minimum, and it's based on the post-tax total. Some restaurants even have a little table saying what the 15%, 18%, 20 and sometimes 25%. Often I find these amounts mathematically inflated. This means waiters now expect a minimum of 25% on the pre-tax total. Every time the average tip is considered the new minimum tip, the expectation keeps increasing. Of course this means that restaurants want to get their money's worth from someone earning so much. So they add on bussing, cleaning and prep to the expected tasks. 

Last week I went to a restaurant, was kept waiting 30 mins for a table, and the waited 45 mins for my food. After that I still tipped the waitress 30%, because I didn't want her to get screwed over for an hour of her evening wasted by a badly run kitchen. Does that even make sense? 

I am glad more restaurants are moving to self-service, or being tip included. Because I NEVER feel I have gotten my money's worth from a tip. It always feels like charity or a shakedown.",Human
4diwg3,"you're right about being low maintenance, i usually know what i want when i order my drink and then eat and leave, all they do is bring the food and drink to me and that's it. if i'm at a bar running a tab and they keep bringing drinks and making changes to stuff for my liking then that deserves a better tip. but just to bring my food to me and nothing else? 10%. ",Human
4diwg3,"""You were horrible"" is 0% for me.  I've only had to do it once.",Human
4diwg3,"0% for me is ""We're done here"" and usually involves the manager. One waitress had the audacity to give me five ones back with my change. I asked for a glass of water three times and I'm still waiting for it. No, You're not getting a tip. Get my order right and don't refill my drink once? You're horrible but we all have off days.",Human
4diwg3,"Yeah, when by the time you bail there are sticky handprints everywhere, and debris under the table, plus it all had to be boxed quickly so you could finish at home with a less-miserable toddler, or at least where their rage won't disturb others, and the server cut the register line to get you rung up, after doing their best to get you something acceptable to feed the starving beast, that's when you gratefully ladle bills onto the table. ",Human
4diwg3,"Not sure how this compares, but I'm on minimum wage ($16NZD) with no tipping and I get ~$450 a week. Now I don't know what the exchange rate is but I feel like I'm getting the better deal here.",Human
4diwg3,"Nope. For me it's ""Shitty"" = 0%. ""Okay"" = 5%. ""Good"" = 10%. ""Amazing"" = 15%. Not everyone can indulge their server with an 18-20% tip. And that's only at restaurants or hair appointments.",Human
4diwg3,Ime 20% is standard. And for bar tenders it's 25%. ,Human
4diwg3,"It depends on the price and type of service.  I generally tip 20%, with a minimum of $2. The percentage changes based on quality of service, overall price, and the assumed hourly pay of the person. ",Human
4diwg3,Well it depends on how many hours your are assigned for. I work 35 hours and get about 900€ + 300€ tipping,Human
4diwg3,"Nope. It's more than I tip.

If I pick food up, I don't tip. Cooks get a standard wage and there was no serving staff.

I will tip for a good haircut but I don't usually tip because they make decent money.

I usually tip as a whole at the bar and it's usually only a few dollars because I don't require a lot and so they don't give a lot.

Tipping 15% constantly isn't being an asshole. ",Human
4diwg3,that's their job though. I don't have kids either. i'm tipping them for the service not how well they do their job.,Human
4diwg3,"Depends on where you live. Where I am, it's not about percentages. It's almost always flat amounts.

$1.00 is ""average"", $2.00 is ""better,"" $3.00 is ""good,"" $5.00 is ""great."" More than $5.00 is ""I had a birthday party.""

Where I am, you don't ever go into work expecting someone to tip, because a lot of people don't. I live in the US.",Human

Fun fact: In the end we worked pretty good as a group und delivered a good presentation.

Best thing to do for you: Make yourself leader and make sure everybody knows their part. If they won´t work with you (especially the current leader) make sure you talk to your teacher. No need for you to get a bad grade or fail class because you have morons in your group.

Nothing in the post makes you an asshole (going off the information presented). ",Human

You could try taking your dad aside, (not literally, obviously) and telling him his hobby has become an obsession, and is hurting his wife. It just may be the wrong time to spring on a guy who's just been disabled, but both you and her have undealt with resentment built up. At least tell him to stop being a shit patient and do as he's told, because he's not the only one affected. Tell him to stop moaning about the bikes, before he loses his wife and house as well.",Human
4dp5aw,"Resentment is a great word, I wish I had thought of it. 

The problem is that we've tried to talk to him about this before. He just goes into denial, gets offended, and then insults my hobbies. I'm not a big enough of a person to agree for the sake of placidity and then we start fighting. I love him, but goddamn do I not like talking to him. 

I know I should try and make him be nicer to my mother and the nurses and shit. But in defense, he is in a lot of pain -out of the ICU this morning, and I'm just not sure that this is really my place to say anything. ",Human
4dp5aw,"Thanks, I've been feeling awful and It's nice to get some validation that I'm not a complete piece of shit. 

I'm more of a person that lives in denial and isolates myself to deal with it. I'm gonna have to learn to be better, I don't have a choice. I have to help him and I really can't let my anger and bitterness show. It'll just start more fights and I'm emotionally gone enough. ",Human
4dp5aw,"No, not an asshole. You're life has changed massively out of nowhere and it's not surprising that the stress is making you resentful.

I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be a psychologist but if your dad's obsession is at the point where it's actually affecting the house and his relationships then I think that he needs some real help. That's not me trying to diagnose anything, it just seems clear that he needs a professional because it sounds incredibly unhealthy.

However, even though this obsession has hurt people, I wouldn't say that he put himself in the position to get hurt like he did. It was a *drunk* driver. The guys who hit him fucked up bad, and it could have happened even if your dad was driving or walking. This event wasn't your dad's fault at all. His continued obsession over cycling, though, sounds like it could be an issue in the future.

So honestly I would try talking to a professional if you can. A pro can tell you if your dad's hobby is as destructive as it sounds and perhaps give you an idea of how to help. I know that in a lot of countries this sort of thing is expensive, but it's worth it if you think it'll lead to a healthier life for everyone.

It feels like what I'm doing isn't important or even considered because YOU texted and I'm supposed to stop everything. That is annoying and inconsiderate. Especially, when you feel like your gf is supposed to know you too. Like, I'm not a phone person so respect that, if that makes sense",Human

I have friends that complain that I don't always respond and try to guilt me for it.  But I often work 16 hour shifts and giving my thoughts on a sports game just doesn't figure into my day.  You have to see how much he cares about you through different means because you arent, and shouldn't be, the only thing that matters to him so to pick him apart for something so small is a bit too far. ",Human
4dqv6w,"No, you're not an asshole for communicating feelings and needs to your boyfriend. Communication is important in a relationship. If all you did was tell him that it bothers you and asked him to respond, you are not an asshole. If you demanded he respond and you text him a hundred times a day, that would be a different story.

While this can be a deal breaker for some, as another user mentioned, it doesn't have to be a deal breaker for everyone. It could be that you and your boyfriend are just not compatible; he may not be a phone person and you are. Or it could be that one or the other of you doesn't have a very strong opinion on phones, and responding to your messages may be something he's willing to compromise on. ",Human
4dqv6w,"No you're not an asshole for letting asking him to try to respond quickly to your texts. Just keep in mind that he probably won't be able to respond immediately everytime. I know that's hard on you because of your social anxiety, but its not always possible to respond immediately. Talk with him about what he considers to be a reasonable timeframe to get back to you. If he says he will get back to you with in an hour, than you can use that knowledge to help keep calm if he doesn't respond right away. Do you see someone for your social anxiety? If so see if they have suggestions for coping techniques for when he can't respond right away. 

It perfectly reasonable to ask that he respond in a timely manner most of the time, but if you expect immediate responses everytime it steps across the line.",Human
4dqv6w,"Short answer: definitely not an asshole.

Long answer: my boyfriend is the same way as yours and I'm the same way as you, and it's really frustrating when he doesn't reply to or acknowledge my messages. I communicated to him that I needed response and he's just really not the type to text back and forth all day. At first it was a little bit of a problem, but now it's actually really refreshing not to have to be checking my phone all the time. We see each other almost every day, so there's no reason for us to text all day and then just sit in silence when we see each other. We compromised that he would always respond when we were making plans and also when we would not be seeing each other that say. On days we don't see each other, we usually only talk in the evening/at night when both of us are done with school/work/etc. Maybe y'all can come up with a similar solution?",Human

4dqv6w,"You're not an asshole yet. But I've noticed that a lot of people who say stuff like ""please don't ignore messages"" usually have to say so because they text too often. Also, if you are not being considerate of the fact that his life does not, should not and will not revolve around you then you're the asshole. Don't demand his time, just let him know how you feel.  So no one's an asshole but keep in mind that you aren't entitled to anyone's time.",Human
4dqv6w,"I actually had the same problem as you with my boyfriend. We reached an agreement that he would text me when he knew he was going to be busy (""Hey I'm going longboarding and won't be on my phone!"") so I knew what he was up to and that he wouldn't be replying to me. That made it much easier for me to deal with. ",Human
4dqv6w,Yeah. Chill out.,Human
4dqv6w,"I feel like I communicated that I don't expect immediate responses and not even all the time. My issue is that often he just doesn't bother replying to things at all at any point and the next time we talk would often be hours or even a day later when I initiated conversation again. Also we don't see each other all that often in person. 

I myself don't respond right away and would hate to be expected to so I definitely didn't want him to feel like I wanted his immediate attention all the time. But generally I will always respond with something even if later and not outright ignore people because I don't want them to feel that way and I follow the same rule with him. Also he really is a phone person which is why it upset me. ",Human
4dqv6w,"Definitely not expecting immediate replies at all. Just some level of replying at some point is all I was after. He just has a habit of being on Facebook, seeing my message and never replying (which is why I hate the new Facebook stuff because I'd rather not know these things because then I'd assume he's busy rather than feeling outright ignored). Even if he's not in the mood to reply (and again that's absolutely fine with me) I would rather he didn't open it and replied later instead of opening and never replying if that makes sense. ",Human
4dqv6w,"As said earlier, not about immediate responses. More about not responding at all. I tried to communicate that to him because immediate responses is definitely an unreasonable request. ",Human
4dqv6w,"I totally get that. I have a friend who is on her phone 24/7, yet when I text her she often doesn't respond at all, even if it's something that really warrants a response. I'd tell her something important, then she doesn't text anything for two days and starts a different subject after that. If she was my SO, it would drive me crazy. That doesn't mean that what she's doing is objectively wrong, just that I can't deal with it.

If you tell him how much it bothers you, you give him the chance to adapt his behavior to your needs. You'd be an asshole if you left him in the dark and just became more and more frustrated over time. He will feel the frustration without having a chance to do anything about it if you don't tell him what's up.",Human
4dqv6w,"I'm that person, who sees a text and will just respond hours later. I just don't like texting, but I'll get around to it eventually.

They're not an asshole, they just screwed themselves by not confirming what you were willing to pay before doing the work.",Human
4dtnx6,"Good point. The answer might simply be that it's some rando off of Craigslist, haha.",Human
4dtnx6,"To be fair, that's the base price. They gave no indication of how much labor, etc. Would cost. Needles to say, a surprise $300 for a piece of wood is ridiculous. ",Human
4dtnx6,"See, that seems reasonable. I'm super confused as to how they think this business model is appropriate. All of the labor, with none of the profit, and customer dissatisfaction to boot.",Human
4dtnx6,"You are not the asshole, they are. Craigslist is a shady place full of shady people. Hope you didn't give them your address or anything.  ",Human
4dtnx6,Luckily no info was shared. ,Human
4dtnx6,Good job OP. ,Human
4dtnx6,"Honestly, it seems like they may have worded it vaguely so they could charge more and get away with it, since a lot of people won't stand up for themselves and will just pay what they ask for to avoid an awkward situation. ",Human
4dtnx6,"That's a great point. I don't accept no guff from no one, haha.",Human
4dtnx6,"&gt;Since I didn't sign a contract

You don't have to sign a contract to be liable, email text can act as a written contract in court (at least in the US).  But you put a stipulation of wanting to know the cost first, which they didn't comply do.  It's their mistake, I don't think you're an asshole for not paying.",Human
4dtnx6,"Over here it's customary for the seller to write up a quote beforehand. Isn't that how it's done where you live?

Basically it's the seller saying ""I will do it for this amount of money"" and then you sign a document agreeing to this. If the seller makes some bad estimates and it ends up costing a lot more than what he though it would, that's bad luck for him but the price remains the same.

This really is very basic business practice over here. If the seller wouldn't do this, he's pretty damn unprofessional.

So no, you're not an asshole for backing out, you both just don't really seem to know what you're doing. You live, you learn.",Human
4dtnx6,"If you verbatim asked for a **total** price, you're in the right.

If the seller is completely unable to estimate time range to be spent on something, they are a terrible seller.  Considering they are on Craigslist instead of a site with ratings like etsy, I'd wager they know they can't cut it.

Just to be safe, I'd back up all those text messages if I were you.",Human
4dtnx6,"Not the asshole, for a few reasons. 

1) They said: ""I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.""""

Fucking bullshit, they're a carpenter and they 'don't know' how much work it is to sand and finish a single piece of wood?  It's really fucking basic. I've done like, 2 woodworking projects ever and I could give you an accurate estimate for this.  It would take maybe 3 hours of actual work, tops.  

2) They didn't tell you the final price or even an estimate up front.  This is amateur at best, scammy at worst.  Either they were trying to rip you off, or you taught them a valuable lesson about how to deal with customer, i.e. get it in writing!  They are either stupid or severely dishonest, possibly both. ",Human
4dtnx6,"In order for there to be a legal contract, both parties have to have some understanding of what they are agreeing to.  In this case, that clearly didn't happen. ",Human
4dtnx6,My thoughts exactly. It seems ridiculous that they couldn't estimate the amount of work that needed to be done. ,Human
4dtnx6,Good point. I have all the messages on my phone. ,Human
4dtnx6,"It seems like he's the asshole. It seems like he didn't tell you that the extra glossing and such would cost extra money. Giving an estimate is part of doing contract work. Sure it should be understood that it is just an estimate, but if cost starts to look like it is going to far exceed the estimate then you contact the customer and verify that he is willing to pay for it. He should have made it clear that the glossing costs extra money. Otherwise it seems reasonable to assume that it is part of the service.

I used to have a mechanic who worked on my car. We did regular business. If I took my car into him for some work and it ended up that more and different work was needed than originally talked about he would call me to talk about it, how much it would cost, and if I was prepared to pay for it. He wouldn't just assume that I'm willing to pay an extra  $100 than what we had discussed. This is just good and proper business.

I have numeral examples like this throughout my life. Repair work for a watch. Contract work on a house. Etc. We always agree on a fairly accurate estimate before actual work on the final product is began.",Human
4dtnx6,"It is totally ridiculous.  If you can't even *guess* how long it takes to sand and finish 18 square feet of wood, you really have no business selling woodworking services. ",Human
4dtnx6,"Sure, it's an implicit contract to pay the amount discussed, which according to OP was $60-100.  You can't really claim there was a contract to pay some random amount that never came up in writing. ",Human
4dtnx6,"Yes, totally. And yeah, it would be shocking if this 'carpenter' tried to sue, even more so if they came away with a dime. ",Human
4dtnx6,"They literally made no mention of extra costs. They had the gall to blame me. They said it's currently $60, so in my mind I thought the price wouldn't deviate too far from that.",Human
4dtnx6,"Hahaha, right?",Human
4dtnx6,"For those interested, this is what they said at the end of the back and forth regarding price:

""If you don't ask, why would I expect there to be a problem. If a slab of wood is already at 60 you should expect the price to go up substantially. 60 is already a high price for a slab as the one I had. I put several hours into that so yea I I'm going to charge quite a bit. Its the buyers job to ask the questions. I told you it would all depend on how many hours I put into it. You had no follow up ? As to a ball park price. You went right into dimensions. I'm sorry you feel misled but that is not my fault you had no follow up questions for me. I've sold many of these and have never had a problem. Let's just let this be the end of this because I don't have time to go back and forth over this.""

What do you think? ",Human
4dtnx6,They should have given you some sort of indication of those costs though.,Human
4dtnx6,It should have been his job to disclose an estimate of the extra costs. He's completely unjustified in blaming you for not asking that specific question.,Human
4dtnx6,"OK, good to know I'm not the only one thinking this way.",Human
4dtnx6,"Not the asshole. At all. I used to work at a woodshop. A 6'x18""x1"" sanded and finished board for $300 is a ripoff. Plain and simple. Anyone with any remote skill at the job could whip that up in a day and everything beyond the first hour would just be waiting for the finish to fully dry so no actual labor cost in that. 

That line about how long it will taste to sand down is utter bs. Something like that isn't that hard to sand if they have decent equipment which any semi-professional shop should have.",Human
4dtnx6,"Good to know this level of insider info, this is super helpful!

Now that you're here, I was wondering what you would suggest if I wanted to acquire or even put together a wooden desktop of those dimensions. What would be the most cost-effective way to do so?

Would I have to go for solid hardwood, or could I get away with plywood?",Human
4dtnx6,"Plywood would probably be the best way. On the original example of the 18"" wide board the one difficulty I could foresee is getting a board that wide. It's possible but not always available everywhere depending on your supplier. For hardwood the alternative would be gluing two boards side by side and cutting it down to 18 inches. 

Plywood comes in 4'x8' sheets so it would be easy to cut to whatever specifications. Two things with that though: most shops commonly stock 3/4"" plywood not 1"". Plywood also tends to not be as durable as solid wood. It might dent or ding up easily especially if you don't use a durable finish. 

Unless you are going for something elegant plywood would be the way to go all around. If you are trying to save money you can assemble it all yourself provided you have a drill. Just pick up some 3/4"" sheetrock screws from your hardware store. 

If you don't have a table saw or a friend with one you can probably have a wood shop cut all the pieces to a specified dimension. Wouldn't take more than a few minutes for them to do so I can't imagine they would charge much. 

If using plywood you would want to edge band the sides to make it look like a solid piece. A woodshop could do it or you can buy the banding tape yourself. The stuff I always used was iron on but they might have some no iron stuff out there. You also wanna to sand it smooth before finishing but be careful not to burn through the top layer of the plywood. 

Then comes finishing. Finishing can b",Human
4dtnx6,"This is amazing, thank you so much!",Human
4dtnx6,"Np. Some design tips. I dunno the style you are actually going for whether its a table style or a framed cabinet style. If it's a framed cabinet make the frame separate from the table top. 

You can do something simple like a box(well..rectangle) frame. Standard desk height is 28-30 inches. If you go for 30 then the frame itself should be 29 1/4 high to account for the top assuming you are going with a 3/4"" board for the top too.

You could do something like I have in [this](http://imgur.com/w1461r1) rudimentary drawing.

The white would be the sides shown top and front. Those could be 18 x 29 1/4 x 3/4. The other 4 pieces shown in colors could be something simple like 2"" x 6' x 3/4. 2 of those long pieces would be vertical in the back of the desk frame. for structural stability. 2 would be horizontal on the top of the desk frame. You would then screw the table top on from the bottom through the two horizontal ones so no screws show on top of the table top.

For even more aesthetics if you take it somewhere to cut the pieces they might have a pocket screw jig to predrill the holes out of the 2x6 pieces so you don't have to plant the screws in the sides of the desk. Google pocket screw if you are unfamiliar with the term.

This entire thing, table top and all, could be done out of a single 4x8 of plywood. Alternatively you could spend a little more on wood and less on finish and have the frame done out of plywood and the top done out of a melamine. Black maybe. A nice finished",Human
4dtnx6,"Awesome. All I need is the desk/table top. It will be resting on top of two filing cabinets. Nonetheless, this is very helpful!",Human
4dtnx6,Heh np. Bored at work and this kept me entertained. If you want to get away cheap and don't care too much about aesthetics then go with melamine. One quick cut on a table saw is all you would need. Edge banding would make it look nicer otherwise just take a piece of sand paper and run it along the edges to break them as to not be sharp. ,Human
4dy1f9,"Too close to call. The Walmart in my neighborhood has these wheels, but my experience has been that the cashier loads the items into the bags. They usually do it as they scan things; at the Walmart, there isn't enough counter space to leave the items sitting. 

So, on one hand, I don't think the cashiers should refuse to bag the items. On the other, I don't know why you can't bag them, either. I don't think you're *entitled* to have your items bagged; I've never seen bagging as a service I'm paying for.  

If I was in line behind you, I would totally get what you're doing and even agree with you that the cashier should bag your stuff, but I'd give you an eye roll for not just bagging it yourself. It just isn't a battle I would fight.",Human
4dy1f9,"I know some stores have reduced prices and as such you either bag your own groceries or you may even have to pay for bags if you didn't bring your own. You pay less because they have less employees to pay and as such, there is more participation from the customer. 

Yes, I think you are an asshole. If it is expected everyone will bag their own groceries, but you just stare at thw cashier until they give in, that's asshole behavior. ",Human
4dy1f9,"The Walmart method is another interesting thing to throw in the mix, as the stands are quite similar and the customer is already conditioned to have the cashier place the items in the bag then rotate the carousel.  The difference, that I've seen, is the distance between the cashier and the carousel is much further at my grocery store than it is at Walmart.  At Walmart they can scan and bag in one move, but at the grocery store they would have to take a step to bag the item.  So is that added distance that disrupts the flow of bagging part of the design to get the customer to bag their own stuff, or is it simply poor design?  

As for the worthiness of the battle, so far I am winning by doing nothing, so I am not really putting any effort into the fight.  It took more effort to write this post than I've had to put into the battle.  If they straight up told me I'm supposed to bag my own stuff perhaps I would fall in line, or perhaps I'd go to the next closest store which isn't much further away.  ",Human
4dy1f9,"I've shopped at places like that and it's something you tend to know going in.  This particular store doesn't offer discounts for using your own bags, nor do I deem there to be any incentive to bag your own stuff beyond not feeling like there are judging eyes upon you.  

So maybe I am the asshole for going against expectations, but in my defense they changed the method without directly informing the customer as to what their intent actually is, I just look at the new set up and go ""They *probably* want me to bag my own stuff, but if they are not going to actually inform me of that then I am going to carry on per usual"".  ",Human
4dy1f9,"I think it is bullshit for them to change the set up and not specify who does what. I'd say the first couple times you went and  played the waiting game with the cashier were fine, you were feeling it out. You did say other stores in the area had a traditional bagging set up. So if you are going to this particular store, with the knowledge that you probably should be bagging and just not doing it then yes you are the asshole. Especially If I'm behind you in line. Try Complaining to the store manager or instigating a riot over unfair bagging practices. ",Human

1. You're slowing down the line to make a point, and a somewhat petty point at that.

2. You are observing others bagging their own items, so claiming ignorance of ~~store policy~~ expected behavior doesn't work.

3. Even if there is no store policy in place, why fight this fight? You're just punishing the cashier with your passive-aggressive challenge, and they likely had nothing to do with this change.

If it bothers you this much *say* something to management, ask someone for clarification, or *just go somewhere else*. Continuing to do what you've been doing makes you the asshole.

Where I live, all supermarket checkouts are manned by one person who does both the scanning and the bagging as they go, it's standard here and nobody ever complains about it. However there is one chain that does not bag groceries and instead has a long counter along the front of the store for you to take your groceries and bag them after the cashier scans and you pay. If you're buying a cart full of stuff, you pretty much have to reload the cart, walk it two metres, unpack it, bag it, put it back in the cart. I fucking hate going there because it's a pain in the ass, but about 80% of said chain's products are exclusive to them. It sucks but you kind of have to play by their rules, it's not the cashier's fault the store changed some operational methods. I just limit how much I buy there.

You told them what you wanted to do for your birthday and they disregarded what you said and they did something that makes you uncomfortable. You are not the asshole.",Human

4e22v5,"Not wanting a party...  not an asshole.  

Getting into an argument after your parents already planned a party and invited extended family..   useless.  
   
Get used to ""having"" to attend, or being obliged to participate in family events when you don't want to.     Most of the family events in my 50 years.. my own family and friends..   every time at least one or more of the folks there really didn't want to be there.     Do it, smile about it,  and do your best to enjoy the company.   The next time you see any one of them could be the funeral.

But are you the asshole? No, but probably neither are they and you still have to go. Better to make the best out of it.",Human
4e22v5,"I agree with others are saying about the possibility of there being more to your parents side of the story, but bottom line, they did disregard your request after asking what YOU wanted for YOUR birthday. To be honest, I know exactly how you feel. Tomorrow will be my 20th birthday, and I honestly don't want anything to do with it. For both sentimental reasons as well as personal. I'm essentially being forced to celebrate it with plans I dont agree with, but I came to a newn conclusion. Your birthday isn't just about you. It's about your parents and family remembering the day you were given life. And whether it kept a husband and wife together, or succeeding with a small percentage of being able to get pregnant, I can't imagine how precious that day must be for a mom and dad.

If not for you, enjoy it.for them. It's only because they love you.happy birthday, pal.",Human

4e30xv,"Yes. You are lazy. Why are you at your husbands' (im guessing, because of that so nonesense) parents house on garden dirt day if you were not gonna help? Didja make them lunch or do anything productive to the group or just watch the baby sleep? Weird.",Human
4e30xv,"It was at our house.

I wasn't watching the baby sleep; I was looking after her. As every day, the only down time was when she was sleeping, when I did a bit of housework but was also took a bit of time for myself.",Human
4e30xv,"I wasn't sitting right next to the baby, I was in the next room. We don't have a monitor, as our house is small enough that we can hear her wherever, but the garden is quite big so I probably wouldn't have heard her from the end of the garden where the soil had bern dumped.

The in-laws are ~60 y.o. Sometimes MIL looks after the baby while I cook or something but in this case both in-laws wanted to be in the garden as they were the ones who knew what the plan was (where and how to move all the soil). They'd arranged it; I didn't know anything about it.",Human

It seems, though, based only from what you said, that you still have some ""unfinished"" emotional business with the ex which might eventually make you act irrationally if not dealt with properly. Like how you said ""you wished"" she saw you leave with the new girl. What I'm saying is on a future situation, you might do something asshole-ish because you still had some feelings about her. So just beware. I think this is how *crazy* exes start.",Human

4e3tjy,"There was no loud argument in public. I also didn't blow up. We broke up after a calm, rational discussion that happened to make me angry. In public she said something rude to me so we had a conversation about that. Don't misrepresent what I said to make me look like an asshole.",Human

Also, do not blame others for your bad behavior. Statements like 'she made me lose my temper' is one of the main indicators of an abuser. Thats not my opinion, you can Google that! There are other troubling things you say and ways that you speak. 

I stand by my advice that you should walk away from this.",Human

Losing one's temper doesnt mean i grabbed a glass and chucked it across the room or screamed at her. You need better context because if I had done that I probably would have mentioned it. Take your own advice and don't blame others for your grand overassumptions of what people mean when they explain how they were feeling.

Essentially the way they put their foot down it shows that they see themselves as doing you a favour by allowing you to stay for the price.

That is the real issue. With family paying more may not help. You could offer more under the guise of a right to privacy but they could take the money and back out on it. Moving is your best bet to maintain relationships.

I couldn't imagine having randoms staying in my room. Fuck that noise.

And that's exactly what the sub is for. We still like to give advice though, but that's not official. I agree with everyone else, and also hazard a guess that maybe they want you to leave? In their eyes, they helped out a nephew, by boarding him for whatever reason - maybe it was more convenient, maybe nothing else came up, or maybe they needed the extra money, but now it seems you earn a bit more, and they kinda want their own space back now. People are weird and can't come out and discuss it, so maybe they're trying to give subtle hints that they want that space.

Perhaps come out and talk about it. If you can amicably agree that you will look for a new place, they'll probably leave you alone in the mean time.",Human

I moved in with them because I needed somewhere to live (moving back to my parents' was not an option - it would have been too far from my job at the time), after pulling out of a lease at another place because I didn't mesh with my former roommates and I didn't like the fact they were heavy pot smokers, exacerbated by a new roommate coming in (friend of one of the roommates who had been evicted from his last place), who was a total deadbeat. At that point I was paying all the bills, expenses, etc, and they would frequently fall behind, so I was like ""fuck this, I'm out of here, it's all yours now"".

I appreciate that my aunt helped me out, I really do.

A few years back, I was out at a VERY nice restaurant (There were 6 of us for dinner, our bill came out to over $3k. A buddy won a big jackpot at the local casino so he was treating his friends/wives.)  

Anyway, after dinner, we go into the bar, and my friend wants to do shots of [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_de_R%C3%A9my_Martin). So all the guys belly up to a table, I'm the only woman left, and I'm the DD. I'm stone cold sober. 

There was a barfly there. She looked to be pushing 70. Dressed very nicely, all designer, drunk as shit. I mean, I can't believe she was walking. She kept coming over and getting all touchy with my husband. I'm not a jealous woman, I've been with my husband at strip clubs, so women touching my husband is not something that just sets me off. This goes on for longer and longer. The guys start talking about how she's making them uncomfortable and tell her to please go back to her table. 

She does, just long enough for another couple shots and comes back. My poor husband... she tries to CLIMB into his fucking lap, and tells him, ""come on, buy me a shot."" I look at him, and mouth ""can I?"" he just nods. 
I shoved her as hard as my foot would push. She fell off his lap, this didn't phase her. She gets up and puts her arm around him, basically flashing her tits in his face. I shove her away and told her that he was my husband and if she didn't keep her hands to herself, I was going to be taking her out",Human

I'm sorry, but that's really funny!    And I'm picturing a guy (not you) thinking he got one over on Gamestop because he played fast and loose with the batteries.

I have to say, though, why try to return a third?  It seems obvious it's a design flaw, which seems ridiculous to me to spend that much money on a shitty controller.

Not that I enjoy being ""that guy"" at the customer service counter, but I deserve my money's worth. This controller is supposed to be perfect, and there are plenty of reviews that say that very thing. So they're not design flaws I'm running into, they're manufacturing flaws. The original 360 controller's D pad was a design flaw. The PS4s stick rubber was a design flaw. I wouldn't keep returning a PS4 controller every other week saying ""the rubber is wearing prematurely"". Cause they all will.

Or return it, get the money, and find somewhere else to go. 

If that is the case and it is a manufacturing flaw, it shouldn't  be a problem getting it refunded, especially if you explain it to them. If you go in expecting a certain product, you should be getting that product, imo.

4ejeez,"yes, you would be the asshole if you keep returning controllers. The store  looses money everytime you return a broken product.

""As part of the GameStop family of technology brands, we will provide you with world-class service and products. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, let us help you with a replacement, return, or exchange....

*Opened New accessories can be returned or exchanged within 30 days""

I like the controller just fine. I love it, in fact. What I don't like is companies like Microsoft charging me a premium price for something that has the potential of not being top quality. GameStop has my back on this. They know shit like this happens with products, and they know they would have gone out of business a long time ago if they didn't handle it by way of ""bring anything back within 30 days, we'll give you a new one, no problem."" 

(and yes, I know they state 'replacement, return or exchange' so that by the tenth replacement the manager can try to find another solution to satisfy the customer. It is not so that I have to be stuck with what I've bought just because it's not technically broken.) 

",Human
4ejeez,"I know the return policy because I used to work there. I'm letting you know that if you keep returning things over and over when its not broken that they could ban you.

They only take opened items back if they are damaged, because they can't sell an open item as new anymore.

Like I said, slow your roll, Kojak.

And if you want to be the spineless dweeb that won't take a multi-million dollar corporation up on it's own policies because you've been brainwashed from being a manager yourself, be my guest. But I'm not going to just bend over and take it and accept a lemon because GameStop might be out a couple dollars if I don't. That's their problem, not mine. 

That's why GameStop is so successful... Jesus, did you even pay attention to the videos when you got trained? I never worked there and I know more about the business than you do. 

GameStop's bread and butter works like this: GameStop sells the consoles with hardly any warranty or return policy because the manufactures will handle those. Then GameStop picks and chooses what it feels are the best selection of accessories to go with them and sells those, with their name behind it. 

Customers can rest assured that when they go to GameStop, the selection of items to choose from is of a certain level of quality. They know that because GameStop is one of *many* companies that makes *sure* their customers don't walk out the door with a piece of crap. Or if that's the case will give a refund. ",Human
4ejeez,"Jesus, are you 14? Gamestop doesn't offer endless replacements until you've found the perfectly symmetrical controller. You even admitted that you would be lying if you told them it was broken. That's the unethical part that makes you an asshole.             
                  
You could probably take it back a few more times before they start getting annoyed, but I just wanted to give you fair warning that you can't keep taking it back until you find the perfect one.            
               
You are actually wrong about Gamestop's ""bread and butter"". They make almost all of their money from used games and accessories. They don't make alot from new items which is why they're very strict about new item returns.",Human
4ejeez,"Ok, you still think I've got some sort of scheme going and I'm trying to get one over on GameStop cause I'm whiny. 
I returned one. And felt like an asshole for it. Then I thought, ""gee, this one seems to have some issues too. What do I do? I can't just keep taking them back. I'll ask Reddit."" and I have since been pondering about how to make sure the next controller I get is the one I'm happy with so I don't have to go through any of this. 

And I'm not saying their b&amp;b is new accessories. Their b&amp;b is over the top customer satisfaction. Doing whatever it takes to make a customer say ""I'm going back to GameStop for all my gaming needs"". 

I'm sorry you have to hear this, but that means *putting up with the customer that wants to get the damn controller he paid for*. Within reason, of course. But not turning away someone a second, third, fourth, or God forbid a fifth or maybe even sixth time they come back. And do you know why? Because they keep coming back to *you*.

Who's to say they don't buy a new pair of headphones while they're in there to do an exchange? Or a couple new games? They've already bought an Xbox One, games, and an Elite controller from you. If this little speed bump about a controller turns into a big issue with the manager, kiss that customer goodbye. That's easily a thousand dollar bill a year or more walking out of your store for good. 

You're clearly not looking at the big picture. How many customers did you ban from your store? Maybe not many ",Human

Lying to take advantage of a return policy is literally a scheme. If you think there is an actual defect then you're fine, but that's not what you said in your post. Is it or is it not fucking defective? Make up you mind.

As a side note: I hate to burst your bubble, but the biggest complaint we heard from customers was about the return policy. You can pretend to know the buisness all you want, but you have zero experience and no concept of how businesses run.",Human
4ejeez,"If the unit doesn't perform as advertised, it's defective. Every button on the controller (you know, the important parts) is supposed to be a precision piece of hardware, not most of them. If it feels like I'd rather be using my 360s Dpad over this one, I'd say that's defective. If you say it's not because it technically still works then you're an ass. 

And I happen to think GameStop's return policy is fucking amazing. I don't know what kind of stuck up snob town you live in. 

And you better believe customer service is the number one most important thing to a retail store, big or small. If you don't understand that, then you're the one with no idea how businesses run.

4ek19h,"I wouldn't say you're an asshole.

Relationships are demanding. They require work and sacrifice. Furthermore, you're entitled to how you feel about the relationship, and well within your right to bring up concerns regarding that relationship.

What this means for you going forward is another conversation. However if you brought your feelings up civilly, and within all fairness to you, your SO, and your relationship, then you're not the asshole.",Human
4ek19h,"This is not an ""asshole"" situation. 

Two people head into a relationship with individual expectations of what that relationship will be like, they bring different wants and needs and ways of acting. Ideally, people would fall in love with people who completely match them in all these respects, but that rarely happens.

It's great that you've raised this with your SO to give him the opportunity to change his ways if he wasn't previously aware of how he was behaving and/or how you perceived his behaviour. But based on your post, your SO has made it quite clear that he's either not bothered by the way his behaviours affect you, or if he is bothered, he's still not that motivated to do anything about it.

Your SO is showing you how he acts in the relationship. Your job now is to decide whether to accept that or not. Every relationship requires compromise and if all other aspects of the relationship are good, maybe this is something you decide to compromise on. But understand that it is a compromise. Accept the compromise and move on.  There's little to be gained by hoping that he will change or by constantly nagging that he isn't the perfect person you'd like him to be.

You and your boyfriend have different ideas of how to display love and affection.  He has plainly said that he doesn't see the value in these things, even if he recognizes that you do.  You're doing things that he never asked for, doesn't want, and expecting him to have a different reaction.  You're also asking for him to do something that he doesn't probably understand and can't ever know if he's done it correctly.

Both of you might want to sit down and learn about each other's results from the [Five Love Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) (there's an online test, but I can't get it to load right now) so that you can better understand and recognize how you express and receive love.  Maybe he's screaming it at you but in a way that you can't hear.

The results of this specific scenario are:

&gt; I just found out from my Mom that I'm supposed to go to my grandma's for dinner tonight.

Did they actually tell you about Grandma's thing earlier and you just found out you forget, or did they make up an event at the spur of the moment and said you can go screw if you already had something planned?  This needs clarification.

I'm on the fence about your mom being the asshole too, because I'm assuming the dinner idea materialized today, and wonder why this dinner--that they didn't bother to plan ahead of time--is so important that you need to miss a pre-arranged birthday party for it.  

--

**Also, do you cancel a lot on your friend?**  If so, I can see why she'd be mad at you for this forced cancellation.  If one of my friends is always there for me, but has a family emergency or problem that makes them flake once, they get a complete pass.  But if they always cancel things and/or fail to show up, and then they miss something important, I think I have the right to be pissed even if they had a great excuse the latest time, because the pattern has already shown they they don't care enough to make room for me.

She went to a GAY bar and hit on a guy.  What did she think would happen?  I think it's commendable that you are concerned about her feelings enough to torture yourself about being an asshole, but I think you're fine.  

The girl's friend, OTOH, is an asshole, for jumping in your shit for being direct.  If the situation were reversed - straight woman in a lesbian bar gets hit on by a man who realizes she's straight, is shot down quickly, and his male friend calls her an asshole, we'd all think the male friend was being oppressive and vile for demanding that she put up with their nonsense, especially at 2AM.  The context is irrelevant though.  Nobody owes anybody anything.  At 2AM, far less is expected/owed.

You are in college and it's easy to be kind of selfish and self-centered at this age. You kind of got the best of both worlds here; you hooked up with a girl, and still kept the quasi-relationship on line for you. Why didn't you chose to tell the girl you hooked up with that you were seeing someone else? It's not straight up lying, but it is dishonest. Good news is, you probably don't feel great about this so the best thing you can do is learn to not objectify anyone and you will probably think twice before not telling the complete truth.

Honestly, when the girl came over to my apartment, I didn't even really want to hook up with her, because I am pretty emotionally attached to the girl I'm in a quasi-relationship with. I was really drunk and made a poor decision, and I know that's not an excuse but I know I wouldn't have made the same decision sober.

I definitely do feel really shitty because I completely empathize with the girl I hooked up with, and I feel terrible that she felt shitty about the whole situation. If a situation like this does arrive in the future, I definitely will tell the complete truth about my emotions as to not complicate things. While I will consider this a learning experience, I wish it didn't have to end up like this for the people involved.

Thanks again for the input!

P.S. As to why I didn't tell her about my relationship with the other girl, I'm honestly not sure. Again, it's not an excuse, but it was 3am and I had been drunk for around 14 hours, and I wasn't thinking clearly. I had a pretty crappy night and I felt bad, and I guess I just appreciated the temporary physical/emotional connection with someone, and I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize it, if that makes sense.

We all have maturing to do, and you seem to be open to learning and adapting. I'm telling you: I'm literally so proud of you, and I don't even know you!! You are self-evaluating, empathetic, and young! Your future is positive and bright; keep working at establishing meaningful relationships, and keep working on establishing your own personal values, and beliefs. Let this moment sink in with you; then let it pass, after all, it is in the past. One of the best things you can do is to go do something you love that reminds you how awesome you are, and reminds you of the person you know you want to be (and deep inside are). We all slip-up. We all do things that are selfish and self-centered; it's how we learn and grow from the mistakes that makes all the difference.

You can argue self defense.  He grabbed you and kissed you without permission. But I am going to point out the obvious here. Self defense is a *defense*. Used to justify *illegal* behavior. If something you do can cause medical bills and criminal charges, it is not okay.

So he is an asshole. But resorting to violence, escalating after he released you, makes you an asshole too.",Human
4fheqa,"&gt;He pushed me against a wall... *When he released me*

No, I don't think you're an asshole simply because he pushed you against the wall. That's assault. If he pushed you against the wall, I am assuming it was overpowering and the punch was a sort of defense (if delayed). You mention that he had to release you before you were able to hit him. That tells me you were overpowered by him. If I'm reading this wrong, please let me know.

Kissing you against your will is also assault.

If he had kissed you and you later punched him without being in the situation, you'd be an asshole and you would be guilty of assault on him. But in the situation, it's justified. **He is not allowed to do things with your body that you are not okay with,** and that includes overpowering you to do what he wants (immobilizing you against a wall so he can kiss you). 

This can be hard for society to acknowledge sometimes, because we're taught to think, ""After all, it's just a little kiss!"" So whatever the outcome of this subreddit, don't let people make you blame yourself at all in this situation. He is 100% in the wrong here.",Human
4fheqa,"You are not the asshole. You defended yourself after multiple warnings and him escalating to restraining you. If anything, I would say you should have hit him more than once, but I tend to go overboard when people assault my person.  ",Human
4fheqa,"I don't agree with you. 

She was still in the situation, he just thought he made his point. Then she made her point:

&gt;I left the main room to get a drink, and John followed me. He pushed me against a wall and kissed me. When he released me, I wordlessly punched him in the face and it transpires that I broke his nose.

This sounds like it happened in seconds. It was basically assault and she seems to have acted in self defense. He overstepped her boundaries (several times) and he paid the price.

OP: You're not an asshole. John is.",Human
4fheqa,Except kissing her against her will is sexual harrasment and is justifiably illegal behaviour.,Human
4fheqa,"Absolutely not. You told the guy several times you didn't want him to kiss you. He knows you're in a relationship and he's been told to respect it by you and your new BF. If he forces himself on you like that after hearing all that, then a good punching is probably what he deserved. 


Maybe you should take a break from your friendship, if you haven't already. He doesn't seem to respect your boundaries. ",Human
4fheqa,That would be up to a judge to decide if charges were pressed.,Human
4fheqa,"I'm just saying, if the cops were called, they would probably both have charges pressed on them. And he has physical damage. In my jurisdiction,  he'd get indecent assault charges and she could have a battery charge.  

She absolutely has a defense.  But the charge could still happen.  Punching people is illegal. 

",Human
4fheqa,Punching people *without cause* is illegal.,Human
4fheqa,"You are most certainly wrong.

If OP had hit him the first time, she would've been in the wrong.  Instead, she civilly explained that what he did is unacceptable.  If she had hit him the second time, she would've been justified in a disgusted push and some choice language, but instead she chose to explain to him that she was not interested.  Her new boyfriend also explained to him that his actions were unacceptable.  The third time he steps out of line, she defends herself physically after it has become apparent that words have zero effect on this ""man.""  This was clearly self-defense and any judge in your jurisdiction will see that if ""John"" ever decided to press charges.

However, I am curious: if this had been a situation where she'd had no other recourse (i.e. could not scream for the people in the other room), would you be doubting her methods then?",Human
4fheqa,"On the asshole scale, ""kissing a woman who has told you (and so has her SO) that she's not interested"" &gt; ""breaking someone's nose in self-defense.""

When a person disregards your boundaries, they should anticipate a fight.",Human
4fheqa,"I never said she would be convicted.  I said she could be charged.  Think about what a cop would see if he walked up to this situation.

But her name would be in the police blotter. And the incident will pop up on in depth background checks.

It was self defense. But it was also an escalating behavior.  What if he had punched her back?  Or, as a different what if - what if she recognized that this guy refused to respect her boundaries and decided to stop hanging around him?",Human
4fheqa,"I am not saying it isn't self defense.  I am saying that she was an asshole for not recognizing that this guy is a predator and taking steps to remove him from her life.

Your situation is different.  You (I assume) were a minor. Your parents were responsible for your personal safety. They failed. They should have been held responsible for that failure. I am sorry that they failed.

This woman had several chances to cut this guy out. She failed to do that.  Yes he is an asshole. Yes what he did was a crime. But she escalated the situation, which could easily have turned out poorly for her. Her punch could have had long term ramifications for her. She was thoughtless and short sided. Which is why I think she was also an asshole.",Human
4fheqa,"If her (actually this may be a dude talking) boyfriend is friends with this guy, why would the onus not be equally on him to cut this guy out of their lives? Why is it solely her responsibility?",Human
4fheqa,"I *highly* doubt there would be charges filed, as you already said it yourself:

&gt; It was self defense.

It would not be seen as an escalating behavior in this case because it didn't escalate.  There is also not enough evidence to suggest that it was an escalating behavior, but it would be had he gone at her physically.

&gt; Think about what a cop would see if he walked up to this situation. A guy with a busted nose and blood down his shirt, and a girl with a bruised hand saying ""I did it because he kissed me."" Charges.

First, she would have said, ""I did it because he kissed me without permission."" second, you're assuming the cop is walking in there, taking a quick look around hearing two sides to the story, and leaving with two people in handcuffs.  There are still other people in the dwelling and they would be asked what happened.  It would be on them to let the officer know that she would have been in the right because John has a history of acting this way.  The cop would hear everything before making a decision on who to arrest, especially if her reasoning was exactly as you stated.


&gt; That may be dropped later, or she would be found not guilty. But her name would be in the police blotter. And the incident will pop up on in depth background checks.

I work in background screening and no employer would find out about it if there was no conviction.  I also doubt something this trivial (would be different if it had resulted in an actual rape or her savagely beating ",Human
4fheqa,"That's fair. Her boyfriend should also cut this guy out. But if he doesn't want to, she still gets to decide who she hangs out with.

lol the very definition of victim blaming. ""OP, you're an asshole for not predicting that this was going to assault you. Freaking harness your Seer powers already, *gosh*."" Women and their refusal to predict the future, amiright?

&gt;They should have been held responsible for that failure

As should the person who performed the assault. You're pretty big on placing the blame on the people who *can't predict when an assault will occur and thus don't prevent it*, aren't you?

&gt;But she escalated the situation

How the actual heck did she escalate the situation, by having lips? By going into another room?

This message needed to be responded to. I hope anyone reading this knows better than to believe what's been said here. This is 100% wrong. **When someone assaults you, it is not your fault. It is** ***their*** **fault for choosing to hurt you. Not your fault for failing to predict that they would and stopping them before they did.** Please don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. **No one is responsible for someone's bad decision** ***except the person making the bad decision.***",Human
4fheqa,"I am going to stand by my position that I have argued this entire time. He was wrong. He was the most wrong. 

But. Her punching him was also wrong. Less wrong. But still wrong.

This isn't binary. He assaulted her = asshole. She refused to keep herself away from a *known* danger = asshole. 

I am now getting the infamous ""you are doing that too much"" notice. So this will be my last comment on this thread.",Human
4fheqa,Did we just come to a complete agreement on Reddit? Shit I should go buy a lottery ticket. ,Human
4fheqa,"This is completely binary.  In no way did she do *anything* wrong.  She only hit him the one time, which de-escalated the situation by incapacitating him (had his nose not been broken, he would've been able to focus enough to lash out physically), as opposed to beating him severely, which would warrant the charges you so desperately want brought against her.  

&gt; She refused to keep herself away from a known danger = asshole.

Again, this doesn't make her the asshole because *she didn't know that he was a danger*.  In the two prior incidents, he didn't use force to have his way, he simply made a move before she was able to react.  That doesn't give any indication that he would soon turn violent in his actions.  She and others, being friends with him and knowing him a long time, chose to give him the benefit of the doubt because *he was a friend.*  Also something worth noting: in your entire argument, both with me and others, you haven't once said that *he* should've changed, only that his actions were wrong, but you've also been quick to castigate the victim here for not having extrasensory perception or a crystal ball.  You must be one special guy if you can accurately predict who will attack you and when.  And just so you have one more repetition of how wrong you are, here's u/ApricotPickles again:

4fheqa,"&gt;Countering violence with more violence isn't the solution.

Sometimes it is. Like when someone or something forcefully and aggressively invades your personal space and you need to protect yourself. This isn't to be tolerated. Protecting yourself should never be viewed as going too far.

&gt;Honestly, I'm tired of women saying they're not responsible for what happens to them because they were drunk.

In some circumstances I totally agree with you, but this rhetoric has no place here. This is a case of one person forcing himself on another. While not rape it is an unwanted invasion of personal space. It should not be tolerated. It is not a case of 2 drunk people consensually hooking up, and then the woman claiming an inability to consent because of intoxication when really both were intoxicated.",Human
4fheqa,"Look, I know what I'm talking about because I've been there a few times.  When I was in college, I was sleeping, and a man came in my room while I was sleeping and got on top of me.

But she wasn't protecting herself.  He had already let go of her when she punched him.  She was angry, and rightfully so.  And alcohol absolutely is part of this.  It's possible she wasn't entirely forceful in saying no him.  Who knows.  But I still say violence isn't the answer.  Really she didn't have to break his nose.",Human

That's blatantly telling him to his face that you want to exclude him. Not even trying to sugar-coat it with some sort of ""reasonable"" excuse.

Well, you've got a reason or two for disliking him.

It seems like you're failing to realize that your other friends are allowed to have friends. You're not required to really like him, but you should at least *tolerate* him.

I'm not going to tell you you **must** stop trying to drive a wedge between ""the guys"" and Billy, but you **are** putting yourself in a position where ""the guys"" are measuring your value and his, and if you force them to make a choice between the two of you, it might not be in your favor.

Step up and tell him why you can't be friends anymore.

You can't really compel another person to support you through school, even if it's your partner. To be the better person here you may need to drop your expensive hobby and save up. Make your dreams clear and hope your partner is generous. Whining may become an asshole move eventually, especially if it's proven ineffective and you're just using it as a crutch to avoid making changes to yourself.",Human
4fyuff,"Not being able to hold a job for longer than 6 months seems like an issue. I wouldn't be able to live with that kind of instability. It seems very immature to me. Work is work. It isn't supposed to be play, even if you are lucky enough to wind up with a career that you find rewarding. It sucks sometimes, and you have to put up with it sucking to get to where you want to be.

But ultimately, a situation like this is too complex for the scope of this sub. You might want to look into talking to a marriage counselor before this becomes too much of an issue. Or maybe that isn't the best advice. I don't know. However, it will take more work than just determining a person to blame.",Human
4fyuff,"One detail that i think is important, that you haven't explicitly stated (though I can guess based on the fact that you're posting your question here), is how your husband reacts when you get on his case. 

Either way, I wouldn't say you're an asshole for advising him against his potentially dangerous behavior. While there are indeed other important factors, like how you've agreed to divide expenses and whether any of his income helps support your hobby, I am inclined to say that you're not an asshole since his behavior is quite obviously unhealthy and risky from a financial well-being standpoint. 

However, in my opinion his reaction to your comments will determine whether he is an asshole, or whether there are no assholes here. Failing that detail, I am **assuming** that he gives you a hard time when you talk to him about this, and **would therefore find that he is the asshole**.

Separate from all this, if I were you I would try to help him determine why he does this - is it possible he has a form of psychological condition (ADD?) that's causing him to act this way? That is, if constructive discussion can take place on the matter.",Human

You're absolutely getting the raw end of the deal and I'm surprised people here are actually telling you to give up your hobbies (probably the thing keeping you from snapping under the stress) to accommodate your husband refusing to take responsibility. 

Stuff like this says it all:
&gt;he gets to quit his job whenever, but I don't

When he can't keep a job for more than a few months, it means that even if your job is 1,000x worse, you're stuck because him always being comfortable and happy has become the ultimate priority in your relationship.",Human
4fyuff,"I don't know that you're an asshole, and I can understand your frustration, but there is part of your argument that doesn't ring true to me.

He's not forcing you to keep your current job (unless he's somehow explicitly requested this). You can look for other things. You can even quit and figure out how to support yourself in the meantime.

If you say you can't do the latter, then that would presumably be true if you were on your own, without him. Thus blaming and resenting him for that is misdirected anger. You may be projecting your own career frustration on to him.

You have options. You have free will. If you feel this strongly about changing careers, discuss it with him. Don't put conditions on it or wait for him to do the thing you think he's supposed to do. Discuss, and then act.

While his choices might not be great ones, the one thing he is doing that you aren't is acting.

That being typed, perhaps he needs to learn that you two are now a family and need to behave like a single-unit.  Quitting a job is a big decision with a massive impact on both of you, not just him.

Maybe the next time he starts working at a place you *can* quit your job and take some time to work toward getting a job you won't hate.  If he always feels like he has a safety-net he might always jump.  Maybe he won't be so rash without that net.",Human

I don't think this is a valid criticism/argument. Part of OP's worries are centered around stability for successful planning for the future. If the husband isn't willing to bear that responsibility, *someone else* needs to. Planning for the future requires sacrifice, including staying in a job that isn't ideal (because e alternative, unemployment, is substantially less ideal). With the husband playing hopscotch across jobs, there is no guarantee that his good luck won't come to an end. Who's to say the next time he quits won't be his last? And then if OP is jobless at the same time, this couple finds themselves in serious shit.

The husband isn't explicitly asking her to stay on this job. But his actions are signaling to OP that his desires are for her to stay there.",Human
4fyuff,"You guys need marriage counselling. A marriage is as much a financial partnership as much as a romantic one, and you have good reason to be resentful IMO. That being said resentment is relationship poison, and the whole situation needs to be dealt with proactively.

4fyuff,"I agree with most of what you're saying. However, the second half of the point I was making was that she would still have to do all of that in order to support herself, even if he weren't around. Unless he is racking up significant expenses that his income isn't covering (possible), then OP, in this regard, is exactly where she would be if she were by herself: feeling like she has to keep a job she doesn't want. So resenting him for that may not be 100% valid.

I'm not saying this is a *fair* arrangement, mind you. I get why she would be frustrated and angry. And you may be completely right that the husband may want her to stay where she is, even if he hasn't said as much. But even if he wants that, it doesn't mean that's what she's forced to do. 

She has choices she can make. Keep separate finances/savings accounts. Set a deadline for when she's going to quit her job and go back to school. Look for a better/better paying job in her current industry until she can save enough to get out. Sacrifice her expensive hobby in order to save.

I'm not saying any of that is easy. But she doesn't *have* to keep doing what she's doing. She's blaming and resenting her husband for her own inaction. And he may very well not be making things any easier for her, but ultimately her decisions/indecisions are hers, and she should own that part of it.

The boyfriend is already paying some bills, which is more than most would do, he was doing right by you and then you got greedy and wanted more. If he's sleeping in her room, and eating his or her food, then he doesn't owe you anything. Now yes, 5-7 days a week is a lot, but that's how dating works when it starts to get serious. 

You should have just sat down your roommate, just one of you with her and talked about things, it would have gone much better. ",Human

What it sort of sounds like is you guys didn't take the time to think through whether or not you could afford this place that you hadn't even looked at (which doesn't make you an asshole) and are pushing some of that panic onto someone who is essentially a bystander (which sort of does make you an asshole) - who sounds like a nice, respectable bystander who actually took the initiative to pay for his fair share of expenses.

Edit: spelling and words",Human

Maybe a full 5th of the rent isn't fair but usually a double occupancy means a share and a half of rent as well as two shares of bills.

There's no panic to do with being able to afford the flat (no panic to do with anything actually), and since we were all friends before we took the word of the one who did see that flat and it actually is really nice and we are happy here, so there's no problems to do with needing money and looking for someone to get it from. 

Our issue is that he is living in the flat, and yeah he's not getting his own room but he is still living here and our opinion is that if you live someone then you pay for it.

4g1kro,"not the asshole

i thought it was standard practice for couples sharing a room to pay a slight increase in rent?  that's what most places i've lived have done. 

it makes sense. lets say your house rent is $2000, so each bedroom is $500. that's assuming each bedroom has an occupant with equal access to common space/amenities. now if one of the bedrooms houses two occupants, that's a bigger strain on common spaces and amenities. 

""not a big deal, i bring my own food and haven't moved a bunch of stuff over."" 

doesn't matter. he's still one more person using space in the fridge, he's one more person tracking dust in on his shoes. the trash fills up faster. toilet paper disappears faster. if he has his own car, it's taking up regular space on your street making it potentially more difficult for the rest of you to park nearby. 

one more person to hog up the bathroom first thing in the morning.  

one more face to have to look at when you're having a bad day.  

i dunno, in some houses everyone has differing schedules and there's not much overlap in use of amenities. then maaaaybe they could squeak by with just chipping in on utilities. 

but if you've ever had to wait for him to finish taking a shit so you could go brush your teeth, or if you've ever had to park two blocks away and his car is across the street from your house, or if you needed to use the big pot for stew and he's using it for something else.  

if any of that stuff happens, his not having a key is a formality. ",Human

4g1kro,"Would you be expecting him and the girlfriend to pay more? If not, I don't really see why you'd even care. Let her ask him to pay rent. 

And if you're expecting them to pay more, I'm not sure I agree with that either. They're not getting any extra room for the money than what they have now, and they'll be living on top of each other in one room. Especially if she has an en suite so it's not even affecting bathroom timings.",Human
4g1kro,"Well, if there is no shortage of money, then it just *sounds* like some kind of power trip, by you trying to force someone to conform to what you think they should be doing purely on principle, regardless of actual consequences to you (or anyone else) and at the possible of expense of what sounds like several good relationships. You are all paying money for a room. They don't get an extra room. That's all there is to it.

(I should mention that my thinking on this has changed over the years. I remember being indignant on behalf of a friend when she had to pay half the rent with three people in the house.)",Human
4g1kro,"I think that them paying rent and a half (between them as a couple) would be a fair arrangement from our point of view. That way they are each still paying less than the three other people in the flat, but everyone is that way contributing to living there.

To be honest the reason we tried to have the conversation as the five of us was to figure exactly that out. To look at our options for payment and find something that made everyone happy. Unfortunately it didn't work out like that",Human
4g1kro,"I would disagree that it is a power trip, if it were just me who had the issue, and if I were forcing people and being aggressive then fair enough to the power trip comment. But since three out of the four tenants are unhappy we felt it was something that needed to be at least talked about as a group. Although it would not have major consequences on us, there was a good point made on another comment thread, if the three of us all had girlfriends move in and we therefore had eight people living there, by that logic they wouldn't have to pay for anything, which to me seems ridiculous.

I also want to point out that the fact we are all paying the same rate at the moment negates the fact that we are paying for a room. The rooms in the flat are NOT equal in size or worth and should really be paid for in differing amounts. Because we are paying the same, I see it more as we are paying for a quarter of the entire flat, and therefore if there are five people in the flat as a whole, it should be split that way.

That being said, I do see your point when it doesn't affect us in a substantial way",Human
4g1kro,"the asshole is the person who is living in the place and not paying rent.  All these people saying ""well, it depends on how you spoke to them"" - that's just not the case.

Also, the flatmate who is mad that he moved back home should probably head on over to /r/relationships to get some feedback on dating an overgrown mama's boy who apparently wants everybody else to take care of him, instead of him being self sufficient.

I emphasized ""sounds like"" because I don't think it's that extreme, but it sounds like a situation where it could easily slide in that direction. There *is* a possibility that a majority can get themselves a little riled up and villainize another single person or smaller group of people. I only say this from experience in these situations.

This wasn't an issue in the last place where my boyfriend stayed (I only visited him for two or three days every month, by the way) because the landlord was the person who decided how much each person paid in rent based on room size. There were a few couples who moved in, and it didn't change anything about anyone else's rent situation. I don't think anyone even gave it a second thought.",Human

4g1kro,"As long as he does his household share and pays his share of the bills, I think that should suffice for any use of the ""public areas"".

For the rest, he's occupying the same room as his girlfriend, so if the girlfriend pays full rent for that it should be okay IMO. It's not uncommon to think of rent as payment for a bedroom that's ""your own"", and all the other bills+household tasks as ""payment"" for the common areas and object and services you use.

It's cool that he paid utilities. That he had his mail delivered there is weird but is really not relevant to the fact that you're asking someone not in a rental agreement to pay rent. I can totally see where you were coming from, trying to find a solution that allowed him to in effect stay there as much as he wanted, but it's a bad idea borne of financial and interpersonal stress. Being less accommodating to him would have been better.",Human

4g1kro,"I get that leaving money out of it would have been more ideal, but the problem with being less accommodating is that he is the boyfriend of a flatmate and therefore we felt we had more of a right to ask for rent than say you have to stop coming round.

Your lease agreement may have some rule about guests where they must be considered full-time renters if they stay beyond a certain amount of time. If that is the case, I think he definitely should pay rent (I think your proposal of 1.5x rent for the couple is fair) or stay less than the specified time.

So why are you a fuccboi? Well right off the bat you start with the no homo shit. I mean goddamn son even fucking teenagers dont say shit like that anymore. That's some major fuccboiery there.

Then your reaction. Now don't get me wrong this guy sounds like a fuccboi too. But instead of handling it like an adult, you just go from ignoring it to fighting fire with fire. There's no mature middle ground, just childishness. It's a fuccboiaganza. And even after it gets physical, you still don't really do anything about it. And then you ignore him? Christ I think that's actually the most fuccboi thing ever. Are you a 7 year old girl? The silent treatment? Damn.

Third, how do you know she is the right person for you? You don't. Have you tried talking to her, or telling her how you feel?

4ghpcw,"The FAQ for /r/bodyweightfitness says you would see progress in the exercises 2-3 workouts in. I haven't properly measured it, but back when I did exercise I remember things got easier quite quickly (jump rope, not weights). ",Human
4ghpcw,"And that's when you're actually *trying* to change, right?

Like you're actively challenging yourself?",Human
4ghpcw,Yeah I guess so,Human
4ghpcw,"Okay.

Let's do that with therapy. Let's go in there and actively *try* to change, listen to our therapist, be 100% truthful, *ask* for help, suggestions, and coping methods, and not go in thinking ""It's not going to work.""

Let's see what happens after six sessions.",Human
4ghpcw,"I was 100% truthful. I went in there and the first thing I said was ""I know I'm going to be alone, is there any way to deal with this?"" (not word for word, but you get the idea). She didn't say anything really. Just asked questions and said things like ""I can tell you're feeling really down"". No shit lady, why do you fucking think I'm here? Honestly, if all counselling is like that, the whole practice should be shut down. ",Human
4ghpcw,"&gt; ""I know I'm going to be alone, is there any way to deal with this?"" (not word for word, but you get the idea)

That's not trying, though :) That's not trying to change anything. That's showing up to the gym going, ""I know I can't lift ten pounds so I'll stick to five"" and never challenging yourself, thus never seeing change :)",Human
4ghpcw,"&gt; It does make logical sense I'll be forever alone, I posted some numbers (one real, a few guessed) below. Ctrl+f 90%.

You're believing in the classic fallacy of depression: things have been like this so far, that means they will always be that way. I believed that too. Except that's very rarely true; things change. Sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes indifferent, but they don't stay the same forever. Believing that they'll stay the same is contrary to reality. That makes your belief inaccurate at best, illogical at worst.

I understand what you mean about being bad at being a person. But ""being a person"", as you describe, is a learnable skill. It's not a preprogrammed genetic ability. Sure, different people find it easier than others, but it can be improved upon by everyone. Thus, where you are now doesn't have to reflect where you can/will be. That's not a platitude I'm spewing at you -- you practice something, you get better at it. That's a fact. 

On to ""ugliness"": I don't know you, maybe you truly are hideously ugly. But I doubt it. Do people shy away from you on the street because you are so malformed or repulsive? That's what ""hideously ugly"" would be. Or are you just average, or even just below average looking? That's not the same thing. Yes, being good looking makes it easier to meet people than not, and maybe you're not. That would make it harder. Not impossible. Ugly people find relationships, too.

As far as communication, this I know for sure you are",Human
4ghpcw,"&gt;Well I am taking antidepressants now

I hope that works out for you then.

&gt;I'll probably try CBT eventually, but I don't really have time for it right now

http://www.llttf.com/ has some examples you can listen to in the space of 10 minutes, if I remember correctly - if you want to get a rough idea of how it works. Some of it sounds a bit patronising though.

&gt;What's learned helplessness

Well in your situation it pretty much means you've resigned yourself to your 'fate' and feel that it's useless to try and get out of it because you don't think anything you do will ever fix it. 

Normally someone feels like this because of another situation they have been in where nothing they do seems to help - it's common in things like depression (especially chronic depression) where it takes a while to find the treatments that work for you and your energy to try is sapped.

There's an anecdotal story sometimes used in motivational pictures that has a similar theme - adult elephants are restrained by flimsy chains around their feet. Someone asks their trainer why they don't break free and he answers that they chained them up when they were young and couldn't break free, no matter how they tried. Way before the time they got to adulthood they gave up trying, so now even though they could break the chain easily they won't attempt to.",Human
4ghpcw,Then I guess my only advice on that front is to try and focus on you. Get your depression sorted out and try to take care of yourself. It's a lot easier for people to like you if you like yourself.,Human
4ghpcw,I agree with this. I also get not wanting to be around disgustingly happy relationship people when you're feeling bad about being single - been there. The best antidote is getting out and doing other things / seeing other friends who make you feel good without focusing on what's missing. This is also good for depression.,Human
4ghpcw,"Everyone is not having great lives. Everyone is not in happy with their fulfilling relationships. Everyone has not had sex. If you admit that there is more than life to sex, why not focus on those other parts? Don't use women to measure your worth as a human being.

Twenty is not some crazy age to still be a virgin or to not have had your first kiss. If it seems like you're the only one, it's only because the other guys aren't talking about it. You're not an outlier.

I think you should work on your self esteem. The idea that people would mock you behind your back is not really how people are in real life, women are not mean high school girl stereotypes. I just don't think this happens with normal people who have an ounce of respect for others. This scenario is your fear talking.

I know you said you tried therapy but it sounds like you didn't click with the therapist and six sessions is not much at all. You are struggling with some really serious and painful emotions and it is going to take some time to grow strong, but that's okay. If I had quit therapy after my first therapist (who was terrible!) or after my first couple of medications and didn't keep searching for the right therapist/drug, I can't imagine how massively fucked up I'd be now. Keep at it- there are no words for how worth it the journey is. You deserve health and happiness!",Human
4ghpcw,"yea your an asshole , your not happy so you dont want your friends to be happy. your attuide is awful.fix your ""poor me outlook on life"" things wont get better unless your lucky or make some changes.
