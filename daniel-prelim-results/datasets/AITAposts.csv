4czypu,,"Early last month I ordered a sweatshirt with some custom stitching on Etsy. I paid a good amount for it and it was finally delivered last Friday. I was super excited to wear it but, unfortunately, there's a hole in the sleeve.

I messaged the seller that night and let her know that it had arrived damaged. I attached pictures and told her that I would prefer if she sent me a replacement sweatshirt rather than a refund, if that was possible. She messaged me back saying she would get back to me Monday with her decision. Monday rolls around, I don't get a message.

On Tuesday, I send her one more message, asking her what decision she came to. She sends me a rude message telling me she'll ""get to it when she can"" and tells me I just have to be patient. I decide to wait until the end of the week to see if she arrives at a resolution for me. Lo and behold, it's now Friday night and she still hasn't gotten back to me.

Since I ordered almost a month ago, my window to open a case with Etsy is narrowing, so I decided tonight to open a case against the seller since the item came damaged and the seller hasn't been working with me. I think that a week is more than enough time to at least tell me the terms of my refund, especially since I sent her proof of the damage, but now I'm second-guessing myself.

AITA for reporting her to Etsy?"
4d3evq,,I let my boyfriend use my car with him promising to be back by 11 p.m. that night. He was gone for 2 days . I don't care that he was not with me. I'm pissed that he had my car and wouldn't return it for 2 days. I had to use uber to get around. He was fully aware of my Important  things I had to get done...which includes going to work. I also realize it's my fault for even letting him use it in the first place. I'm just so confused as to why he is mad at me for nagging him to bring it back.
4d4npn,,"I'm awful at getting up in the morning, and even worse at remembering to text my girlfriend good morning. 

So I set up tasker to text her one of about twenty different messages at a random time around when I wake up (when I ideally wake up; in practice, I sometimes wake up later.)

She hasn't found out that I'm sending them automatically, because I've only just started the tasker profile (no bugs! Woo!)

I'm aware that it could be construed as assholish behaviour, but hear me out. I'm a chronic sleeper-in, and have so much trouble functioning in the morning. I know that good-morning texts are something that she likes, and I want to fulfil that, but I can't because of how bad I sleep. 

I would argue that it's not done out of laziness or indifference to her emotions, because I was the one that wrote the profile and the entire point of it is to make sure that she is as loved as she deserves (which is lots). I wrote all of the messages, and they fit what I normally would text her in the morning. Stuff like *""good morning beautiful! How did you sleep? xxx""* to make sure she knows I care about her.

It kills me that I don't function well in the morning, and am spotty with my manual good morning texts, which hurts her. This is just my attempt at band-aiding a flaw while I work on developing good sleeping patterns.

If people agree it's an asshole move, I'll stop."

4dcnuy,,"Two weeks ago I've started going to the dentist. Without going into exactly why, I've been told that except for one tooth, all my teeth will have to be pulled. Naturally I'm not thrilled about it. I'm only 28, and in addition to that I've developed bald spots and have been struggling with depression. In addition to that I'm not great around strangers, so going to the dentist is already unpleasant to me (pain not withstanding). After I got my first appointment I messaged my dentist over viber to confirm the date and time. She is my age and seemed rather friendly. We talked for a bit after that about random things and joked around. I knew she was married and I personally didn't find her attractive even though objectively I consider her pretty. I made some (in hindsight) possibly inappropriate jokes, but she didn't react negatively at the time. In fact, the next day she told me how much she had to hold back not to laugh too loud and wake her infant daughter. We talked maybe once or twice after that, but not nearly as long. Fast forward a few days later, I'm in the waiting room. She opens the door and tells me to come inside. As I step in I see a guy standing in the room. I'm thinking he's leaving as I'm going in and don't think much about it. I start taking my jacket off and the guy sits down (There's chairs for when she's taking a break in the room, it's separate from the waiting room). Already I'm confused. She tells me to lay down on the weirdly shaped dentist  hair. A thousand thoughts rush through my head. ""What is she doing? Is she gonna pull my teeth in front of that random stranger?"" I'm not feeling comfortable at all about this, but she just casually gives me the anesthetic. As soon as she's done injecting it she starts talking with the guy. I turn around and see him reading patients files. She tells him not to do that,  while smiling and giggling. He just looks at her and smiles back. I'm completely lost and raging inside. She walks back to me and pulls a too"
4diwg3,,"I live in Canada, and I always thought a 15% tip was the standard, normal rate of tip. I tip 15% for mostly everything - restaurants, hairdressers, taxis, nail salon, my tattoo artist. I have rarely, if ever, tipped more than 15%. If I order something for takeout and I'm just picking it up I'll tip 10%. If I'm just grabbing a coffee I'll put my spare change in the tip jar and I tip about $1 per beer at a pub. We Canadians are pretty polite, so even if I got pretty bad service I would still tip 15% (rarely has that happened to me). Recently I was having a conversation with some of my friends and they said that tipping 18% is actually what is considered normal, and 20% for exceptional service. They said 15% was not that great, bordering on rude. Is this true? If so, it's seems like tipping is getting pretty expensive, but perhaps I just need to think of my bill with an extra 18% when I'm thinking about how much I should spend at a restaurant. Am I the asshole for not wanting to tip more than 15%?"
4dmcav,,"I'm a college student who was recently assigned group work for a law-based class. I missed the first meeting of the group (Due to being hospitalized), and came back to chaos. One girl appointed herself leader and then proceeded to do no leading. One girl is going on vacation and is forcing everyone to do the project three weeks early because she's deciding to go on vacation, and then two guys who are actually doing the work.

The biggest AITA came this morning when I started to write up my info. I went online and looked at the documents and realized that, thanks to our ""leader"", we have been focusing on the wrong case for a little over a week now. 

Since I got into this group, I have had to unfuck the leader's lazy delegation, organize group meetings, and apparently realize that we would have failed if we had presented the wrong case in class. Am I the asshole in this situation? I'll answer any background questions in the comments."
4dp5aw,,"By the way, I know I am bias as hell towards my mother. My father and I don't get along that well. 

First of all, my father is in his early 60s and is an avid bicyclist. He's been in this hobby for about 7 years, give or take, after some family issues. However, my mother and I believe that it has taken over his like,I mean, like, addiction levels. 

He has spent thousands of dollars on this hobby and has invested himself into the local government with it. He aims to ride hundreds of miles a month and it has reached the level where my mother and I don't think anything of him riding 70 miles. While I am annoyed in general about all the talk of it, he's always on the equivalent of bike-facebook and gets upset about likes and shit, I kinda don't overly care. Or at least I stopped when I moved out 5 years ago.

However, my mother has always had issues with it. She was happy and supportive at first, but this has declined. She has been angry and upset and hurt by the bike over the last few years. This is due to massive expense, the amount of times he's been hurt by it -twice before this, both times hospitalized. The first time he broke his back and went back to riding and the second time he destroyed his fingers and went back to it -and no 17 year old wants to get a call from the cops that their father was in an accident. 

Anyway, she is also hurt because of the fact that he has neglected the rest of his life. His schedule revolves around the bike, and I'm not kidding. He plans around the rides he wants, has maintenance hours, and does a lot of shit. The problem is that it's in excess, he rides multiple times a week, not including to and from work. 

Because of this, he has neglected the house, badly. They have a pool, and it is basically a swamp. The house needed a lot of maintenance for a while, due to damage from a storm, and the house was left missing infrastructure for about 2/3 years. Apperently, whenever my mom tried to fix it, my dad would get upset that she was "
4dqv6w,,"So my boyfriend has a habit of just opening messages, seeing them and just not replying. I have social anxiety and it made me really uncomfortable messaging him so today I just asked him to please not do it anymore.

4dswx1,,"I am incredibly ""uninformed"" because I have never looked at any news for most of my life. Anytime someone starts talking about politics of any kind, I make sure I either back away from the conversation or tune out completely.

4dtnx6,,"Hi all, I need to know if I'm the asshole.

I am looking for a simple slab of wood that I can use a desktop when placed upon some sort of support (ex. filing cabinets). In early March I contacted a freelance woodworker on Craigslist who said that they could make a desktop to match my specifications (6' x 18'"" x 1""). This is what happened:

-I very explicitly stated that before moving forward, I wanted to know how much the piece of wood would cost. They said, ""It kinda of depends on how long it will take to sand it down. As it is now $60."" They asked me if I wanted a gloss coat, and I said yes. They said it would be ready in early April.

-I contacted them today asking how the progress was going and they said it would be ready by Monday. I asked them how much the total cost would be. Given the only amount of money they had disclosed to me cost-wise was $60, I assumed it wouldn't deviate too much from that. Instead, they were asking for $300 (all for a 6' x 18'"" x 1"" piece of wood). 

-I said: ""I see. You said in an earlier message that it would be around $60-$100. If you look at the initial messages I sent you on March 10th, you stated that. Was there something I missed?""

-They said: ""I said 60 for the 6 by 18 as it was, Without any work put into it. Then I asked if you wanted it sanded and glossed it would all depend on how many hours was put into it and the quality of the finished product. If you buy any type of wood for furniture and it is a finished product it will be pricey not to mention custom made.""

-I said: ""Clearly I have never  bought anything of this sort before, I feel like an idiot. It would have been nice to have had a final price estimate based upon what I asked for, but that was my fault for not being explicit.""

-They said: ""I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.""

-It went back and forth like this, and I argued that they should have been straightforward with their pric"
4dy1f9,,"So about six or 7 years ago I decided to take over cooking and shopping duties for my household of 5.  Long before I took over, and for a few years after, the grocery store had your [traditional style checkout stands]( http://i.imgur.com/zpUTnLW.jpg) where the cashier would take your items from the first conveyor (which you typically loaded yourself), scan them, then place them on a second conveyer that would go to a bagger at the end of the stand who would then load your cart.  Practically every lane with the exception of the express lanes was set up like this.  

A couple of years back the grocery store took out the old stands and replaced them with these updated ones that removed the traditional bagger’s area and replaced them with the carousel-style bagging system you typically see at [self-checkouts]( http://i.imgur.com/cx29l8J.jpg).  I suppose you could describe it as a [hybrid of the two stands]( http://i.imgur.com/wgiNaWm.jpg), and though no one comes right out to say it, the intent seems clear to me; They want you to bag your own groceries.  

There are maybe 1-2 baggers/runners on shift at the time and day I go, when there used to be about one to every lane.  When they were first installed, it was a nightmare.  Lines were stacked up further back than I had ever seen, customers were upset with the new system and many were not afraid to complain to any employee that would listen.  In the time since they were first installed it has gotten a little bit better, though not as fast as it was before, and I am still not having it. 

 I don’t mind loading my own cart, but I am not going to stand there and bag the groceries when there are plenty of other grocery stores in the area (even ones owned and operated by the same company) that don’t have these new stands.   Every time I shop I play a waiting game with the cashier; who is going to flinch first and start bagging the groceries?  Not I.  I look over to the next lane and see some little old lady bagging her own g"
4dyx18,,"I am a part time nanny/babysitter/housesitter for a family and I have been working for them for almost a year now. The kids are very well behaved and pretty much do everything I ask and I have never had any issue with them. 

It was recently my birthday and I babysat a few days later and the mother (who is friends/acquaintances with my mother and must have seen that it  was my birthday on Facebook) gave me a sealed birthday card before she left, and I opened it after and it had a nice card signed by the kids and a generous amount of cash inside. When they got back they paid me and I thanked them again for the card but didn't mention the cash because I wasn't sure what to say. Now I'm paranoid they thought I was ungrateful for either not opening the card in front of them or for not thanking them directly for the cash. I am sitting again tomorrow night. Should I mention it again? Am I the asshole for not opening the card in front of them? I was extremely grateful for the money because I am finishing up college and applying to med school this June and cash is tight. Should I write a thank you card?

4e22v5,,"It was my 18th birthday last week and my parents decided to throw a party tonight to celebrate with all of my extended family. They asked me if I wanted it a couple of weeks ago and I said no because I dont like being the centre of attention and the fact that it was going to be hosted in a pub. I said that I would much prefer just going out for a nice meal instead. However, they completely disregarded what I said and went along with it anyway without considering if I wanted it or not. They asked me if I was looking forward to it a couple of days ago and I said no and a big row erupted in the house. 

So tonight I'm forced to go to a party for me that I didn't really want and Ill be stuck talking to family members I have nothing in common with about boring stuff in a pub while eating cold buffet food. I appreciate the thought they put into the night and I told them this but they completely disregarded how I felt about it. So reddit, am I the asshole?"
4e30xv,,"Today a truck arrived with literally tonnes of soil to level out the garden. It got dumped outside the house at about 10am and it took my SO and his parents all day to move it.

I didn't help because we have a 7 month old and someone has to look after her. I felt bad just being on my phone when she was napping but I had no idea when she would wake up and if I had been outside I'd have been covered in mud and would not have heard her cry.

Also worth noting is that I had no idea this would be happening; my in-laws arranged this. I greatly appreciate what they're doing for the garden, but they also enjoy doing it; my SO and I never asked them to do it.

4e3tjy,,"I'll try and keep it short, but at the same time I know you guys here like to pick out every detail that makes the OP appear to be the asshole before you fully judge the situation. That is the extent of me being an asshole in this post. I hope you'll agree.

Last week I was invited to an event, a dance, by my ex's roommate. I broke up with my ex two months ago after about a month of fighting about me being insensitive and her being too sensitive. On top of that she wouldn't really participate with me in the things I thought interested us anymore. This was all exacerbated by my leaving the country and her having pregnancy scare. Regardless, we break up because I thought she didn't care much anymore. But she cried so immediately I regretted it.

A week after that we go out for coffee and I tell her I want to get back together. She tells me we need time and not to get my hopes up. I don't give it time. The amount of fury in my head forces me to start an argument. And so a relatively civil break up turns into a post break up fight. As per usual with me. We aren't friends, we don't really talk. There's a major coldness between us that I now wish wasn't there. I asked if we had a chance and she said she didn't think there were romantic feelings between us anymore. I told her I wanted to reconcile the friendship. I understand how she doesn't believe me.


So the question is this. It's been two months since we broke up and I'm seeing someone new. The new girl knows the situation completely. My ex isn't seeing anyone of course. She's a very innocent girl I think and she won't date someone she doesn't have an extreme connection with. I invite the new girl to the dance and honestly I wasn't expecting my ex to be there but I knew it was possible. 

She shows up. I didn't totally expect her to. Like I said one of the reasons we broke up is that she would never get out with me. We even dance. She's says something critical about me. I try to be normal with minimal success because "
4e4jvg,,"OK, so the story is this:

My aunt and I have had an argument over the past few days about a situation where guests will be staying with me in the house. A bit of context: I live downstairs in a studio-style flat - so basically bedroom and living room all in one. I pay my aunt money to stay there, and it's always been assumed that whole space is mine (by all parties involved in this) because I pay board for it and it is completely separate from the rest of the house.

Now, up until a few days ago, this situation was fine. Then she springs onto me that I will need to have guests staying with me mid-week and will be setting up a bed downstairs in my living room. I work full-time and I'm usually out of the house by 7am.

I say 'no', because of this. Her response was 'well, too bad, I'm putting the bed down there regardless of whatever you say'. Never mind that I would have been fine with it if it was on the weekend.

Fast forward to yesterday. I return home to find that my entire flat had been rearranged, *which I had locked up before leaving*, to have a bed smack-bang in the middle of the living room.

We had quite an argument about this. Some nasty things were said on both sides. She threatened me with eviction just because I wouldn't bow on this matter, and used the line 'This is my house, it's my rules, you will do this, whether you like it or not'. In the past if we had extra guests they would stay in the dining room in the main part of the house, but this situation has changed for some reason. She used examples like 'well, you listen to music at 1am (which I haven't done in weeks), so I'm sure it's fine'.

Unfortunately, I had to say 'yes' in the end, and I'm less than happy about it, because her partner, who actually owns the place, put his foot down and said 'My roof, my rules, and I say you let them stay down there, and it'll be like this from now on - I might have people stay down there from time to time and there's nothing you can do about it'.

4eamp4,,"I am in college in the Eastern US and my friend Jed's mom is in town (she's a really cool woman). My friend, his mom, a few more of our friends, and I go to dinner at a local restaurant downtown. At night, the restaurant is a bar, but we get to the restaurant around six pm. 

We are having a nice meal in the side annex of the restaurant surrounded by a few other tables (mostly families), but off in a corner is a group of around five 60 something year olds and they are absolutely blitzed. They are screaming and yelling and laughing at the top of their lungs, and I can barely hear my friends or Jed's mom whom I haven't seen in a few months. After about a half an hour, one of them (codename Ruth) comes over to our table unsolicited and drunkenly says something along the lines of 

""I know we're yelling and making a scene over there, and we're sorry, but we aren't going to stop.""

 Everyone at my table seems to think drunken Ruth is hilarious and instantly forgets the fact that we can barely hear each other over the raucous seniors and tell her not to worry about it, at which point I interject and point out that her group is being inappropriately drunk in a family setting. My group laughs it off and Ruth leaves, but whenever I see Jed's mom, she loves giving me crap for ""yelling at an old lady"".

All of my friends think I am an asshole for this. So does my own mom!

Am I the asshole?

So I put my hand on his chest and tell him to back off he says ""fuck you"" I ask him another time and says the same thing.

4ejeez,,"I've paid Game Stop $150 for an XboxOne Elite Controller. I know it's not their fault if the quality of it isn't up to what I expect a $150 controller to be. My first one had kind of wobbly, loose feeling paddles and the guide button wasn't very responsive. There were other minor things I *could* have complained about (like the spacing of the triggers not being symmetrical, or the d pad sounding really hollow on one of the directions) but I knew that kind of stuff just happens with mass production and I wouldn't have returned it just for that. 

So I returned it for a second one based on the first issues. My new one has the same loose paddles, the same unreliable guide button, and the same D pad issue, but now the D pad is stiff making it difficult to tap rapidly. This makes one more major issue I have with it, but one less minor one since the spacing on the triggers is perfect. 

I know that people have received actual broken controllers directly from Microsoft online and are being told to purchase another one if they don't like it. 

Game Stop's Return Policy allows me to exchange my product for another one within 30 days, but I feel like I'd have to lie and say it's broken if I returned more than one. 

So am I the asshole for constantly returning a product that technically still works in the hopes that I get a better one?

EDIT: Added Note: The controller also comes with 2 AA batteries that aren't supposed to be packed back with it if it's returned. So I dunno, I guess technically I could be accused of running some kind of battery scheme, but I swear I'm not. That sounds so stupid but I feel like I need to say it. "

4emtgf,,"Alright, here's the deal- there's a small basement apartment, and there's four of us in it. Four friends, two bedrooms, two apiece. I spend tons (*tons*) of time at my desk. I eat at my desk, and I often keep the dishes here when the sink is full, and do the dishes after. One of the girls in the other bedroom, I'll call her Jane, doesn't do dishes. Cooks constantly and all the dishes end up in the sink. She's rooming with her friend, and knowing the both of them, she does all the dishes for both of them.

The other girl has *literally* done *all* of her dishes since I've known them, which has been a few years.  

I got home from classes yesterday and I was sat down by the other bedroom (Jane and our mutual friend) and told that I really couldn't keep dishes in my room anymore. It's unsanitary and it's bringing rats and cockroaches to the apartment, which I also noticed of late. I explained to her that I was just waiting for her to do her dishes, and also mentioned that I don't recall the last time she scrubbed the bathroom, or did the dishes, or took out the trash, or anything of that sort, really. I did kinda lay in to her about how much work she's not doing around the apartment.

4eun00,,"About 4 years ago, I had finally gotten my first girlfriend (I was a sophomore in high school, as was she). I had known her for so many years, since kindergarten. We were both pretty nerdy, so we were both rather shy.

Sadly, I didn't get to talk to her as much because of marching band practices after school. But after a while, whenever I would get to see her, I noticed she was really stressed. I mean REALLY stressed, to the point of her hair thinning and such. She was smart, so I didn't think it was just school.

Then she told me a story of her father getting angry and she ended up being shoved into the stove, bruising her hip pretty badly (she was naturally thin). Of course, I expressed my concerns for her health but she kind of brushed it off. I kept noticing things that looked and sounded like she was being abused by her father.

Eventually, I just had to do something. I hated seeing her so stressed and hurt. I went to a teacher I trusted and told him the situation, and encouraged me to go to the guidance counselor, which I did right then. This was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable for me, way outside of my comfort zone.

When I had mentioned telling someone about her issue, she got kind of angry at me. But here I was, telling a counselor about her signs of stress and bruises and such. I did make sure to say I never was 100% sure there was abuse, but signs pointed to it. I was told they'd bring her in and talk to her.

Then the next day comes. I'm nervous all day because I knew she was going to be asked about it. After school... Yeah. She was very upset with me. Somehow, she didn't outright break up with me, but she would barely even speak to me. I ended up breaking up with her (though it was more mutual at this point).

And then, as if I didn't feel bad enough, my friends told me that she was flirting with someone near the end there, and she actually gets together with this guy less than a week after we break up.

I was never really told if there was abuse, if anything "
4euwkq,,"Recently, I finally finished one of those year-long study-this-random-country sort of projects. I got Gabon, and became highly invested in it. I even managed to grab a hat to wear when the school went around and checked out everyone's displays.

Today was clean-up day and I picked up the hat, called a kufi, and had it near my books in math. My occasionally-jerky friend, who I suppose I'll just name Wes,  became immediately interested and put it on, asking what it was. Of course he found the name funny, as it is, fairly enough, a weird name. Despite genuinely really liking the hat, I laughed as well and he continued wearing it, sort-of tilting it to the side in an almost H3H3 sort of way. 

However, throughout the class, he kept on poking fun at it, and laughed at other misc. things, such as my country's name and the name of a different piece of clothing, known as a bou-bou. At this point I became a little irritated, because 1.) I needed to get the notes down, and 2.) he kept on making fun of some of the things that I became so invested in. Wes even asked if he could wear it during a Smash Bros. tournament nearby (he's apparently one of the highest players in the city), as he's ""known for wearing silly hats."" I said yes, because that was harmless in itself, but at the end of the period I made it very clear that I had changed my mind, because he never let up on making fun of it to appreciate anything about it, besides ""it looks stupid.""

I suppose maybe I'm being overly-offended by it, but I tried to make it clear that I wasn't into making fun of something that I had become seriously attached to. 

So, **tl;dr**, am I the asshole for being mad at my friend making fun of a hat from a country that I became passionate about?"
4evqp8,,"So yesterday I went to the park to play some football with my friend jack and his girlfriend Kelly.  


we was there for about 2-3 hours when jack said he was leaving because he was board and hungry so he started walking off, then Kelly said ""well I have to stay because my ride is picking me up here"".
 

Jack turn around and look at us both and said "" well I'm going come on Ben(me)"" the park at this point was getting dark and I wasn't going to leave a girl on her own in the middle of a dark park, so I said ""I'll stay with her till her rides here"" jack replied that with ""fine fuck u both then"" and walked off. 

We stayed at the park for 2 hours nothing happened between us but jacks really pissed because he thinks so choice me over him. So am I the asshole ?  (Sorry if its hard to read pretty bad at putting things into words)"
4ewxq7,,"I've known my friend since we worked together over 10 years ago. We've been best buddies on and off. There's a third dude who also worked with us at the same time. Sometimes we all hang out together, sometimes we hang out independently. Usually guy #3 isn't available because he has a kid and works a lot.   

So friend number 1 gets a girlfriend and its ages until we meet her. When we do finally meet her I found her to be just plain socially awkward in a rude type of way. I put this down to nerves as it was the first time she'd met us and was told by my friend that we were pisstakers (we are, but good natured). 

Turns out, it wasn't down to nerves. She's really like that. She doesn't say anything out-and-out offensive, but it raises eyebrows. For example, my friend lent me an old game. I was convinced I gave it back to him, and he had vague memories of this happening too. I couldn't find the game and told him so at a dinner (with a bunch of other friends), she barked at me ""maybe you should look harder!""

Then we were away for a weekend at my dad's place by the beach. She was a bit of a nightmare. She annoyed the shit out of me and I felt she was picking on my girlfriend a bit. My girlfriend is shy and doesn't always join in on conversations unless there's an obvious way in. We were playing a card game which involved shouting things and somehow my girlfriend won, this girl says ""How does she win? she never says/does anything""

Then we play mini-golf. My girlfriend had never played before and I don't care about golf at all, especially mini-golf, so we don't bother filling out our scorecards. This girl notices my gf isn't filling out her scorecard and shouts the rest of the group that she's ""not participating!""

Then she stank out the toilet. There are many other instances but they would just seem trivial to list. 

So finally, after this weekend we decided we wouldn't hang out with her again. We meet up with the third friend and his gf for lunches and dinners and don"
4ey6tr,,"A little background first: my dad, my boyfriend, and I all live together in a tiny 2-room, 1-br apartment. It's a shitty situation and we're trying to get our stuff together to move out. Also, I admit that I'm an alcoholic, which is part of what got us into this situation in the first place. I go on these crazy binges every few months where I turn into a complete bitch and argue with everyone. It sucks for everyone in the house, and my neighbors too. I have been trying to get help for this problem, in the form of outpatient group therapy. My most recent binge was one of the worst I've ever had, because of the consequences for others.


On my most recent binge (this was only about 2 weeks ago so these events are still fresh), I ended up getting hauled off by police to the county mental hospital. I blame my dad for this, for a few reasons. First of all, my dad initiated the physical violence. He also for some reason told the police that my boyfriend was growing pot in our closet, (he never has), resulting in him being beaten up by the cops, getting searched, and the police tearing our room apart looking for imaginary pot plants. In this whole situation, honestly, I think it was my boyfriend who got fucked the worst. My dad hates the guy for not having a ""real"" job, even though he's been supporting us by working (from home) as a graphic designer and web developer.


So, in a nutshell, because my dad lied to the police, my boyfriend got beaten by cops for no damn reason, I was publicly humiliated (I was in my underwear when they threw me in the back of the car; I wasn't allowed to put my clothes on), I spent 3 days in the county mental hospital on a 5150 hold, my boyfriend was beaten up and his rights were SEVERELY violated, and now I have an elder abuse complaint on my record. Oh, and I also have nerve damage in my right thumb because of the handcuffs (good thing I'm a lefty). I do have evidence of the fight between my dad and me (many bruises from him grabbing my arms"
4eyjqc,,"All right, so this whole situation started a couple days ago. 

(I'll be using fake names)

One of my friends got a video that was sent from a sophomore at the local high school named Dylan. The video showed Dylan and his friend Henry throwing a live chicken in a bonfire and proceeded to dump gasoline all over this live chicken and use a pitchfork to beat the chicken when it jumped out of the fire. The whole time throughout the video, they were laughing hysterically and enjoying it. I have also been told they've killed 5 other chickens but only recorded 1. 

The video was posted in a Kik group chat that had 12 people in it. The video pissed me the fuck off. Dylan had a history of being a little crazy. I don't have a lot of background on it, but there's a story that Dylan held a loaded shotgun to someones head. That story is a little cloudy and don't have information on it. Dylan was psychotic and I feared that he would progress into something more dangerous. I wanted consequences for this kid, and I wanted him to regret what he did

I decided to create an anonymous twitter account and post the video on it and tag people from the school on it. Each day, it got more popular and more people were talking about. Today, it got the most notice. I had over 50 notifications of people messaging me, retweeting it, commenting on it. The account was shared on facebook and snapchat. The account was sadly suspended today as well. 

Today, they were arrested for 1st degree animal cruelty and are currently being held in Juvie.

So, am I the asshole in this situation?"
4f2gtc,,"My friend Pami asked me to come to her birthday today. I set the date, made sure everything was set, yadda yadda. However, I just found out from my Mom that I'm supposed to go to my grandma's for dinner tonight. Non-negotiable. I had to cancel and I feel incredibly awful about it.

She seems to think that I made it up (which to be honest I don't blame her for because it sounds way too convenient to be true) but I swear I didn't. I don't know what to do here. I tried, guys. I really fucking did. There was no way for me to know about the dinner. I rarely talk to my Mom and my dad said I had no plans. 

I feel like I'm always having to juggle family and friends on the weekends and I'm on the verge of a breakdown. Am I the asshole here? How do I make this up to her? It's her 18th birthday and I feel like shit."
4faolc,,"Just for the record, I'm male, straight and in a relationship.

It was my friends birthday this weekend. He's gay. My SO and I went to a gay bar my friend regulars to celebrate his birthday.

It's like 2 am. I'm fucked. And I'm standing in the middle of the dancefloor in my own little world. This chick and her friend spot me and their gaydar is registering I'm straight.

So she comes up to me to chat, she was interested in the get-go and wanted to buy me a drink... What I should have said was ""Listen, I'm really flattered, thank you very much but I have a girlfriend and she's right over there... If you still wanna buy me that drink then awesome, I'll even get the next round. If you don't, that's also cool and I hope you have an awesome evening.""

Instead, I fucking short-circuited and just said BZZZZZ WHIRRRR CLICK No. Thanks. BZZZZ. Cue awkward exchange followed by her friend calling me an asshole.

10 minutes later, she left with her friend, looking defeated, crushed and crying...

This has been eating away at me ever since and I feel like *such* a cunt about it. Am I the asshole?"
4fcsdv,,"I've (31f) been dealing with a fair amount of insomnia recently, and the bf (32m) knows. I'm struggling to stay asleep, thanks to medication and anxiety. He goes to bed a couple hours after I do, and he likes to make a fair amount of noise and movement when he comes to bed. We have our queen size beds side by side, and if he sleeps in his bed I'm fine, but he keeps crawling into my bed. I haven't said anything about this recently, as I'm pretty grumpy due to lack of sleep. I know I should, but before I do I want to know if I'm the asshole for being mad he keeps waking me up?"
4fdt2c,,"I'm in college, and I recently hooked up with an acquaintance of mine. She saw me at a party, and she messaged me a little after and asked if she could come over, and it was pretty clear she wanted to hook up. She came over, we hung out for a while, and we eventually went up to my room. We did not have sex, but we messed around. I chose not to tell her that I am sort of seeing another girl, although we are not exclusive and we are not dating.

Forward to today, she messages me to ask if what we did was a one time thing, and I said yes, because hooking up still felt weird to me since I was in this quasi-relationship. She gets very upset, says I deceived her, and that she would not have hooked up with me if she knew. So I guess, am I an asshole for not telling her beforehand?"
4fheqa,,"I go out quite often with a group of my workmates, one of whom I went to school with and hadn't spoken to in a few years. (Call him John) On a night out we both admitted that at school we had crushes on one another, but that was six years ago, and we had a laugh about it.  
One night John had been in a fight with his girlfriend, and kissed me. I was in a relationship too, and told him that I understood he was upset, but not to do that again.  
A few months later, I'd broken up with my boyfriend. One of our other friends (Matthew) and I got together, but wanted to keep it quiet. John saw me kiss Matthew (we thought we were being sneaky) and I assume he thought I was up for it with anybody? He kissed me and again I told him I wasn't interested.  
Matthew and I have been together for six months now, and everybody knows. Him and John are really good friends, and he's spoken to John about respecting boundaries, as John has a habit of trying it on with girls who are in relationships.  
Last night a group of us (including Matthew) were at a friend's house. We were all fairly drunk. I left the main room to get a drink, and John followed me. He pushed me against a wall and kissed me. When he released me, I wordlessly punched him in the face and it transpires that I broke his nose.  
Am I the asshole? I feel as if there must have been better ways to resolve this, but words didn't seem to get through to him. I haven't spoken to him since, and I'm not sure if I should apologise or not."
4frdhl,,"Aight, so I have this friend, lets call him Billy.  Why not.  He is who I consider my first friend, met in kindergarten and we still talk now (we're in, let's say... early highschool).  Now, lately he acts really weird over really stupid shit.  The latest example is that I wanted to have some of the guys over, so I decided to make a group chat.  One of them told Billy abt the chat and he told me to add him.  I told him there was no chat.  The last time I told him he couldn't hang out with us when I had some other guys over he didn't let me live it down for a month.  I would've invited him, but he can get pretty hostile, and my mom doesn't exactly like him from the few times she met him.  So I didn't say a word about what we're talking about, and neither did anyone else to him, but suddenly he pulls this ""why do you hate me,"" ""fuck you"" kind of shit, and I'm just like ""what the fuck I didn't do shit.""  The next day he acted as if nothing happened and just skyped with me.  I try not to talk to him as much as we would've used to cause' he pulls that kind of shit on me all the time and it's just really annoying.  I feel like I'm being reasonable, but everyone else thinks I'm an ass for it.  I dunno.  
I feel like I worded this shit badly aswell, but whatever.
So reddit, I have 2 questions, AITA, and what should I do - be distant and kinda try and stop hanging out, or try something different?

Edit: My friends kind of act the way i do too, with like... I don't know how to explain.  They could've added him to the chat, but they didnt.  The one that told him about the chat then was telling me/us (in the group chat) about how ""he's special,"" you know what I mean? And what else was I supposed to do?  I kind of felt that the white lie was the best way to go because of how sensitive and hostile he can be... I don't know.  I can see why I'm the asshole here though, but at the same time I feel like I'm not.  Whenever I try talking to him about this kind of crap he just gets angr"
4fw56d,,"Im in highschool and my friend has begun to smoke crystal fucking meth. I didnt know this untill 3 days ago when he took a meth pipe out of his pocket, in the middle of the school parking lot acting it was cool. I said ""meth, not even once"" and drove away.

I get drunk, and text him im not going to be friends with a douche, a drug addict, and witbout a license or even a learners permit (we're 17). 

So now that the backstory is done I can fast forawrd to the next day in the computer labs.

4fxthw,,"Sorry if this is a bit long.

It was my girlfriend's birthday. I was working in a restaurant that day and then we were going out clubbing with her friends that evening. Girlfriend's best friend (L) was meeting her for lunch, picking her up from my work (it was more convenient than our house) then rejoining us later in the evening.

L turns up and sits outside in her car. I go out and say ""Hi, how are you"" etc and she looks straight through me and then barks ""get in the car then"" to my girlfriend. We look at each other like ""okay, what is this about"" and then they go and I get back to work.

I'd only met L once before, we went out to dinner as part of a big group and I didn't get much chance to speak to her but she seemed alright?

Anyway the evening comes and all of my girlfriend's friends show up. We're playing cards and drinking and I keep trying to get L involved in the conversation since she's basically sitting there sulking. We end up playing some drinking game, which I lose so I have to down a *lot* of skittles vodka.

This soon necessitates a trip to the bathroom. I stagger there and L is in there with the door open, fixing her makeup. I can't remember what was said but she told everyone I told her to fuck off. It doesn't seem out of character.

Anyway I sort myself out and then go to the bedroom where the girlfriend is trying to decide what shoes to wear. She selects a pair and then goes back to tell everyone else she's ready, should we call taxis etc. The flat is empty.

We don't think much of it and head out to the club anyway. They're all there and a couple of them (not L) buy us drinks. Girlfriend asks if we can go somewhere a bit more private after a bit of dancing around with some of her mates. She proposes to me (I was very surprised! but it was the weekend of the leap day so I guess okay?) and I say yes...we have more drinks to celebrate and then get a takeaway and wander home. We ran into a few of her friends in Subway but they were being weird and "
4fyuff,,"Hey reddit, this is my first time posting so please let me know if anything needs reformatting and I'll be more than happy to edit.

So here's the deal. I have been married for  coming up on five years. My husband is great, he does a lot of really good things for me, but he has never held a job longer than 6 months. He gets bored or frustrated and jumps ship, often without having lined up another job first. The problem is he's very smart and very charismatic and knows he can easily land a new job so he's just fallen into this habit where he assumes he'll never have problems getting another job. He also gets waaaaay too enthused at the start of the job and basically throws all his energy into that honeymoon period. Then he gets worn out, bored, disappointed and quits.

For example, at this latest job he was brought in as an assistant manager and promised his own store within 3 months. He would come in early, stay late, volunteer to work on his days off, etc and most pay periods he was racking up 80 hours per week. He's salaried, so he's not seeing a dime of over time. On top of that his coworkers are kind of assholes, they consistently show up late, call out, make basic mistakes, etc. So I get it, his job is super shitty. The company just offered him his own store and he put in his two weeks notice - before he even had an interview lined up else where. Now he's starting a new job in a business he'd already tried once before.


I've gotten on his case about this several times before in the past, and pointed out to him that there is no consistency here, we can't plan for our retirement like this, I can't go back to school if he's not working, blah blah blah. I hate listening to myself harp on him because I do understand his job sucks - I really don't want to be that bitch wife who's making coming home after a stressful day at work even more stressful. On the other hand I am stressing the fuck out. I have never worked a job for any less than three years. I am miserable "
4g1kro,,"AITA 
So there are four of us who live in a four bedroom flat, three guys and one girls. We rushed into renting the flat as we were a bit desperate and so three of us didn't view the property before moving in. (Should note that we were all friends before moving in together). Since we didn't all view the place, we all agreed to pay the same amount of rent each month. The rent equals a substantial amount of our income.
The girl flatmate has a boyfriend who, at the beginning of the year, stayed the night on average three nights a week. We were fine with that since he was a guest and bought his own food and we got on with him really well. However, it got to the point recently that he was living with us five or six days a week, sometimes seven.
He suggested paying a share of the bills already, which we accepted.
However the three guys (me included) now feel that he is here so much that he should pay a share of the rent, not an equal five split since he doesn't have a key and isn't on the tenancy agreement, but at least something.
Our logic is that if you live somewhere that isn't your parents; you pay for it (the same as us).
We tried to sit them down and have a flat discussion in a mature way and voice our concerns. However, the boyfriend and our flatmate don't agree with this at all and think that him paying bills is enough since he stays out of our way most of the time and is just paying for what he uses. We countered that by saying that by that logic, if we stopped using anything in the flat we would still have to pay rent. It's all blown up and now the boyfriend feels really unwelcome (not our intention) and has moved back home. Also, our flatmate is really upset with us and feels like we ganged up on her boyfriend.
Am I the asshole?

EDIT: to include the fact that he has had his mail delivered to the flat before and we have been requested to collect it for him"

The instructor immediately stopped what she was doing, went to her phone, turned the music down and switched the song. I was joking, but all anybody else could hear was me loudly complaining.

4gbyls,,"So I'm now a sophomore in high school and I met this guy, let's call him Bob(I'm a guy too and this is just a friend shit no fucking homo, we both have had gfs in high school), in mid freshmen year and we became good friends. I'd say as good friends as you can be w/o being best friends. We had our little group and we all hung out a lot, especially as the weather became warmer. As our sophomore year began everything was still good. Then we just stopped hanging out after school, only talked in group chats n stuff. Still good friends in school tho. Winter break comes along and we didn't talk much. We come back to school in January and suddenly Bob is acting differently. Then a few days later in lunch he was a bit of a duck, was very aggressive with his words and threw stuff. At this time I didn't think anything was wrong so I just brushed it off, no harm done bro! Then the next day he does it again. Then for another week he keeps doing this, lunch is the only time I see him in school btw. So after these 2 weeks I'm done with his shit. I fight back, and I fight dirty, literally too. There were never any fists involved but if he did something to me I did the same shit back and I'd 1 up him. He threw a grape at me? I threw 2! He then would continue with 2 as well but he would throw them after he squished them. Then this went on and on until the janitor came to pick up the lunch trays, does this every day around 30 min after lunch started this is not a special occurance. Then in February he begins to spread rumers about me, still Idk why. The ""fights"" got worse and worse. It just became the norm to do this every day. I almost punched him in the face in multiple occasions, and I'm sure vise vesa. All this continued until late February when I decided to just stop talking to him.

4gef5b,,"Okay, so, my grandma is a wonderful but slightly (extremely) paranoid person. She gets on these different kicks about different things, usually she drops it after awhile, but there's one thing she's been extremely concerned about as long as I've known her: black pepper consumption.

According to my (dear, sweet) grandma, black pepper is a major contributor in everything from high blood pressure to tooth decay. Plus, according to her she ""hates"" it.

Now, she's a really, really picky eater in general, beyond this. Although I am an extremely health-conscious cook, and actually have some professional restaurant/cooking skills, she is very rarely happy with the food I make because some flavor or texture or ingredient displeases her.

One area that has traditionally proven troublesome is my burgers. Burgers are one of the few things I can consistently get her to eat (she won't touch lamb, pork, rabbit, any unusual poultry, etc), but she always complained about my burgers ""not tasting right"" or ""not having enough flavor"". Until recently that is...

Recently my mother (her daughter-in-law) clued me in to the fact that the reason grandma always tells me she likes my mom's burgers the best of anyone in the family is because she (my mom) puts black pepper in them and doesn't tell her. At first I was astonished, but then after another round of burger complaints (I eat lunch with my grandma 1-2 times a week and I usually cook, so you can imagine how tired I get of this) I decided ""fuck it"" and put black pepper in the burgers.

Now I've been consistently just cooking with black pepper the way I normally would, and guess what, she likes EVERYTHING I cook better now! It's great to finally make her happy(-er) with my food but I kind of feel bad about lying to her about this. Am I the asshole?

**TL;DR:** AITA for feeding my grandma black pepper when she's convinced that it is bad for you, even though she likes my food way better when I leave it and say nothing?"
4gep0g,,"I was in Subway looking to get a job application and it was the middle of rush- about 9 older people were in front of me, with two kids.

The kids were just kind of lingering behind the line, and I assumed they already got their food before the older crowd (as in, they were together and paid for). Right before I went to ask the man about applications, this woman runs out of the bathroom and says ""Can you please move? We've been here a very long time, etc."" I just gave her a look and let her and her kid go.

Was I the asshole here? I didn't say anything, but I don't know why she got so mad so I'm assuming I might have been."

**tl;dr: boss left on an emergency, doesn't answering his phone when asked about when he's coming back or when we're getting paid. Work is quicksand. I'm mad. Am I the meanie pants?**


*The actual story*


I'm a 20 year old software technician. My current place of employment recently partnered with another group to teach people with mental disabilities simple programs to expand their professional and work skills. On top of learning cool stuff like web-design and 3d modeling, it opens up their work options so they can land gigs outside of stuff like maintenance and security. It's really awesome work and I enjoy teaching these guys - they're sweethearts.


Anyways, fast-forward a couple months to today. We're pretty deep in the project already. My day 1, OG students, are super advanced: they're churning out work and taking on projects and I barely have to watch them. Cool beans.


Now the good stuff. the other week my boss ended up having to skip town to check on his daughter: complete emergency situation. I'm good friends with her (and my boss actually), so I'm worried for both of them. I completely understand that he needs some time away from work to make sure she's okay and whatnot. But here's the problem:


1. He's completely gone MIA. Meaning he doesn't answer phone calls and deliberately ignores texts/whatsapps/etc. His only communicate is to tell my coworkers and I to do things.
1. His business partner, the head of the company responsible for bringing us the students to teach. Is really pushing to bring in more trainees for us.


When I mean he doesn't answer his phone..I mean he doesn't answer his phone. Ask him what he wants the students to do? Silence. Ask about how and when we're getting paid? Nothing. Ask about whe"

No one asked you to clean it up. Don't yell at me for ""not walking him like he's been trained to"" when I am following the instructions I have been given.

{Other sister} wasn't walking him in the morning. Mum takes him for a walk every morning so he can poo and Bruce usually does in the evening too

**Sister:**
Well he's meant to be walked in the morning if you were told different whatever. Doesn't fix the poo problem and I'm yelling at everyone because those poos had clearly been there for at least 5-6days and no one did anything about it and there's"
4ghpcw,,"This is a hypothetical.

Basically, I'm going to die alone so anyone being in a relationship around me is like another punch in the stomach.

I've had feelings for one of my friends for what is unfortunately 1.5 years now, and that's been hard enough without her being with anyone. Now I'm like 95% sure her and my housemate who is also one of my only close friends are going out. 

Would I be an asshole for avoiding both of them forever? Can't really see any other way around this. It's not like I'm getting over her anytime soon, so I'd rather not see them together.  It's just another constant reminder of happiness I'm never going to have. "
4gixxh,,"One of my best friends is super busy at the moment (little daughter, new job, new city), so when my birthday came up a few weeks ago, she almost forgot and just sent a text message. She felt super bad about it, even though I told her repeatedly that it was no issue and not to worry about it.

Now her birthday is coming up and I wanted to send her a little cake and a card, like I often do for friends who are a bit further away.

But now I'm thinking, if she already feels bad about my birthday... would I be a dick for possibly making her feel worse? Should I be more modest and just give her a phone call?

In general, I just have a lot more time on my hands than she has (single, no children, currently looking for a job). So there have been a few occasions where I helped her out (moving, putting up furniture in her new apartment, etc.) and she hasn't really had a chance to return the favor. I don't mind at all, but I know that she sometimes feels like a bad friend even though she really isn't.

So... what do?"
4gj5vj,,"My baby friendly colleagues know I never want children but love to test my limits. They said ""What would you do if your partner got pregnant and didn't know until it was too late to abort it?"". I said I would ""relinquish all my parental rights"".

They then said ""Would you break up with your partner if she wanted to raise your child with you?"". I immediately said yes. What's the point of staying together if we have such differing, life altering views.

""What if you had to still raise it?"" Then came the coup de grace... ""I'd prefer to kill myself rather than raise a child and ruin my life."". Don't think they quite believed me. But yeah, I'm constantly popular working with 3 heavily pro-child people!

It's just the idea of having my beliefs questioned like that. Like they're sitting there rubbing their hands together waiting for me to say ""yeah, then I'd raise a child"" and love the fact they've ""broken"" me. But no, if I indulge it then I'm the asshole. What do you think?

4gl1te,,"I haven't done anything yet, but I've recently been given a good opportunity to move out with friends.

Details of my current home life:
I live in a two bedroom house with my father who has lymphoma and his alcoholic father who can't take care of him. They both have a bedroom, and I sleep on the couch in the living room. 

For the most part, my father handles his illness very well and still lives a good life. But here and there he has really bad days and I need to take care of him. I would still be living in the same area so I could take the time to go home and help him, but I feel really guilty about potentially abandoning him.

Would I be an asshole for moving out?"

I got a bullshit ""sorry not sorry, you shouldn't have put your face in the way! Well shit, I guess I'm awake now.""

I got angry. I know it was an accident, but that has never stopped me from apologizing when I pegged someone in the fucking face! He refused, and said he doesn't feel bad. I asked to please go home. 

When we got to my place I tried one more time to explain why I was so upset. I pointed out that he has no problem apologizing when he accidentally hurts my feelings, how does he not see this is the same thing? He said that it was my own fault for ""freaking out"" about the blankets, and that I was, apparently, making something not about me all about me. I walked away.

Anyway in about late November this older dude, upper 20s if I'm not mistaken, really just started being a giant dick. Our first encounter was him approaching me to explain how I was incorrectly and how he could do it better by leaning backwards and arcing his back. Later that day I see him doing Lat Pull downs and he is doing quarter reps. So I ask him why he isn't doing the full motion, being curious due to being a novice in the gym. His reaction was to tell me to fuck off and not speak to him again. It legitimately escalated immediately to that. Eventually time passed and one day my training partner and I were doing leg press and had our water bottles next to it. Like most people, as observed and I would assume, we stand next to it when we where waiting on the other one. He comes into the gym and goes to the dead lift platform, which is next to the leg press. After a set I go to stand up and see that he is walking towards me, I assume he is going to get some weights, so I begin to walk out of the narrow aisle so I can stay out of his way. As I am do"

I don't want to get into specifics but for my entire life, my mother has been very manipulative and abusive towards me (emotionally and verbally).  When I turned 15, I went to live with my aunt and haven't seen or spoken to my mother since (I am 19 now).  I have been going to therapy for many years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.  My predicament is, I have a very good relationship with my dad which is suffering from my avoiding my mother.  My mother is very resentful of my independence and resents it when me and my dad spend time together.  My dad doesn't understand why I can't have a relationship with my mother and often tells me he wishes I could be around her to make her happier.  I don't want to lose my relationship with my dad but I just don't feel like I can confront my mother at this point in my life.

During the first round of 1v1 I informed my SO I was drinking and playing pong with Chan, and not angry with me at all she went to sleep it was getting late. So without someone to text I invited my roommate and his strictly just friends, who are females, who all know my gf and like her. We played pong got slightly more drunk and went to bed, my SO never asked me what else we did so I never thought to tell her seeing as she normally doesn't care.

This evening I got home from work to find a late-model BMW in my parking spot. I let the door man know and we had the car towed. I checked back three hours after the car was towed and he still hadn't heard of anyone looking for it.


Am I in the wrong for having him towed?


EDIT: I should clarify, I understand that I was within my rights to tow. The asshole question is whether I should have tried to leave a note and give the guy an hour or so to get his car out first. This would have likely required me to park in the building's loading zone or find a parking meter and pay a few bucks."

48wzie,,"Hi Reddit, a little over a year ago, I moved into an apartment with two friends (the two friends lived there for about a year before I came in). The apartment has two regular bedrooms and one master bedroom that's much bigger, so whoever lives there pays a larger share of rent for it. We're in the process of finding a new roommate, and my other roommate really wants the room. The problem is, he's currently a month and a half behind on rent as it is, and has no real steady income. At the moment he's an adjunct professor making barely enough to get by on the few classes he teaches (and has no work come summertime), meanwhile I have a pretty steady and larger flow of income. I think I should take the more expensive room in our apartment because of this, but he wants it and is angry that I'm even bringing up the idea of taking it. When one of us is late on rent, it looks bad on everyone, and although he says he'll be caught up on rent by next week, I just don't think his financial situation is good enough for him to be able to handle the extra money that'll come with that room. 
I should also mention that I'm the one carrying the burden of scheduling viewings of the apartment and taking pics/making posts on rental sites. He has done nothing. Reddit, AITA?"

But yesterday we were in my car after a movie and things were getting heated up. And randomly, right in the middle of us kissing she says ""I wish you were Justin Bieber.."" 


I was weirded out by the both  the randomness of the comment as well as the fact that she wasn't thinking about me while we were making out so I stopped. She tried to resume kissing but I told her I wasn't in the mood anymore. I'm still kind of annoyed and weirded out that she wishes I was someone else.

Basically, I fucking hate my life and I'm finding it harder and harder to pretend everything is fine. Occasionally, my best friend (only have 3, but even if I had 30 she probably still would be) realises I'm feeling shit and asks me what's wrong and being a moron I answer truthfully. I hate making her feel so bad, I feel like I'm constantly bringing her down, and I think she'd be happier if I was just gone from her life. 

Would I be an asshole for telling her to just let me go and to stay away from me?"
499g66,,"Let's get some context: We have a 3 bedroom apartment, and we rent the master bedroom out to a roommate. When he moved in, he agreed that he would help to clean the place; said it would  be no problem. 

The master bedroom he lives in has a bathroom. I consider it a half-bathroom and only worth the toilet, sink and storage - BUT it's technically a full bathroom with a stupid shower you can't stand up in. We told him it was cool if he used the common bathroom to shower as long as he helped clean the bathroom, and he agreed. 

The day he moved in, he insisted that he can't use the toilet in that bathroom either (it's an old building built in the 30s so it *is* awkward). We said that we could all share the common area bathroom as long as he helped out with the responsibilities. 

MONTHS LATER, ~~he hasn't cleaned anything~~ *edit: in the first 6-7 months he lived with us, he only cleaned the bathroom maybe twice. He himself admits it was ""maybe a few times"".* I clean my bathroom weekly, so we typically cleaned it about 24 times in that timeframe. We'd ask him to clean the bathroom, and then he'd leave the apartment and say he isn't home and can't clean - and he'd never clean it even after he got back. He hasn't helped buy toilet paper. He hasn't bought cleaning supplies. He hasn't taken the trash out. Nothing. We had a discussion about it and talking to him about this frustrated us to the point that he was told to just not worry about it we will deal with it ourselves. 

For the last few months he has lived here, not coming out of his room, not talking to us, not buying toilet paper or cleaning supplies or anything, and not helping to clean the bathroom. But he keep using it, and he's been in that bathroom while we had to get ready for work. 

I understand not using the shower in his bathroom, because you have to sit to use it and use a shower head on a hose - it's not great but other roommates have preferred to do that instead of share a bathroom. However, he uses the"

49hx5g,,"Hi there!

There's currently an ongoing dispute in our house as to whether we should sell our gaming console.

Around a year ago, me and three other housemates split the cost of the xbox one four ways.

Now two of the housemates have PC's and no longer use the Xbox, and are now wanting to sell it, however the other two housemates still use the Xbox regularly. 

The housemates who want to sell the Xbox feel they should be able to cash their ""Share"", this means  selling the Xbox entirely, gaining each of us around £50, however this means the two who don't want to sell have to spend an additional £50 continue owning the gaming console, and they feel as if it's unfair to pay the extra money.

The two housemates who don't want to sell feel it is fairer to sell it at the end of the year when we all move out, and then split the money as there is then no demand from anyone to use it.

49lzko,,"Gonna keep this short and sweet since this all sparked up some other bullshit drama that I don't want to bore you guys with.

My girlfriend worked in a vet for a few years and about a year ago lost one of her cats to a bladder issue (I think a tumor that caused a blockage). She noted the my brothers gfs cat, igor, is showing similar symptoms. Now this is not in any way my cat. The only connection I have to this animal (besides my overall love of animals) is that it is over at my house 4 days a week. It was showing signs of not doing well (firm, large belly, random stains appearing through out the house, pissing what smelt like pure ammonia, hiding more than it used to) and I was telling my brother all this and suggested it should go in for a check up because it could have an issue with its bladder. Even provided evidence and explanations as to why my gf and I think this.

My brother and his gf think everything is fine because he seems okay for a few hours in the morning and were straight up against the idea (even though he already had to go in for updates on shots) and when I was persistent (I kept it calm and civil)...well it just turned into a shit show that is for another post.


Also to note, if I thought my girlfriend was wrong and being paranoid, I would have told her so.

TL:DR AITA for suggesting someone else take their cat in for a check up"
49p298,,"So this is more of a hypothetical question because I don't have an issue now, but it happens every so often. 

Sometimes when my friends and I are out drinking or just chilling at home or whatever, they'll be telling me something about their personal lives. Most of the time I get the idea they just want an echo chamber, but I'm nobody's echo chamber. If you want to bitch about something, that's fine, but I'll try figure out a plan to help you. 

I take this type of thing rather seriously because I see it as a challenge that I can solve. So I'll ask a few questions, things I can't just assume. Usually this will turn into an argument because they don't agree with how I see the situation. 

When I argue with someone, I see it as something I can win. I can take being wrong, because I learn something about it, but I don't like being wrong. So I'll argue for a long time until I see no other way that I can convince them I'm right. 

My best friend has said that I have certain ""moments"" where my sort of cynical or apathetic side comes out and I say things that hurt him. These things usually come out during an argument with someone and the fact that I don't say sorry, and don't really understand why I should say sorry makes the situation worse. I don't know why I don't get it, but sometimes I just don't. I can't see why it would offend someone, because I generally take insults very well and when people speak their mind I don't think it's mean unless it's really bad. 

So when this happens, am I the asshole? I'm starting to think I am, but I need a more objective view on it."

For the duration of this quarter, whenever we're given assignments,  I have been posting them and creating formatted documents in a shared group folder for my ""small group"" to do our homework in on Google Drive. Each time we get homework, I put it up, and the group members receive invitations to edit each assignment by email. We all have access to the folder, and have editing rights to its contents. 
 One of my small group partners has been missing a ton of class and has a history of not contributing to smaller group assignments. When our last small group assignment was given, he was not in class. I posted the homework up and did my part.  I didn't put his name on the final draft, after consulting my instructor, because he made no contribution. 
I sent him an email letting him know that I was unable to turn in any work from him, and if he was going to be missing class, he should check in with one of our group or the teacher so he could get his assignments. 
I received an email back saying that he understood, but the problem was no one sent him the homework assignment with
enough time to do much,  and that he didn't know there was a group folder.
I replied back that the homework had been posted and that I had sent him an invite to edit the assignment a week ago.  I said that he may need to check his email filters or check his Drive more often, and that we could make sure that the email I have is correct-- it is-- he had contributed on some of the assignments in the shared folder, so I know he has access to it.

The videos he made so far were so poorly made and his raps didn't even flow, so I tried reasoning with him - to no avail. 
After the two days were over, he was delusional and believed that he got so many youtube views and followers, and that he was ""too good"" for everyone, and his whole social media was filled with shitposts. He was going to quit school as well because of his ""success,"" and then I finally lashed out at him and told him to ""wake the fuck up.""

Usually it doesn't bother me, but I hate it when they open it too early, when I'm still a good distance from the door. Then I feel pressured to hurry up and walk through so they don't have to stand there waiting for me. And then I feel like I should thank them for holding the door for me, but I don't want to because I never wanted them to do that in the first place, and no one is better off for it; it would have been absolutely no trouble at all for me to open it myself. And what's the rule for thanking people when they hold two doors open for you in quick succession, like when you're going through a vestibule (entryway)? Do I say ""thank you"" both times? Instead of thanking them, I want to tell them that it's unnecessary, and there's no need to do that for me in the future, but it's no use. They'll never learn because it's a different person every time. I sometimes hear people behind me thanking me when I'm just walking through, not intentionally holding the door for them, and they just happen to be close enough behind me that the door doesn't have time to close before they get to it. I want to tell them, ""No, no; I was just walking through this door because I need to get into the building. I wasn't holding it for you and there's no need to thank me."" But again it would be useless because I would have to say that over and over to every new person that thanks me for walking through a doorway. Maybe I can teach the world to stop holding doors open for me by giving it a taste of its own medicine. Should I start opening doors for people WAY too early to try to make them hurry through and feel awkward like I do?

I thought my dad might like it too so I told him about it, he thought it sounded ridiculous, but wanted to give it a shot anyway. I asked if he wanted to watch it that night and he said he would. 

(Just a quick side note, my dad is a long-distance truck driver. He is away for weeks on end, and I'm a college student that is pretty busy most days. So we barely see each other.)

Tonight rolls around and I'm talking with my long-distance SO over text. I told her I watched the movie and loved it, and started talking about how I was going to get my dad to give it a go. We talk for awhile, and she starts naming off some movies she wanted us to watch, presumably that night.

(Another side-note, nearly every night of the week we have little Netflix movie dates.) 


 I told her I already had plans to watch the movie with dad tonight, and she go really upset. I apologized but she insisted I watch the movie, saying not to talk to her for awhile. 

We did get a little choppy earlier for an unrelated reason though. She were talking about Star Wars and she had said that a certain scene was the best of the series. A bit of a pet peeve of mine is people saying that one singular thing is ""the best"" when it's subjective, so I said something. (Which, in hindsight was pretty shitty of me.) She didn't take too kindly to that. 


Besides getting a bit choppy earlier, did I get something wrong here? Like I said, we watch movies and TV shows nearly every night out of the week, we have a Skype schedule, etc. and she said that I treat her like ""something that I fit in when I can.""

There was a bit of an argument on Monday (over something my sister did that I got caught in the cross hairs of). My mother begged me to come back and I decided to because if she needs me I am going to be here. My sister could help. She lives a lot closer (a half and hour away), but isn't, despite the fact my parent do everything for her. But that is a different story for a different day.

Anyways, my mom doesn't let me help out a lot. I made dinner one night, she insisted on making dinner yesterday, and we ordered out today (I would have been happy to cook). I have my two young kids with me. They are 3 years old and almost 2 years old. My parents want the kids here because they miss them when we are gone (I live two hours away). My dad has stayed away because he doesn't want to pass them his germs and my mom insists she is better.

I am sick myself. I came down here for a doctor's appointment and my issue was not resolved. I also now have the flu my parents have. That said, I try to help out as much as I can. My husband will be helping too, when he comes down tomorrow after work.

Today, my mom takes the kids in the yard to play. I told her I wished she had run that by me before getting them excited because I had no ability to chase them around outside (you can't exactly run when you have the runs) and she says its no problem and takes them out for a half an hour with my grandma (who lives next door). When she came in I must have had a fever. I was shaking under a blanket, but I was trying to hold it together. My mom put a blanket over me and told me to put my head down for a bit.

They're in and out of jobs all the time, either because they made bad choices or they antagonized someone, or some damned thing, and they've never been able to progress far enough in their career to the point that they could make a decent living. They both recently lost their jobs again and now they're in danger of losing the house they were renting (that its self is infested with rats) and possibly losing custody of my little sister (who would likely just live with my older sister but that's not the point). While they are now making progress toward new jobs they're hardly looking for anything much better than what they already had and they're still showing signs of the behavior that cost them their past jobs.

Recently things came to a head when my older sister confronted them with basically the standard ""Be an adult and quit screwing around"" speech that most parent are meant to give to unruly children and I don't think that helped much, so I talked to them afterward and suggested they see a psychiatrist and look into therapy because a lot of what they're doing is disturbingly reminiscent of PTSD. While my dad was receptive to the idea my mom took the opportunity to ""take a walk"" and effectively shut down for the rest of the day and wallow. We let her go then thinking she just needed to blow off some steam but went looking for her after some time. We found her mumbling something about not being worth the effort and that I should have just left well enough alone. I didn't say anything then  and just tried to comfort her enough to go back home but frankly I was pissed that this was her r"

All classes are tight schedule and no one has time to talk much,including me and her,so i just talk to her friday again,she says ""i'm up for it,text me with the details"" etc... then i text her and she is like ""aight i will text you back to say if i can go out"" that already gave it away to me that we wouldn't,and that's ok but i expected her to be polite enough to say yes or no,but she didn't text at all.I thought it was rude because she had said yes first time i asked.

4anwyp,,"So I just found out my 2nd cousin died of a drug overdose last night. I am waiting for my mother to broach the topic of going to his funeral. I really don't want to go, nor do I feel like I need to go. Understand that I haven't seen or spoken to this person in over 15 years (I am in my mid 30s). I don't think I could pick him out of a police lineup today. 

Selfishly, going to his funeral would kind of be a pain in the ass. It would cost money (hotel, gas money, dog boarding), and I don't think my presence there is of any substance to anyone in his immediate family. Buuuut, I am probably going to get a guilt trip about it.

4apu7t,,Trying to get over a 2 and a half year on and off messy relationship. My ex really fucked me over and I'm finding it difficult to remain close with mutual friends of ours. I just want to move on and hearing about him all the time or not knowing where my friend's loyalty lies isn't helping.
4aq4pi,,"So I started a new job in a new state recently and as part of my office's camaraderie-building we all had to sign a sheet listing off our addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, etc. 

Now, I've always hated birthdays. In my experience they're always an excuse for other people to party for themselves, get free cake, and make a big deal about who/how many people are going. Unless it's close family it never seems to actually be about you.

I put off signing this sheet for a really long time and, not knowing what to do when the time came, I just put down a fake birthday and figured I'd make a joke about it near when it rolls around. I didn't want to have to explain to a bunch of people I just met why I don't like birthdays and make a big deal out of things.

All's fine and dandy until later that day I jokingly tell another coworker about it and she got really serious, saying I should feel terrible about the decision given that a bunch of people are going to be expecting a birthday on xx/xx/2017 when they see the sheet and they're going to bring in cake for nothing. She closed the conversation with a ""well let's hope you're still working here next year"" and I couldn't really tell whether or not that was supposed to be a joke.

I can kind of see her point but I really don't see a non-awkward way out of this and I don't like the comment she made at the end. 

Is she the asshole? Is it me? Is this all pointless? You decide!"
4aunr3,,"Last weekend, I paid $435 for a used Mac. Other similar computers were going for roughly $300 but I had reached out to two other posts and had not received prompt responses. The computer was advertised as having El Capitan OS. I go to buy the computer and the seller says that everything is in the box and says that he didn't have time to install the OS but I should be able to do that without a problem with my iCloud account. I get home and try to download the new OS and I am caught in a loop; I can't download the OS and I can't go back to the previous OS. I look in the box for the OS software disc and it's not there. I email the dude, who was selling the computer for a friend to see if he can get the disc, he says that he cannot. I am asking him to split the cost for me taking the computer into Best Buy to see if they can make an evaluation (will probably need to purchase new software). Am I the asshole or should the seller pay (at least) half the cost?"

She agreed and I went off and created a fake account to fuck with him. When the conversation began between him and I things started to heat up quickly. Of course he asked for my true identity and I simply told him that if he did it again there would be a real problem. He set a time and a place for the fight to happen. Instead of further escalating the situation I decided to ignore his last message. So AITA for causing needless bullshit?
4b24yq,,"First off, an explanation for the quotations around disrespect. The sort of official meaning for disrespect within the smash community is beating somebody while they're already down. For example, someone is knocked off the stage but can't get back on, but then the opponent jumps off and hits them further, basically overkill. However, the meaning of the word has widened significantly over time. 

Now for the actual story. I was in a smash tournament, which I won in the end. I actually played the guy who I ""disrespected"" earlier on as-well as in the finals. I knocked him into losers bracket and he got really angry and had to step out for a while. No big, this happens all the time in venues. People get really into the game. After a while we hit the finals and he has won in the losers bracket. I didn't drop a single game up until that point when he beat me. In smash brothers tournaments, we play a set with best out of X amount of games against each person. Think Tennis in a sense. We were doing Bo3 matches throughout including in GF (although many do Bo5 for finals matches). He beat me in the first finals game of the set. Then in the second game he starts out at a lead but I gimp (use a weak move to stop the opponent from coming back to the stage) him which lead to me gaining traction and winning that game. So now we are at 1-1. At this point he was already getting angry and I was getting annoyed at him for getting so angry at a game. 

In the third game, he starts off strong but I take a stock (life) off of him and he can't seem to figure my strategy out. He's playing as Cloud from Final Fantasy 7. Cloud has a special move that is essentially a charge meter you can actively charge. Once charged all the way, your stats are boosted for a while until you use another special move. In Smash Bros tournaments, if there is a time-out where the clock hits 0:00,then the person with more stocks wins the game. 

I noticed that I could run down the clock or take another stock from "

In a long distance relationship with girl 1. Girl 1 and I decide to try open relationship because we're apart for so long. Spend two months not taking advantage of open relationship. Girl 2 invites me out to a bar; we get drunk, come back to my place. Kiss a little, get kind of touchy. Girl 2 goes to bathroom, I check my phone. Girl 1 doesn't want open relationship anymore. Girl 2 comes back and we don't have sex, but make out for a while. Am I the asshole for hooking up with girl 2 when girl 1 had agreed to an open relationship for two months up until right before I was with someone else?

More Detail. all names are fake, all parties are 20-21 years old.

I've been dating Amanda (Girl 1) since summer break (about 8-9 months). We live in the same hometown, so it worked well for summer and winter break. I go to college 4 hours away from her and we recently decided to try having an open relationship because we obviously can't see each other very often. In the two month span of having an open relationship, I never did anything with any other girls for no particular reason. 

Last night, Taylor (girl 2) invited me out to a bar. I tell Amanda that I'm going out with Taylor because we still talk a lot and I keep her updated in my life. Amanda is perfectly fine with this. Taylor and I spend a few hours at the bar, we get pretty drunk and then come back to my apartment. We kiss some, get a little touchy, and then Taylor goes to the bathroom for like 5 min. 

I check my phone and Amanda has texted me saying that she really doesn't like having an open relationship and wishes for us both to be more committed. Taylor comes back and we don't have sex, but make out a lot. 

Am I the asshole for hooking up with Taylor when Amanda says she doesn't want an open relationship, as I start hooking up?

Post Asshole, Am I an Asshole for telling Amanda that I didn't do anything with Taylor because I know it would hurt her emotionally. "
4b79b0,,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 9 months now. We both plan on entering university this year, and there is a big chance of us having to do long distance during our bachelors. I want to pursue dentistry (a five year bachelors plus masters course) because it'll give us a cushy income and I wouldn't have to work as much as a doctor, giving me time to focus on my family. He wants to pursue a mechanical engineering degree (3 years bachelors) and then would like to do a masters (additional 2 years). 

The reason we might have to do long distance is because dentistry in the city we live in is very, very difficult to get in, compared to other nearby cities. I simply do not have the grades to make it in here. He says must stay here, because he can't afford to pay for his mom's rent, as well as his own if he lives somewhere else. I understand this. While I'm still part of the lower class, his family has an even lower financial status than mine.

His dad sends him money every month for their rent, even though his parents are divorced. His mom lives off of this money, as well as the government. She only works 8 hours a week because she goes to mandatory language school, and already has quit one job because the hours were too long. She has had rheumatoid arthritis for ten years. She quit another job, where she would work for 18 hours, because she didn't like her coworkers and the job didn't fit in her time schedule. You see, even with her working 18 hours, her son could have pursued an education anywhere else (not necessarily with me, of course, but to places with a better program).

His mom has to go to school for around a year, and by law is required to then pursue another job so that she wouldn't have to live off of the government forever. That means in around a year, she MUST find a better paying job to support herself, first of all, and then her son. If she doesn't, she has to pay a hefty fine.

I get that we have to do long distance for his bachelors"
4b9a78,,"Diagnosed Depressed/Generalized Anxiety. Insomnia. Eating Disorder. Alcoholism. I would categorize myself as severe. Dad believes I use it as an excuse to ""underachieve"".
Some examples of our interactions:

I live in a granny house of sorts on my parents property. I am particularly messy. Room tends to be in a state of disrepair. Periodically, I am subjected to room checks in which my mom will take a push broom to the floor and push all of my stuff outside of the room out into the open. 

Mom has a habit of calling me fat. In one particular instance growing up in front of my friends said I look fatter than my other friend who had recently lost weight.

I do not sleep well do to my disorder. My mom wakes me up most days rather than letting me wake myself up.

Dad occasionally says passive aggressive things to me about weight or messiness. Basically views my depression as laziness. Thinks my mental illness is flawed character.

Dad and mom are essentially pragmatic, emotionally unavailable people. I don't really have anyone to talk to besides my counselor who I see monthly.

I don't think I have ever heard my parents say that they were sorry in any scenario. Which would imply that they feel they have never been wrong.

I work for my parents. Every so often my mom will claim I am killing my father by working for him (depending on him financially), only to be asked the following day to do work for my father's business. I am making an effort to get a job but I have extreme social anxiety.

In my opinion I am held to the standard of someone with a healthy mind. I do make an effort to live a normal life (college classes, healthier eating habits, less drinking), but if I fall off the wagon I am treated scornfully. No allowance for frailty.

4bbavc,,"My ex and I had a extremely messy on and off, toxic relationship that brought out the worst in both of us. We are currently going no contact, and both wanting to move on. I especially have had issues with coping with our breakup, and dealing with this in a healthy way. I am trying really hard to move forward and learn from stupid mistakes I have made.

My best friend, however, keeps bringing up and talking to my ex. During the time we were dating they became really close friends. This would typically be fine, except it is really affecting me. For example, last night she posted a picture of us on instagram before going out to a party. She messaged me the next morning saying ""[Ex] liked my picture! He would of seen you looking super hot."" I know she is just trying to make me feel better, but consistent comments like these are making it really difficult for me. I have talked to her about this several times, and have even said I don't know if I can continue a friendship with her while she remains so close to him, and is always bringing him up.

It is very difficult to trust that she is not saying cruel things to him about me because she thinks it is what he wants to hear. I understand that it must be difficult for her to remain close with the both of us, but I just feel like in this circumstance, especially due to the extremely messy nature of our breakup, it is just not possible. From her perspective, I know she is trying to do the right thing by both of us, and is currently going through a tough breakup herself. AITA for wanting to cut contact and abandoning her when technically she has done nothing wrong?"
4bbgk8,,"This feels more like an /r/civ topic, but it probably goes against like 10 rules there.

Anyway, I was playing Civ 5 with 5 friends.  I was on a continent with 2 friends, 2 were together, 1 was by himself.  I started exploring and found my friend Jim as India down on a decent-sized island away from me.  He was complaining about going to war with a city state.  He's kinda new, so he was just sending in like 5 elephants (not the best way of doing it, but would work).  

I felt kinda bad watching the city state about to get pummeled, so I thought ""hey, it'd be funny if I gifted a troop to them.""  Gifting a unit instantly sends them across the map to that city state.  I sent over an archer, and Jim had to retreat.

Later on he tried a couple more times to attack the city state, and I sent troops over there again.  After a certain point I thought it'd be funny to reveal my prank, so I said something like

""Man, that city state has a lot of firepower.""

""Yeah, it's bullshit!""

""Jee wiz.  It's almost like they have a mysterious benefactor gifting them troops.""

""...""

Then I came clean and told them I'd been sending troops.  My friends call me an asshole a few times.  The city state wasn't going to murder Jim, or anything, so I wasn't doing it out of malice, but I felt kinda bad and apologized.  Jim goes quiet for like 30 turns, and suddenly I see the ""Jim has declared war on Packrat1010.""

I'm sitting there like, ""Cmon, I'm an era ahead of you, don't go to war with me.""

He says, ""It's already on!  This'll teach you to send troops to a guy I'm fighting.""

Basically, for anyone who hasn't played Civ, being an era apart is kind of a big deal competitively.  I have more production, can get units out faster, and have better units.

So I'm like, ""Alright, I guess.""  I start pumping out galleass's (basically a medieval ship that can fire cannons on land) like it's nothing.  I get 6-7 up and running in a few turns, then I start sending them to his city.  On the way there, I see "
4bdesp,,"So for general context, I live in a house with two roommates. It's fairly small, and the walls are pretty standard student housing fare (thin with little to no insulation, leading to almost any amount of noise carrying through the whole house). A few weeks ago, my roommates complained that my computer was too loud at night (completely  reasonable complaint on their part, I thought I had it quiet enough but misjudged how shitty the insulation was), so I responded by apologizing and started carefully policing the volume after they went to bed, and keeping it at the level I thought it originally had to be at earlier to keep it a reasonable volume. This only really came about because I'm a total night owl (usually going to bed around 11:30-12:00), whereas my roommates both go to bed around 10:00 on a regular night. A couple of the nights that my volume was too loud, my girlfriend was staying over, so the roommates now associate her with the loud volume, which in my opinion is unfair to her, considering that my habits are the same whether she's home or not, and I honestly try even harder to keep things quiet when she's around because I recognize the burden that having an extra person around can be, especially in a small place.

As for the specific situation that most recently occurred, this morning I had to leave my girlfriend at home while I went to school, because she is too sick to be attending classes (she currently can't talk without extreme pain, and is basically living off of throat lozenges and cough syrup). Obviously leaving her alone isn't normal or ideal, but I wasn't about to ask her to leave the house, considering if I were in her place I would be sending myself to a clinic to get checked out (she's the ""I'll just suffer until my body beats it"" type). Before class, one of the roommates sent me a text complaining that my girlfriend was home, and said that she's ""overstaying her welcome"". I responded by explaining that she was sick, and the roommate responded "
4bdqu4,,"Basically, my roommate (we share a dorm room together) invited a friend of his over to our dorm room for her spring break, which amounts to 7 days. (He did this without asking me first - basically just told me by giving me a heads up, which I was a little peeved by, but whatever.)

The issue is what happens when he leaves for class (we don't have spring break this week, only she does). I also have class obviously, so that leaves his guest in our room alone, with no key. I mentioned this potential issue to my roommate before she arrived, and he seemed unconcerned, saying she'd most likely go to a library or something when he needed to leave for class.

So this morning he left for class, and she decided to sleep in. An hour or so after my roommate left, I had to leave for class, so basically someone I've known for less than 24 hours is in my room with no supervision. 

Rationally I don't think anything bad will happen, but I can't help feel uncomfortable with the situation, and isn't it common etiquette to not leave your guest in your apartment / dorm room without also being present? "
4bfcx2,,"Okay, the current agreement that stands (since I started living here) is that I pay no extra money for living here (rent wise) like, I still pay for shared groceries around the $150 - $200 mark and help in other ways (elec bill etc..) when requested. 

It is myself, SO, and SO's Mother living here. 


I've always been tedious and on the ball with tidying up, making sure the place is clean everyday since I started being here. I even started organizing cupboards and closets for her, which she loved and thanked me a lot for.
It is because she works and has practically no time to clean for herself. 

Two days ago I lost a rather large portion of tooth. I am not sure what happened, is happening or why/ how. I can't afford a dentist at this current time. 


It has been hurting to the point of it not stopping pulsating and has sort of, become a constant dull headache. I really feel that this is as debilitating as it gets for me, due to me usually being pretty swift with keeping things clean since day z.


I have been told I must start paying now, to the tune of roughly around $100/ wk. (Would barely be able to manage) (I should also mention my SO has no control over the situation as this was OUR (SO's and I)  agreement)

Sidenote, I am studying full time at the moment, and have no license as I've never applied for one or gone through that process before.

I came home yesterday and the car that normally parks directly next to me was parked in my space. His own parking spot had another car in it. Since he didn’t have that person towed I’m assuming it was a guest of his.


I don’t know which apartment he lives in and he did not leave a note on his car letting me know where I could reach him. There was no where else to park; the visitor spaces were full and I didn’t want to park in someone else's spot only to be towed my self.


So I called the towing company. Over an hour later my neighbor still had not come down to move his vehicle and the towing company showed up. I had his car taken away. I know what I did is what I’m supposed to do in that situation but I still feel bad about it. He lives in the same building as me and parks right next to me. I’m sure he will know that it was me who had it towed.


If I had known where he lived or what his phone number was I would have of course tried to reach out to him. Now I feel like I should have come up with a better solution.

I was asked to play a game with a group of people I work with. I said yeah sure it was $40 I can put that in my budget and bought the game. At some point I realized they literally never get on not even for an hour every three or so days. Then when we finally got everyone on they decided to play on the laggiest server. I have shit internet I can't change that at all. I get 128kbps down on a good day. Needless to say I was lagging like mad. I couldn't even do anything. I asked them if they would switch servers to a less populated one. They outright refused and told me it's to get the full ""Experience"". I was angry but I said nothing other than stating which channel I switched too. I got on another character that I was leveling and I didn't press any further on the game.

So I meet up with them the next day told them that I felt like I just got a middle finger. They told me that they were doing ""quests"" already on that server. Which I called them on that and it for being complete bullshit as they were not doing them when I first jumped on that server. I stated that nothing in that game is server specific at all. They could have easily just switched channels. 

Then they asked me that ""Why are you getting so mad about this?"" (I'd like to clarify that I was not yelling, shouting, cursing, I was just talking to them.) Then they told me that I should just turn around and leave and cool down. At that point I realized that talking to them wasn't going to work so I did just that and left.

He was pretty surprised and confused and he even admitted a little hurt that he was the only person in our group to not get invited. He asked the best friend of the soon to be groom what happened and that guy asked the groom, who did not respond.

He said yes but rumors are just that, she replied by saying ""well did he get one? No? Well, there you go."" This is her referring to someone they've known for over ten years...

She went on to give a very flimsy and honestly judgmental excuse about why this guy was excluded from being invited. After hearing that this is how my friend and his bride operate these days I decided that I don't want to go anymore. People who would do that aren't people I associate with.

I suddenly was left scrambling for a place... I found 1, great!  It was only 4 days after my lease ended (best I could get / actually took a lesser place than what I'm happy with to move in quickly).  I asked my 2 available close friends if I could crash at their place for 2 nights each (made a joke about spreading out the bumming).  They both said yes, but I was rather surprised by their responses (didn't seem enthusiastic at all).

When I stayed at their places, I tried to be insanely respectful.  I bought my 1 friend a bottle of her favorite liquor, and bought the other a bottle of his favorite fancy beer.  I basically just arrived at their place to sleep on their couch at 8 PM and left by 7 AM.  It felt awkward the entire time, I thanked them both with a ""sorry if I overstayed my welcome, but thanks a lot"" text.  1 didn't respond, the other just responded with a ""no problem""

Part of me feels like maybe my friend and I are the assholes because my friend is working and making money and yet we're getting mad that he's choosing work over us. But then again he's only working because his mom tells him he has to and we can see that doing this has hurt his school and everything. By the way, he isn't the type whose going to college and working to support his family. His grandparents(who he lives with), are living on $1mil property and we live in California. He doesn't really have a need to work. Note: I know jobs are important and people need to make money which is why I feel i'm the asshole for actually being a bit pissed that he does this but at the same time he will make plans with us then not tell us he has work till it's too late."
4c17ki,,"**Preface (feel free to skip):** So I came across this reddit-post on /r/misc which looked like someone plugging their own blog-post, which is allowed on that sub, but I personally disagreed with the content which made me go see whether OP posted it on any other sub where I could see other people's opinions (the post on /r/misc got no responses except for my own).

**Abstract:** OP x-posted this blog-entry on /r/technology where it actually got some attention, and there I saw this other person giving a very biased opinion on the subject. Basically he disagreed with OP, and like I said, I also disagree on some points OP makes but for very different reasons. At first I thought the other person was just a troll, so I only gave a 2-word response (which will be linked down below), but ever since this turned into a pretty ""interesting"" 2-day discussion, getting more and more off topic but in essence what made me hold a grudge (not a personal grudge mind you) was the fact that not only were his arguments not backed up by any facts (especially in the beginning), he very much claimed them to be factual.

My coworker drives by and says ""sorry dude I forgot about you"" he is with his GF too. Anyways he drives me to take the sign back and while I am walking back to his truck I trip and twist my ankle. He asks me how I am getting home and I ask him for a ride, he says yes but the way he said it sounded like he was annoyed. Anyways he is driving and him and his GF are in the front just talking like ""we are gonna be late"" and she says ""this is way out of our way"" that makes me feel bad too.

he came from his room and asked me to quickly drive him to our dads to pick up a pair of shoes before he goes to the bus station. I said ""No problem but I have to drop you off at the corner (2 blocks west of the subway that goes to the bus station) because Im taking (little brother) to school.""
So we go to our dads, and he picks up his shoes. then he starts trying to convince me to drive him to the subway station because ""it will be so much easier"". keep in mind
the subway station is 2 blocks east, there is morning traffic and it would make our little brother late for school. His bus is in an hour, and it takes at most 20 minutes to get there from the subway station. So i stop at the corner at a red light for him to get out. I say ""ok ill stop here so you can get out"",
and he sort of snaps at me to at least grab his bag from the back seat (we are in a fiat too by the way, close quarters.). Then the light turns green and i sort of snap back ""Get out the lights green!"" So he grabs his back quickly and punches me as he leaves, calling me a selfish asshole.
This really pissed me off. So pissed I wanted to run over the biker in the bicycle lane next to me. All weekend I ran around for him.
I let him use my computer to write a paper since he forgot his charger. Did i get a thank you when i asked for it back when he was done? No, when i asked to have it back, I got a snappy ""One sec!"" as he surfed Facebook. Eventually i just grabbed my laptop out of his hands. Did i get a thankyou when he asked my to drive him to the subway to go play soccer, which is about a 20 minute drive away (on easter sunday)? No, i got complaints that I wouldn't drive him all the way to soccer, and a sales pitch on taking him all the way there instead of just to the subway.

4cl9sk,,"This situation is the center of a two year long argument between my group of friends. I just found this sub and it will have the final say. 

Two years ago i was dating a girl called Amanda, we had been together for the better part of three months. She invited me to a banquet for her sorority where it would be announced that she won their presidential election. For the record I agreed to this banquet three weeks ahead of time. 

fast forward two weeks: on Monday (the banquet was that Friday) I got a call from my Dad, He was fishing in an annual ed fish tournament. Every year I hoped that I would get a call that they had an open spot on the team. This was that call, the catch was that I had to be in Houston (a five hour drive) by Thursday night, making me miss the banquet. I said yes to my Dad immediately as this was something that I had been aching to do for years. 

As soon as I got off the phone, I went to lunch with Amanda and broke the news. She was obviously upset which is something I do feel bad about. I do not however regret going, the argument is that this is something that Amanda should never forgive me for. Which she said she did. I don't think I did anything that bad because it was something I really really cared about. 

So Reddit am I an asshole for missing something important to her and doing something important to me?

TL;DR I missed her banquet to go fishing with my dad

EDIT: thanks for weighing in everyone. From what I gather it was an asshole move but I chose the best option."
4cn67f,,"i've lived in the same 4br house for six years. i'm the master tenant, and my name is the only one on the lease.  all the bedrooms are rented out. we all pay shares related to the size of our rooms (400-600 bucks), which are all well below market value for our city. 

we have a couple common rooms, but they're almost completely furnished with my things. one is our livingroom and has a couch, some matching-ish chairs, and a couple large bookcases. the diningroom has a fairly large restaurant-style booth for eating, and a little free space next to that. 

i've never had a problem with a roommate regarding furnishings, ever, but recently a roommate who has lived here for a couple years is insisting that everyone in the house should get a quarter of the total common space to furnish and decorate as they see fit. . .

which makes sense if you're all moving into an empty house together, but what about this situation? 

i've been here for six years, and will probably be here for several more before i leave the area. most everyone who currently lives here will move well before i do. i would rather not have to sell most of my stuff just so a couple people can redecorate my house. i've told everyone that i don't plan on selling anything, and that if they had any ideas on how to rearrange furniture and/or decorate the existing free spaces (which is maybe a quarter of all the common space) as they can run it past me and we'll try to work something out. 

but that isn't good enough for the one roommate. we've discussed it several times, but she won't be happy unless i provide everyone with equal empty common space. 

everyone living there currently had moved in with all my stuff already here. no one else has any furniture to add, nor do they care. it's just the one roommate.

4vlby6,,"Ok, so last Saturday, BTS, a K-Pop group had a concert in the Philippines. The crowd was extremely toxic (on my opinion) and people were hoping to get tickets, both legal and illegal, as well as freebies.

I'm not a fan but my sister is, yet she wasn't allowed to buy a ticket. So almost half of the whole day, we went around the mall (outside the arena) trying to obtain freebies.

Every time someone would give away freebies, people will run to the person and people wouldn't care about the person giving them away, even snatching every single one selfishly (example: banners, fan art). I even seen a situation where a fan art was tear in half. And it's kind of heartbreaking, especially for the owner, to see their art getting tear apart because people want to get them for themselves.

At one point, I saw another crowd, I decided go through the back instead of going with the crowd, this time the person was giving away some photocards. Since only a few was beside me, I got the chance to grab about 5-7 copies and blocked all hands trying to grab those cards and helped the person giving them away 'escape'. Now, what I did, even explained ""to be fair with everyone"", is threw the photocards one by one into the air. Some of them where saying (""Wag n'yo naman po itapon"" translates to ""Please don't just throw them"") OR (""Kahit isa lang po"" translates to ""Just one please"") but I ignored them. I threw all of those except one to keep it for my sister.

In the end, I felt proud of myself trying to help at least those, I think, Fan Club Leaders to survive the ""carnage"" and get one of those to my sister. Yet I felt a sudden guilt that I did probably something wrong."
4vmcmi,,"I am 22 years old, male.

My dad was a verbally abusive alcoholic towards me and my mom. He never quite veered into physical with me, but he had beat on my mother several times throughout my life. I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.

My dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had ""got better."" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)

I thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to. I was able to get him to give me POA, but at this point it was too little too late with nothing but a nicely worded ""Tough shit"" from the social worker who was helping me.

I have told my mom's side of the family that I don't want to take care of him and that I, quite honestly, don't feel a shred of sympathy for him and they offer verbal support and say they don't blame me one bit. My dad's side, however, says I'm ""morally obligated"" to take care of my father regardless of how he treated me growing up (They also say he couldn't help the drinking nor the abuse since it's ""in the genes"") and that I'm a disgusting human being for not sympathizing with him for (probably) putting himself in this condition, occasionally saying if I don't I will have ""Failed my mom"".

4vp91a,,"I've been working at a restaurant now for about 3 years. I've worked night shifts since the day I started and make pretty good money for a busboy (I don't think this job is your average busboy job, we do quite a bit of work).

There is a morning server, Regina, that nobody wants to work with and for good reason. Regina works Monday to Friday and she's the only morning server. She tips WAY below what other servers tip and on top of that asks you to do half of her work. So you work twice as much and make a 5th of the money you would make working nights. In addition, we found out she had been lying to former busboys that worked with her when we found out she had been telling them that she doesn't get paid from parties (big groups that come in a couple times a week). Regina had them convinced she just did it out of the kindness of her heart apparently. We told the manager, Deb, all about this stuff so she is fully aware of what this server does. As far as I know, Deb never did anything about it.

Anyway, every busboy is either quitting or coming up with reasons as to why they can't work with Regina and eventually the owners found out about this and demanded Deb put on a busboy for morning shifts. As far as I know, Deb never told the owners why nobody wants to work with Regina. Maybe she did and the owners didn't care... I'm not sure. I'm not really sure what the situation is there.

Anyway, I come back from vacation to find out I have three morning shifts with this server. Frustrating that they'd put me on mornings when I told them multiple times I refuse to work with Regina until she starts doing her share of the work and tipping her busboys appropriately (something that hasn't happened since I started working there three years ago). Not a big deal though, right? I'm just going to call off. Come up with an excuse as to why I cannot work the mornings like all the other busboys. Wrong. Deb says to me, ""If you call off you will be fired.""

4vpuln,,"I will call this a proactive AITA request because there has been no fuss about it yet, but I fear tension on the horizon.  

In February, I was invited by a good friend to go with him on his wife's family's family summer vacation.  While many others on the trip are friends of mine as well, I am not good enough friends with any of them that I would be going if my buddy who invited me was not.  In a beach house with a max of 16, I believe the current head-count is 14.  And me, Mr. Bc43004, is the only single man and perhaps one of two non-family members.  

Anyway, knowing this would be a week's summer vacation, I knew I would not have much of a good time if I were to share a bedroom with someone who may border on total stranger.  I am a 33 year old single man who's not much interested in rooming up with another dude, a woman I'd be very unlikely to have sex with, or God forbid any of the teenage boys going on the trip who would inevitably draw dicks on my face with a sharpie on the nights I pass out drunk.  It was a standard request as part of the buying terms that I do not co-habitate.  My friend said that made sense and we made it part of the deal.

Anyway, this is a family vacation that I was invited to participate.    I really don't want anyone to have to crash on sofa-beds, but I also really don't want to share a bedroom.  Say we arrive, and as an outsider I'm outnumbered 11-3 that I should share the bedroom to prevent someone from air-mattressing, am I the asshole if I say absolutely not?  I made it clear from the get-go I would pay a premium for the single's room, though my buddy did not charge me said premium.  For that reason, I am currently receiving a hell of a bargain.  

Curious to everyone's thoughts.  

TL;DR: Going on a family vacation but it is not my family's vacation.  I do not wish to share a bedroom no matter how crowded the beach house may be because it's not what mid-30's single men with jobs do.

Edit: Well it seems as though the masses think "

Now, even with the amount of money I make, if I somehow managed to save up for a car, I would essentially be paying to go to work. The insurance will cost ~$250 a month (I'm not pulling this out my ass, my step dad called our insurance provider and they gave us that number). I make ~$250 a month. So with just the insurance, I would be barely breaking even. Now, add in the cost of the car, gas and maintenance and I'm losing money.

I tried telling them that it would put me better off financially to just quit my job instead of buy a car and keep the job. They keep bringing up these two main points, ""Having a car lets you work more so you make more money"" and ""Having a car lets you get a better job to make more money"". 

1. I don't want to sell my soul so I can have ~#$50 leftover at the end of the month. I'm taking AP classes this year, so the extra school work, plus working all the time leaves me with little free time and little money.

2. Everywhere around here pays minimum wage. I get tips at the place I work at, albeit a small amount, and have been here for ~4 months now. I'm becoming a more competent employee and my pay may be increased. I feel if anything, I will be losing money if I quit and find a new job.

I didn't speak to him before letting the landlord know that he had installed an air conditioner, mostly because I think it's unfair to the people living downstairs.  And he was fine with the message I sent.  I didn't make it come across like I was placing blame, more as an explanation of the increase usage and pointed out the heat wave we've been having.  

Original:

I just moved into this place two weeks ago, the roommate that runs the house has been here over a year.

The front door lock didn't work and we don't have locks on our bedrooms (there isn't a huge amount of crime in the area but it's not the best and someone did try to break into the neighbors house recently).  Right after I moved in he messed up the bathroom sink by taking it apart when something of his fell down the drain.

It stayed like that for over a week, so I messaged the landlord about both issues. My roommate was upset with me for not giving him the chance to get in touch and making him look negligent.  

Today I got an email from her stating that she's going to apply for a rental increase on our apartment and the basement apartment because the hydro increased by 40% this year.

My roommate installed an air conditioner in his room last year, he leaves it on at the highest setting even when he's not home.  It's over 30 Celsius in the rest of the house and he doesn't open his door to share at all, and won't unless the roommates chip in $200 each to help pay for the unit.  Basically the rent's going to be raised for 7 people to pay for his comfy room while the rest of the house is miserable.

I really like this house.  It's exactly what I'm looking for and I know my roommate isn't very invested in it.

I want to tell the landlord about the air conditioner so at the very least the people who live downstairs, who are rarely home don't "

He moved in when I was 7 (20 now) and made absolutely no effort to bond with me. I loved his friends that would come over and was infinitely more comfortable with them. I was terrified to speak to him since I only seemed to annoy him. In the next decade, he rarely said anything to me that he didn't absolutely need to, and I spend the time incredibly anxious to speak to him while also cherishing the rare moments he would play a game with me, or teach me something a it the guitar. He would give me cash for Christmas and my birthday, and nothing for any other holiday. We didn't speak to the extent that he's never said ""goodbye,"" ""good night,"" or any form of ""I love you"" at all to me.

4vx8xm,,"So, some context. I (29f) have a friend (45f) who I met back in 2007 as she hired me. I was an exemplary employee and we were friends that respected the work/boss boundary. We haven't worked for said company for years, but we stayed close since. She's seen me work my ass off during my twenties. Despite the age difference, she's never had her financial shit in order. I have ALWAYS made substantially less than her/then husband. She borrowed $40 during a time when I could barely afford to eat because she really needed it. Because of the petty amount (albeit I needed it), I didn't mention anything... until years later when she was bragging about how she pays everyone back. I just mentioned it out of principal. 

She started working for a large finance company and gained the employment by a referral. She recommended me and I was first interviewed in 2008  before the global economic crisis mandated hiring freezes on the finance sector. I didn't get the job, but in all fairness, I didn't have experience. I ended up getting into banking two years later and worked my ass up into a lending role. Back in 2014, I applied on her recommendation. This was while I had banking experience (asset), but not yet lending. I was passed in favour of a candidate that did have just a little bit more, but was told it was a very difficult position.

Sometime last year, I was doing better financially. Same friend has always been poor at managing her money (she makes about 20k more than I do, but with similar expenses). I wanted to go on  a weekend trip.. she desperately wanted to go but couldn't afford accommodation but said she'd chip in with food. I was OK with that. We went shopping for groceries and she started loading the cart excessively as though we were there for a week. I didn't moderate her because she said she'd pitch in for groceries. The entire weekend came and went, and she didn't spend a dime but took money out for activities for herself. I was perplexed, and followed up when we "
4w0mv0,,"Some background information: I'm 21M going to college and have a small, 375 square foot studio that I share with my puppy. As someone who tends to be a bit more introverted, having the space to myself is a godsend, as I can have the freedom to do whatever I want whenever I want. I also keep my apartment very clean.


The problem is, friends and visiting family members are always looking to couch surf. My mom, and many of my friends will come and stay for a night or two and do little to no housework or offer anything for me putting them up. I always spend the day after cleaning up other people's food messes and generally being in a bad mood as my personal space has been disrupted. Anytime I try to tell people that I need my space for the night with my dog I'm met with tons of excuses from: ""I'm broke and can't get a hotel,"" or ""It's not a big deal I'll just sleep on the ground."" It's intrusive and gets my dog riled up as well as messes up my schedule.


I'm at the point where I just want to tell people to grab a hotel or head back to their apartments when it gets late, but I'm not really sure about how to tell people that I no longer want guests in my already cramped apartment. 


TLDR: AITA for not wanting overnight guests in my apartment and if not how do I begin to tell people about my new rule?

We'll call him Jay. 23 y/o male. I'm 21. Our background is that we met at a bar and I impulsively moved him in at the beginning of July. We began feeling like we didn't really click, in the end, and we both came to acknowledge that. I broke us up about a week ago.

Jay went through my phone after we just had sex, and read all the text messages I made to a few different guys hours prior about how I was trying to plan how I spend my free/fun time in the long run/course of the next whenever.

I've only slept with one guy once since we broke up, and I told him that, but he asked me before storming out if fucking me was going to prevent me from sleeping with other people, despite the fact that we openly know we're not compatible with each other in many, if any aspects of a tender, nurturing relationship.

He told me he felt used, but I was the one that made the ground rules that we as free individuals can choose who we want, when we want, as long as neither of us brought them back home with us to fuck in our bed, which I hadn't done.

That was our only boundary that we agreed on.

Admittedly, I know I'm at least 50% asshole, because I'm aware that you really shouldn't sleep with your exes, especially when they're hyper emotional, but I just feel like in order to avoid being a hypocrite and breaking my own house rules, to take him when we're both needy.

4wbtlo,,"*Wife: My Dad said this in an email today, “I just found out that T-Day is at Heather's this year...maybe you could think of flying out for a couple of days? SW into Sac and I pick you up heading to Chico overnight, back down to Heather's...I don't the rest of the plan. I would help with the ticket cost. Something to think about.”
*Me: No Cowboys game?
*Wife: I think maybe the reason why he is suggesting the trip is because of my grandparent’s age. I know that was the wrong use of that apostrophe, but I couldn’t decide what was the right thing.
*Me: OK.
*Wife:I don’t know. What do you think?
*Me: I dunno. I kinda wanted to go to the Cowboys game.
*Wife: I just thought that the reason why we were going was because we couldn’t afford to spend time with our families.
*Me: Well, I had it in my mind that we were going to go to the Cowboys game, that’s what I started looking forward to.
*Wife: Alright, then.
*Me: Did you already look at flights prices for those days?
*Wife: I looked, but I don’t want to do something that you don’t want to do.
*Me: Well, I think there needs to be a little more discussion than my just saying that I kinda wanted to go to the Cowboys game. And I don’t know how much your dad would be willing to chip in, but $800 for flights is pretty expensive.
*Wife: You just sounded pretty set on the game.
*Me: Well, that has been the plan for the past three months, so of course that’s what I would be set on.
*Wife: I just thought the prospect was nice...and you didn’t say anything really encouraging. I just don’t really know what else I’m supposed to take from that.

4wfid8,,"I think that if a bathroom has a locking door and one toilet whether your genitals/triangle dress silhouette/tacky euphemism for gender match the placard on the door is moot, as long as you don't pee on the seat.

But the other day I walked up to a set of bathrooms at a rest stop, found the men's room occupied, promptly handled my business in the ladies room and walked out of the bathroom to a newly formed line of women who all shot me death glares. One even sneered at me and said ""Oh, very nice"".

4wjm3x,,"My mother texted me the other day asking if I would buy my two nieces (ages 4 and 5) clothes and shoes for school. I work in a discount store that sells clothes and things at a good price, so I'm guessing that's why my mom asked. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with this, but my sister didn't even ask directly. 

Not only that, but about 3 weeks ago my sister asked me for $75 to get into her apartment. I agreed to give her $50 as I couldn't afford the $75. She texted me about this around 10 or so at night. She wanted me to try and bring the money to her that night or that morning. I don't drive. The bus ride over there is about 2 hours. 

I don't recall the reason she couldn't come and get the money, but my mom ended up getting it. Anyway, she assured me she'd pay me back the following week. That week passed, and I didn't hear from her. It wasn't until earlier this week that she texted me. She said she didn't forget and offered me a $20 target gift card. I like target, so I said I'd take the gift card and she can give me the rest in cash. She didn't respond to that text, and I haven't heard from her since.

I think it's important to note that I am the only member of my family who doesn't drive or have a car. Everyone expects me to come to them. It's a 20 min drive vs a 2 hour bus/train ride. 

I know having just moved my sister probably doesn't have money to get the things my nieces' need for school. I certainly don't want them to be without. However, I can't keep going out of my way for people, even family, when they don't do the same for me, especially when I wasn't even asked directly. AITA?"
4wv503,,"So at the time I was a junior in highschool (16 years old) and a girl I was good friends with and liked at the time was a freshman (14). We were at Homecoming, a school dance, and if you don't know a popular ""dance"" is grinding at these events.  
  
So this was my first ever dance going to in my 3 years at highschool other than one other formal, so I wasn't sure what to expect, other than this one dance grinding that most people do. I had asked a different friend how exactly people approach another and how they go about it, and he was rather blunt and said you simply go up to a girl and start grinding... Clearly wrong, but everything I could find online about the dance wasn't very helpful either.  
  
So at the start of the night I meet up with a different girl friend and she ends up grinding on me during the dance, I obviously had no intention of not letting it happen, but there was no verbal ""consent"" I suppose. Nor did there really seem to be any from what I could tell with others.  
  
So now to the actual event where I question whether I'm an asshole:  
  
I meet up with my freshman friend and we dance a little, not grinding, only in front of each other. Then she starts dancing in front of me with her back facing me, and of course her ass facing in front of me as she backs in closer towards me, not touching me. Now from I had previously encountered and saw, this was in my mind clearly a que for me to start grinding? Well I put my hands on her hips and start grinding for a second when she turns around and says ""Sorry!"" to which I respond saying ""Sorry"" profusely. We end not meeting each other or dancing again that night and I leave shortly after feeling stupid and embarrassed.  
  
I can see being either accused of sexual assault or simply mistaking a social que or anything inbetween, but I wanted to know what others thought."
4wwlgb,,"TLDR: Electrician gave expectation over the phone, provided another. My mother said something she shouldn't have to electrician. Electrician calls and yells at me. Does not give me opportunity to explain the situation. I eventually yell back and leave a bunch of nasty reviews and call them out on their irrational unprofessional behavior. I still feel shitty about it and wonder if I did something wrong.

-------------------------

It's a long explanation. I'm agonizing over this and it's pretty complicated to me. At this point I have a fleeting concern that an angry, emotionally unstable electrician is going to come and burn my house down or something irrational.

I call a 24 hour electrician late at night to help with a concerning power issue in my home (partial power outage to half my house). My wife and I both work, we have two young kids, one of the grandparents will come over and watch the kids during the day. I live in a small town and our choices of service providers is pretty limited.

Electrician guides me through some troubleshooting over the phone at about 9:30 PM and believes it may be an issue for the power company and that the power company will do it for free. However the power company may not respond quickly enough and they'd be willing to come out at 7:30 AM the next day to check it out. They'd charge $75-$90. I accept as I can't really risk not having power in my home for a few days by dragging my feet.

They come out, my mother is at my home as I told them. They indeed identify the issue as something for the power company to resolve and facilitate getting them to come out, etc. So far I've had an excellent experience with this company.

They tell my mother it was $150. I didn't tell my mother how much to expect, but my mother is scrutinizing and asks why it's so much when all they did was check my meter and tell us it's not a problem for them to fix. My mother claims they tell her it's because they sent two technicians out, and that she only ever s"
4wy2hx,,"Reservation made almost a year ago. But its basic procedure here and in most of Hotels to have a little down payment.  This person made a reservation and my employee took long to notice in our system that in fact, although he knew (was informed) of the procedure, he didn't make any payment.

When remembered about it he wrote a short message: ""Not paying the down payment. When i get there ill pay in full"".

Its not how it works. But instead of insisting (I have to deal with hundreds of issues everyday) so i just canceled his pending reservation.

Now he came trying to make another reservation. The thing is that last year it was half the price (cause it was a reservation for the NEXT year). Now he has to pay double (No discount - cause its for this week).

He wanted me to make another reservation for him. That he would pay down payment right away.

That's fine with me.

But he wants the prices that he had before (last year prices).  I'm not doing that.

4wyf4t,,"Alright so this is kind of a two parter. First part was last year. I'm living in an apartment complex where me and my buddies have essentially taken over the whole thing. Only a couple apartments in the building don't belong to us. Anyway we're loud and rowdy pretty much all the time but we've learned to get along with the few neighbors who aren't a part of our group. They have our numbers (well, not mine, but others who are in charge) and will call if there is a problem.

So with this in mind I played music fairly loud last year while in my apartment. Not loud enough for my roommate who lived right next door to complain (he has bad hearing though) but pretty loud. And pretty late at night. Never gave much thought to it. And I had a big wooden stick to hit the ceiling with if my buddy up there was being too loud and he would do the same to me.

So the end of the year rolls around and my roommate tells me he talked to the guy living below me who said he had been bothered all year by the music coming from above him (coming from me). Well shit I felt like a bit of an asshole but then I thought why the hell didn't he ever say anything? Or hit his ceiling to let me know? I would have turned it down no problem. Even worse (I almost didn't want to include this) he's a fucking grad student in medical school, which I know is incredibly hard work and sleep is very important for someone doing that sort of thing. Also the school I'm at is notorious for nerdy introverts who avoid conflict. I find this all out only like a week before I move out of the place.

Second part is right now. New apartment. Started to play music but then thought of that poor fucking grad student. Was thinking of going down and just like asking the neighbors to let me know if I'm being too loud? This is kind of a bad neighborhood so I don't know if I'm gonna come off as a creep or something. I also have no fucking clue what the acoustics in this place are like if they can even hear me. So what's the proto"

4x15ev,,"Is it wrong of me to feel frustrated with my bf of 3 years for having gi issues and at him for refusing to get help? He is 10 years older than me (I'm in my late 20s so dont worry about me being underage, lol) and has been having health problems even before we've gone out. It's never bothered me before but lately I just feel like his health issues affect our life together.

For example we plan dates (dinners, hikes, movies, outings with friends and etc) &amp; vacations but they ALWAYS get postponed or even cancelled indefinitely because my bf gets stomach cramps and the shits. It's been bad enough that he even calls in sick to work and just stays at home resting and has to be near the washroom.

Normally occurs when he eats something (ex. Too spicy, fast food, too greasy, too much dairy, etc). I have been for the past year, suggesting he should just stop or avoid eating those and take probiotics and to go see a doctor to see if he has something like an ulcer or ibs or just a sensitive gi system or something else, as it occurs even if he eats just the smallest amount of the food BUT he REFUSES TO SEE A DOCTOR or AT LEAST TRY NOT EATING THE POSSIBLE FOOD THAT MAY AFFECT HIM!!!

I get so frustrated because I can't stand it when he's in pain but I also can't stand having to drop everything planned (whether if its for us, with friends or family) just to stay and help him. I've seriously considered breaking it off with him because if he does not care to try anything to help himself why should I be wasting my time trying to help him if its a futile cause. He'd get over these gi episodes but it will occur again in a cycle and each time he will refuse to get medical help. I'm not the only who tells him to see a doctor, his family, friends and even employer/employees have all talked to him about it.

I just can't deal with the fact that I may be ""nursing"" him to health everytime something happens and cancel plans for the rest of my life. I feel like its the same as if I am ta"

I compared his attitude to racism and he said I was being subjective and PC. Am I the asshole for calling him out and making the comparison?"
4x88g2,,"I've been working for this very small company for a little over a year. There are a total of less than thirty people in the company, most of them minimum wage. I've been here longer than everyone except maybe two or three employees.

 When i was hired, i was told payday was on saturday, but payroll goes in on monday. When i got direct deposit, my checks started arriving on Thursday. I asked my boss (at the time) about it, and she said it just works that way sometimes. Naturally, over the course of the last year or so, i got used to payday being on thursday.

This week, for stupid and unimportant reasons, I'm rather extremely strapped for cash. So i penny pinched on groceries, and I'm basically living on grilled cheese until payday. Thursday rolls around, and i check my account - still broke as fuck. No pretty paycheck to ease my troubles. I asked my boss, and he said payday is saturday, you should count yourself lucky that you've been getting paid early, and you can't be upset because you didn't get paid early. As long as the check drops on Saturday or earlier, i have no right to be upset.

This has happened a couple times now (i would say four or five weeks out of the last year-ish), and i get the same answer every time. I'm upset because i feel like my boss doesn't care that most, if not all, of his employees live paycheck to paycheck and need a consistent money stream to get by.

I also know it may not be his fault that the pay is late. But it might be. If payroll goes in late, paychecks come out late. I'm honestly not sure who's at fault. A few of the employees have asked to be notified if our checks are expected to be late, and that hasn't happened either.

Tl;dr: 'payday' is saturday, but my direct deposit hits thursday. Paycheck doesn't come in on thursday, ask boss about it, boss says 'tough titty, you can't complain unless it's after saturday.' AITA?"
4xel5f,,"About 3 years ago I was laid off from my job, I had worked there for 9 years and had a good relationship with my boss (Dave), I learned a lot from that job, he came to my wedding, etc.

After being laid off I found a new full-time job that I really like, however Dave has contacted me several times over the years asking me to do work for him. For awhile I was a little short on money so I took the work on a contract basis to make ends meet, while making it clear to him that my primary job takes priority. Problem is, as a full-time employee I made a decent wage at my old job, though I didn't really get many raises over the 9 years so by the end it was just an ""okay"" wage. However, as a contractor, there is no way in hell I would accept that little. I could easily charge three times the amount for any other client if that's the type of work I wanted to do, but he only offers to pay me my old wage per hour. And when he offers for me to do half an hour of work here and there, it's honestly not worth the time taken to create the invoices.

Dave reached out again recently and asked if I'd do more work for him and I declined, and let him know that work has gotten more busy and my schedule has changed so I would no longer be able to help. I am also dealing with some anxiety issues lately and am feeling overwhelmed without the added work and pressure.

Dave emailed me again twice in the last two weeks asking for help again, this time desperate, using words like ""YIKES URGENT HELP"" and asking me to instead train him, a mostly computer illiterate person on how to do something very technical. There's just no way. I have ignored both emails, but I know he really has no other options at this point.

So... am I the asshole for ignoring him?


**Edit**: One thing to add about why I chose to ignore the emails rather than decline again. I know that if I respond and tell him no, he will continue to email me and try to ""bargain"" and pressure me into doing something for him. There is just"
4xirt8,,"I have liked a friend of a friend for a pretty long time, let's call him John, but I know John is not interested. There were quite a few awkward moments in the past because of this. We don't talk often. However, our last few interactions were pretty smooth considering the awkward past, except recently, I needed help with something only a few number of people I know could help me with. John was one of them. After asking the others who could not help me, I asked my friend for John's number. I'm going to admit that I was happy to have an excuse to talk to him but quite keen on not flirting in anyway, since I know he isn't interested.
My friend told me that he told John about me needing his help for this specific thing and he said John replied with 'no.' John doesn't want me to have his number.

I kinda got pissed at this, cause I did not think getting his number was a big deal, but now I'm considering that maybe the past still is awkward for John, I should not have asked, maybe I misread the situation, or maybe I don't know the whole story. Did I have the right to be pissed? I was going to talk to John about this straightforwardly but am reconsidering that decision and unsure how the next interaction with him will go. Should I pretend it's no big deal? Am I the asshole for not considering his feelings as to asking for his number?"
4xklbf,,"I have social anxiety, and general anxiety. I'm also unemployed and living on disability for severe hearing loss. Don't even know what's normal anymore, which is why I'm coming here. I live on my own, a 30 minute drive from my sister's place and an hours drive from my parent's. I have been too ashamed to tell them about my anxiety,  but I HAVE asked for as much notice as they  can possibly give me when they want to see me.

My family is the champion of last minute plans it seems. My sister has a 7 month old puppy, I agreed to go to her place to let her out and play with her a bit when my sister/husband in law work the same shift. My sister texts me anywhere from 1-4 times a week asking me to check on the puppy. She always texts me between 7 and 9 pm the night before she wants me to go over (usually around noon).

My parents text me once or twice a week asking me to come for dinner. They text me between 10am and 3pm the same day they want me to come over.

I understand that I'm unemployed and have free time, but I feel like it would be nice to have 24 hours notice or so when people want my time. My sister at least asks me the night before, which still doesn't feel like enough notice,  but my parents expect me to basically drop everything and go running out the door the moment they text.

I fight  off anxiety attacks every time I have to leave my apartment. If I know I'm going out a day or more in advance,  it seems to be easier to fight off the anxiety attacks. I love my family  dearly,  but resent them for expecting me to always be available at a moment's notice.

Am I the asshole for hating last minute plans, or do normal people do this all the time? I really can't tell if it's my anxiety causing me to resent them for never giving me adequate notice, or if this is adequate notice for normal people."
4xmp4p,,"Hello everyone. I am 16 years old, and I recently got a part-time job as a waitress. I've been working for a bit more than a month (four weeks). My parents says that they are proud of me and  that they are happy that I have it. 

My family has a beach house where my parents occasionally spend the weekend. My mom said in the beginning of the summer that they will not be going every weekend, only once or twice (this is important later). I almost always work the weekends, so I am not able to join them. Note that I am too young to drive, so my mom would drive me to work. 

The first weekend that I worked, I asked my mom to stay home to drive me, because I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong. That went fine, there were no issues. 

The next weekend, my parents were away, so I didn't have a ride. This is when it gets a bit nasty. My mom and I had a huge argument about me being ungrateful for her driving. (Not in a verbal sense. She said that I thank her enough vocally, but that I still don't mentally appreciate how she goes out of her way to drive me to places. I was kind of confused, but this isn't what the post is about). 

She was especially mad that I didn't sort out the driving situation myself. My thought process was that she normally drives me, so she would be the one to sort it out when she was away. I realize that I shouldn't have just assumed this, and I think I was the asshole in that situation, but this post isn't about that. In the end, I took the bus, as per her suggestion. (This was quite inconvenient, as it ran late and made me late for work, and I had to walk home, which is quite far away). 

The day of the argument, I heard her talking about me on the phone with my dad, and she called me a mean person with no respect for other people. This is when it hit me that I made a mistake. I apologized for the incident as soon as I was able to stop crying. This really hurt me, and I kind of became a mess for a few days. I didn't really talk, and I wrote a suici"
4xo8mq,,"              Last night (as of this post), my girlfriend of six years (22) and I (M/23) were getting ready for bed when she was bringing up buying herself a used car. She looked at me and said ""Will you help me buy a car?"" I said ""How?"" She replied, ""Just help pay for it."" ""How much?"" I asked. ""All of it.""

             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong. We fight almost all of the time. In fact, almost all of our fights end with her threatening to leave, so because she does this often, I usually reply with ""Fine, go ahead,"" or something along those lines. I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, ""Babe, you know I can't give you all of it."" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, ""Yeah, I know,"" but instead she asks, ""Why not?""

          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, ""Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little."" ""What do YOU need it for?"" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. ""I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all."" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, ""I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.""

            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, ""Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked o"

When I'm all packed up and ready to go with my 1200$ PC and PS4 (this is important for later) he says that he's going to go paintballing on Sunday (today) and if I want to come along, I really don't want to this weekend, maybe next weekend I say. He's fine with that but is still going to go this weekend with the other friend with us (we'll call him C), since we're taking his car down there (my car is getting fixed right now so I can't just follow him) we decide we'll just wing it tomorrow and find a way to get me home. We arrive, have a great night playing No Man's Sky and see Sausage Party and end up deciding that I'll ask my mom to meet me about halfway to our home the next morning before my friends go to paintball, she agrees, my friends agree.

Next morning L says that he wants to get to paintball around 10:30 (right as it opens) and play till 4 (when it closes), and have enough time to make a stop before he gets to paintball. I tell him that probably won't happen since my mom is going to church at 9 this morning, won't be out till 10 and she won't arrive at our meeting place until at least 10:15, meaning it's going to be at the earliest 11 before he can get to paintball. Well this obviously is to big of a demand for me to make and he starts ranting about how ""YOU KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO PLAY PAINTBALL TODAY AND YOU STILL CAME DOWN HERE WITHOUT A WAY TO GET BACK."" But we agreed that we'd make sure I got home, I'm just asking him to slightly inconvenience himself for me. But that is a big deal according to him, so what he wants to do is drop me off at our meeting place (a slightly shady gas station) and just leave me there with around 2000$ worth of electronics with me and just have me wait there for about 30 minutes until my mom gets there.

This is mainly in the case of safety violations, and to an extent I can imagine his issues (I know that safety was not as much of a concern when he was my age, and I can imagine its not easy having someone less than half your age be your boss). 

The other day he completely blocked a fire extinguisher, a huge OSHA violation.  When I brought it to his attention his response was ""if there is a fire I'm just going to run out of the building"" and then he drove off.  This is a typical response from him and I have yet to do anything serious about it.

So I took him aside and told him he needs to work with me, ""I can't keep letting this stuff slide"". He got upset and told me that if I can't take a joke then ""fuck me"". 

So I sent him home.  Now I feel awful lol.

Next day he comes in I ask him how he's doing he says none of my business basically just being salty, and I ask him if he's an asshole to everyone or just me, he replies just you. I then take the beer off the counter and tell him to leave the store."
4xslyd,,"Alright, so last night me and my 4 friends went to go see Sausage fest, all of us are 16 and with the movie being rated R if you are not 17 an adult has to buy the tickets for you. 



We forgot about this rule and so when we walked up to buy the tickets I said


""5 for Sausage Fest please!""


The manager who was selling tickets looks at me and says ""Nah"". It wasn't in a joking voice it was very short sounded and very rude. My friends started laughing and I was in shock and I said ""Excuse me?"" He replied by saying that ""I need to pay attention and read the age limit sign"" 


Whatever I thought, we got one of my friends parents to buy an extra ticket and watch the movie with us. When we went back to the line he wasn't there so we bought the ticket and we went in. As soon as we got in my friends mom said that she had to go to the bathroom real quick and so we bought food while she was in the bathroom. The manager then came out of his office and walked over to us in the line and this is where we decided that the guy was just an absolute douche, the conversation went like this 


Him: So, what are you guys seeing again?

Us: Sausage fest

Him: What part of 17 or older do you not get?

Us: We brought a parent with us dude...

He then makes us wait and when she comes out he asks her a bunch of questions about if she is staying and how old she was. So we finally get into the theatre and what do you know, there he is coming inside and where does he sit? Why the row behind us of course!  We just watch the movie and about halfway through he leaves. When it finished we go outside and again he tells us to ""Read the signs next time and that we should really pay attention to things"" 


At this point I got so fucking fed up with this dude I said 


""Dude what the absolute fuck is wrong with you?, you literally will not leave us alone. You were an ass to us when we tried to buy the tickets and then you interrogated us as we bought food and hell dude you even went into the theatre o"
4xssp4,,"Today my friend and I were shopping in town. It was really early in the morning, because there was a special sale. At the parking meter I asked her if we could go back to her car for a second, so I could put the key chain that was bulging out of my pocket in my bag (in the trunk). I think she didn't really want to go back, because she said: ""Why don't you just put them in my bag?"" Now I said that probably wasn't a good idea because I'd forget them, but I did it anyway. She said she would help me remember.

When she dropped me off at my house, of course I did forget my keys and I only realised it after she had already driven away. Noone was home and being locked out with two heavy bags I felt pretty hopeless. When she finally aswered her phone she was already home. 

I asked her if she would please bring me my keys and that I would pay for the gas. She said that she didn't want to because she was tired and that I should come to her. The thing is that with her car it's about a 15 minute drive to my house. Having to walk to the station with my bags and using public transport to get to her house cost me about 1.5 hours (and 1.5 back). (We both live in small villages.)

I know it probably isn't fair because it's my own fault I forgot my keys, but I can't help feeling a little pissed off. Does that make me an asshole?

4xu9nq,,"If more of a question of if it was justified. If any of you reading have played shadowrun you will know how cyber and bioware works then you can skip the next paragraph, those who haven't played or need a refresher read on, and strap in, it's gonna be a bit of a read.

So in the grimdark cyberpunk future there is both magic and technology, but they tend not to mix very well. Every character has 6 essence, it's basicly your soul and the less you have the less ""human"" you are. (there are fantasy races and such in shadowrun put they are an extension of human so everyone is called a metahuman) What this means for the average person is you start the lose emotions and become more cold and logical in your actions. What this means for a Shadowrunner (one of the player characters) is how much bad ass cybernetics or biological modification (Cyberware and Bioware respectively) you can cram on to your character. For non mundane (aka magical/awakened) characters this is how effective your magic is and if you lose essance you lose magic, you can get it more of it to make up for the loss through exp, known as karma in this system, but most magic users only get very little and only if nessisary. Now you don't lose 1 ESS per piece of 'ware it depends on how invasive it is, replacing an eye takes very little, but replacing your entire nervous system takes a lot, and better grades of 'ware use less ESS as well. I think that covers the basics.

**Experienced shadowruners start reading again**

So the homebrew rule was as follows: Characters must stay above one essance"" normally you have to stay above zero. Now this may not sound too bad but, that's about 15% of your potential for advancement gone as a mundane character, and the ablility to spend essance like that is a mundane's only real advantage, but my big issue was that he didn't put up anything to offset it. It's like in D&amp;D where fighters don't get anything special but they get a metric assload of extra feats and then you tak"

My dad recently sold my F150 that I loved and got me a ford focus. The car is great on mileage and everything, but the passenger door is broke and won't close fully and the car's license plate is not installed. I have to reach out and hold it shut on turns I make. He made a profit on my F150, so today I asked him to fix it and he had me put a cord thingy around it and it still opens when turning. I asked him again today and he acted like an asshole in my eyes by yelling at me to fix it or take the bus when he makes over 100k a year so I know he could easily have it done. He even sat there on the couch watching tv while my sister blew out her candles. I'm starting to feel ungrateful, but I feel like if I were in his shoes i'd gladly fix the car or pay someone to if Is old my son's favorite car for a profit. He bought my other sister a new car back in 2012, yet he can't even make my car drive able. I never ask him for anything and I don't mean to sound ungrateful but is he the asshole, or am I? 
Edit: Forgot to add that he also has given over 100k to people on bad investments. He blames his family for his dumb ass investments instead of the people he lent the money."
4y5uxk,,"So a little backstory. I work in an independent retail pharmacy with less than 20 employees and we recently had 2 people quit. I have an almost 2 year old and am pregnant with my second. My manager called me this morning to see if I could come in 2 hours early (I was working a short shift and going in early makes it a full shift) so that she can get her office work done before they start conducting  interviews for new employees. This manager is not the person who makes the schedules. I am also working 6 days straight this week as I had to have a day off for an appointment with a specialist that was 4 cities away (luckily it was easy to get to on public transit as I do not drive). My husband is a stay at home dad and got mad at me for agreeing to go in early as it ""takes away time to spend with the family"". I am the breadwinner but I don't make a lot of money and rent is high,  so in my view not only are more hours better so we have more money but it will also work out better to have more averaged hours before I start maternity leave. Am I the asshole for going to work when they need me? He feels they should call someone else,  but there's not really anyone else to call, plus by going  in they will be finding more people to work so I won't have to go in early again later when I am further along in my pregnancy.

4ya7mq,,"My mom and dad talk constantly when they are home. The both get off around 5 and talk non stop til 10 or 11 at night. They have a very healthy relationship so it's never arguing, it's typically work related, my mom sharing opinions on situations dealing with her job and my dad sharing his opinions on theses situations. I typically don't have questions, but when I do, I stand or hangout around them until they are done talking. Realistically I could be there up to 10 minutes before they decide to answer a simple question like whether or not I'm okay to shower (my parents take showers first, it's just how we do things.) recently I've been walking in their room, waiting until there is a slight break (transition in person who talks) in the conversation and interject ""hey can I shower?"".  Now I know my parents well enough to tell when there is a serious conversation, and I'd say I am very accurate at determining that. I'd never interject while they are both serious about a topic. It's usually a ""oh let me tell you what Justin said"" conversation. I just wonder if I'm the asshole for interjecting in conversations. Do you guys have this issue too? I mean it's like if I don't interject I could be waiting a while, and then I feel like more of an ass for making them say ""what? why are you just standing there?"". 

Edit: they have never acknowledged my rudeness, they just answer and continue. But I still feel rude for doing it. "

4ye9h3,,"I'm twenty and I'm living at my dad's house for the summer until I go back to school. This summer my dad's been asking me to mow the lawn. So far I've done it, no questions asked and for free.

Yesterday I came back from my 8 hour shift that starts at 6am. I work outside all day as a glorified garbage man at the beach. Naturally, I'm exhausted from my shift. So then my dad asks me to mow the lawn to which I reply no. (He was kinda busting my balls so that's why I was so blunt. It wasn't as bad irl) I told him I would do it on my day off (this Sunday).

Today I worked the same shift. Get home exhausted again and my dad asks me to mow the lawn. Again I say no, I'll do it on my day off. He got mad about it today, called me unbelievable and walked away.

I don't have a problem mowing the lawn, I kinda see it as rent. I just think he should be more reasonable about the time frame. He says it should've been done two weeks ago but he didn't ask until yesterday.

Anyway, am I an asshole?"

4yg17j,,"My husband and I paid for my son's expensive smartphone a year ago. He is a college student who just finished his junior year. This summer instead of working at a local store - where he's worked every summer and break during college, he went to another state and worked for a couple of months. He came home with a month left before he goes back to college and while he can work at the store for a month doesn't want to. On his way home from out of state he dropped his phone in water and it appears to be unfixable. I think he should pay for his own phone if he wants to replace it. He thinks we should pay since he needs it and is still in college. I think he should use the money he earned, or even better , go make some more. He CAN work at the store even if it's for a month. AITA for not wanting to spend a cent on a new phone for him?

Edit: thank you for the feedback and confirming my view!! It's on him. I think that by the time he leaves to school, he'll buy one himself because he totally relies on it for his social life. "
4yh519,,"Okay, so this is kinda convoluted so bear with me.

My best friend (Kelly) confided in me that our other friend (Anne) was in an abusive relationship. One day, the three of us got talking and Anne mentioned she had plans to run away with said abusive boyfriend. I expressed my concerns about this, stating that I care about her and this wasn't a good position for her to put herself in. Both Anne and Kelly got mad at me but Kelly was even more mad because she was the one who told me about Anne's situation, not Anne herself. 

Kelly ended up telling my boyfriend, Trent, about the situation and he asked me about it. I told him that I would deal with it and I was wanting to talk to Anne alone and explain where I was coming from. I asked him to let me handle it, because it's not his place. 

Trent ended up texting Anne anyway, which resulted in Anne being even more pissed at me. I told him I wanted to see the conversation, because I feel I should know what he said about me, and what upset Anne even more than what I had done. Trent  basically said that it wasn't my business, even though I think it sort of is. I told him again that I would like to know what he'd said and he responded with, 

""Is there anything else you'd like to know, perhaps my bank information or my social security number?""

I told him to fuck himself because that was super hostile and (in my, possibly wrong, opinion) uncalled for.

My questions for reddit are basically 

1. Am I an asshole for expressing concern for a friend based on information I technically wasn't supposed to know?

2. Am I an asshole for wanting to know exactly what he said to upset her further, especially since it involves his personal interpretation of my words and intentions?

3. Am I an asshole for reacting to what I thought was blatant rudenes with more rudeness?


 Thanks reddit!



Edit: a word "
4yma6o,,"This is probably going to be rather emotional but I'll try my best to not make it onesided. Here's my backstory on this whole mess, for context. Tl;dr at the end of the backstory.

I've lived alternatively between my mom and stepdad, and my dad and stepmom for my whole life. I'm currently 19, living at home to save up money before I move out this fall.

Ever since I was about 9, my stepdad and I have had issues. Before me, he was very hostile toward my older sister, who was a young teen at the time. I vividly remember him getting in her face, absolutely screaming, before slamming her laptop down, bruising her fingers. This was a regular thing, he would get in our faces and just scream at us frequently.

We chose to live with my mom more often because my dad and stepmother were alcoholics who hardly had food for us. So some screaming seemed okay in exchange for regular food.

When I turned a bit older, about 13, I was dealing with a lot of depression and an undiagnosed personality disorder, so at 13 I tried to kill myself. We were supposed to visit my stepdad's family the next day(it was around christmas time) and when I woke after my failed attempt, I just locked my door and refused to go to the family event. My family didn't know what I'd attempted. They came in and we argued for a while before my stepdad forcefully grabbed me and dragged me through the house and threw me into his car. It doesn't seem like a big event but I still haven't fully gotten over it. I think it's the main reason I'm terrified of large men to this day.

During the argument I revealed what I'd tried, so after my stepdad threw me into his car my mom said her and I were staying home, and that she was taking me to a mental hospital.

So my stepdad leaves, my mom goes into my room to throw away sharp objects as the mental hospital employee told her. I called 911 while she did this and told the local police officer I was transferred to that I didn't feel safe in my home, and told her about my ste"
4ymdyk,,"Long story short, I wronged an ex-friend of mine a long time ago over a sleeping with a guy I didn't know she was interested in before she and my friend moved away, which I desperately apologized for (even though I'm certain she was wrong, she denies it being important anymore but still thinks I'm a negative influence in her life.) So this ex-friend and another friend live in an apartment together with 2 other people, and I let my friend borrow $300 to afford rent after she quit her job over a coworker sexually harassing her. Fast forward 3 months from then, I'm supposed to visit my friend (I live in another state) and my ex-friend thinks I'm too ""untrustworthy"" and that I'll sabotage her life and she doesn't want me to go through her stuff while she's gone that weekend... so my friend says that I have to rent a hotel, and that I can't stay the night. So I help them keep their place, and I can't be trusted to stay there even though my ex-friend was gone that weekend? I told my friend I was incredibly hurt by this and I decided not to visit, and she never replied. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: My friend still hasn't paid me back, and won't respond to my texts. "
4ysp8y,,"Ok so we recently made a 10 man league, we are all friends. The problem is three of the people don't know anything about football.

Then later today my friend H who's good at fantasy trades to J dwyane allen a decent tight end for David Johnson. In a PPR league johnson is way better than a tigh end especially an ok one. So i try and get the vote vetoed because its clearly taking advantage f J, but the commissioner named Z is torn. I then get into an argument with H about how he didnt know what he was doing and H tried to claim I did the same with Dalton for Brady. Am I the asshole for apparently doing the same or is he for taking advantage of a new person. "

Anyway she hungout there for awhile and they always text and whatnot but a few weeks ago, she told me that he got drunk and said he ""should've fucked her in high school so he'd have bragging rights since she is hot now"".

Today at 4:25 PM I get a text from my aunt : "" at 5 PM I'll pick you up, we're going to eat out sushi!""

I told her that I said I have plans and not sure if I would go out, she said my mom said it was okay for me to go out. Mom comes home and I tell her what the hell is going on cause I said I'm most likely not available today.


She starts calling me a cunt for being rude because I didn't say a specific time, and it's ""more than likely my friend will bail on me either way"", eventually I went out to eat Sushi and NOT miss out hanging out with my bud, but who was at fault here?"
4ywc0a,,"My mother is like most mothers, she tries to force feed us at every opportunity then guilts us about how we're not grateful enough for all she does for us. Standard fare. We're visiting with my sister right now as Sister wants to spend time with my daughter. 

Tonight Mother came in from sofa shopping with Sister and was ravenous. Mother likes to eat lots of small meals throughout the day and hadn't eaten in probably 4 hours at this point. Mother cooks while I take care of Daughter. Sister helps Mother cook at the beginning but ends up just hanging out in her room. Mother takes her meal into the lounge to watch TV while she eats and tells me to leave Daughter with her while I get mine. I don't see the point in bothering her with Daughter so take Daughter with me into kitchen to get my food. Sister is already in kitchen and serving herself. I wait until she's done then grab a plate and start serving myself, all with Daughter on my hip. Sister asks why Daughter isn't in lounge, I tell her I didn't see the point in hassling Mother. Sister tells me not to serve myself because the pans are hot and I'm going to burn Daughter. She is very snarky about it. 

I wasn't hungry to begin with and didn't ask for this meal but was going to eat it to keep Mother happy, as I usually would. I don't see any reason to put up with Sister's shittiness and sit eating a meal I don't want while I am now sobbing. 

I take Daughter and myself into the spare room where we are sleeping and play with her some more. Mother is very unhappy that I'm not eating the meal but I really am sick of engaging in negative behaviour all the fucking time and while I'm used to and willing to put up with my mother I don't think I should have to pander to my sister as well. 

After Mother finishes her meal she follows me round and physically removes my daughter from me trying to make me eat while in trying to get my daughter ready for bed. This only upsets me further and I eventually stop responding to mother wh"
4yxhzl,,"Recently a roommate and I moved into an apartment complex built in the 1970s.  It isn't the most modern unit, and living noises are somewhat of a given.  I generally try to keep a pretty cordial attitude with our neighbors, but our downstairs neighbor in particular has started to concern me with noise complaints.

The first two times they came to me personally and complained of noises late at night.  I complied and was happy that they had notified me that I was disturbing their sleep by being out late at night.  No more after midnight sitting on the porch, I could do that.

The second time was again out on the porch and I had fallen asleep in a lawn chair.  I was a bit groggy and my leg was a bit numb and I fell down.  The next day she came to me and complained that the noise had woken her up.  I complied again and made a point to not be out after 10pm anymore but instead to retire to my room and avoid walking around the apartment.

Today at 4:30 I was doing some laundry and my roommate was out on the balcony having a beer and enjoying the nice weather.  I came back and he looked rather upset and told me that she had come to him and began to yell and curse at him for the noise my hamper was making rolling across the carpet.

I'm stressed to the point of exhaustion trying everything to be quiet and respectful.  I've apologized profusely and tried to do better, but this one has me shaking my head in frustration.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect normal living noises during the daytime and it's not as though we're banging against the walls or cranking music up late at night.  

I understand the late at night noises being an issue and I'm more than happy to comply by keeping to our respective rooms past 10 at night, but yelling and cursing at my roommate for noise made during the afternoon hours seems a bit excessive.  Are we being the assholes here?"
4yxoax,,So I am now a senior in high school and my dad no longer wants to drive me 30 minutes everyday to the private school he's making me go to. He tells me I need to get my license and accept responsibility for myself now because I am an adult. He says I should be driving just like everyone else my age is and he shouldn't be driving a 17 year old around anymore... I told him I don't like driving as it makes me very anxious and nervous and tense (probably because of the bad car accidents i was in when i was a kid) and it also makes me very on edge for the rest of the day. I've practiced driving a bunch but i really hate doing it. I'd much rather just take a bus or walk but sadly there's no way to do that in this case scenario. I'm not sure what else to say so if there's any other info needed feel free to ask and i'll answer your questions.

4z3quo,,"This story needs a little setup, so bear with me. My cousin and I shared a dorm with two of the worst roommates imaginable last year. Constant partying and loud music in the middle of the night at least 4 days a week. The other 3 they were just generally loud. When it's finally time to move into a new apartment my cousin and I picked out a two person and everything was great until today.

He walked in about an hour ago with his two friends, both generally cool people. The problem that I had is that they were being essentially the same as the original bad roommates mentioned. I would have thought that dealing with this from the other situation would prevent issues like this, but I guess not. Anyway, I was trying to sleep and that didn't last long. Neither did programming after I jumped on that. We both pay equal rent, so it's neither person has more fiscal control than the other. I was just wondering if I would be in the wrong bringing this up as an issue and asking him to ask me before having people over. I mean, yeah it's his house, but it's just as much my house.

I really don't want to be rude or ruin this thing we've got going, but I also want to be able to sleep or work whenever I want in an apartment I'm paying several hundred dollars a month to have."
4zbpos,,"[Here's the thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4z5fku/i_made_a_back_to_school_advice_video_for_high/d6t0dqw)

I submitted a post to /r/Newtubers posting a video I made on my Youtube channel. Up until last week, self plug posts were acceptable, but they recently changed that in the last week unbeknownst to me. For the record, the rules on that sub have changed at least 3 times in the past month, sometimes I don't realize they've changed.

Upon asking the mod that removed the post why it was removed, he told me to go read the rules. I did re-read them but didn't see a rule indicating why my post wasn't allowed and still wanted clarification as to why it was removed so I don't make the same mistake in the future... And it escalated from there, for no good reason imo.

After my lengthy final reply, he subsequently [game me a temporary ban/time out](http://imgur.com/a/SLl7C) to which he's escalated it to a [lengthier ban](http://imgur.com/a/1VovB) still insisting that i'm being rude and out of line.

Maybe i'm not seeing it, but i'm having a hard time understanding why i'm being unreasonable/the asshole? I asked him what rule I broke when posting and he wouldn't tell me, instead he told me that's my job to find out... When I tried to find out but couldn't see I asked for further clarification and he jumped and told me he's not my servant. I think he's the asshole, but maybe it's me? I'm not sure. I did make a jab telling him he's giving me attitude, but it looks like he took that jab and impaled me in return. I thought mods jobs were to be of help and answer your questions, but I didn't get that at all from him. And he tells me i'm overly sensitive, but bans me and tells me i'm being 'quite rude' to him when the whole time i've just been wanting clarification.

4zfg71,,"I was having a conversation with my friend last night, and they kept on replying with ""ok"" to my messages. I was thinking it was a little odd at first, but then their last message to me was sent in what I perceived as an angry tone.

After their last message, I immediately see a notification from another app which has a group chat with the said friend. They basically said: ""Have you been uninterested in someone's conversation that you keep replying with 'ok'?"". 

Upon seeing I assume it was me the friend was talking about, as they had posted there straight after they sent their last message to me. But then my rational mind says 'What if?' it was someone else. But then I was thinking it was unlikely, so I decided to leave it for the time being.

Then I get another message from that friend in what sounds like an angry tone, and I'm thinking they must be in a bad mood or something. I was conflicted on whether to talk to the person about it, but the last message from them kinda set me off. So I send screenshots of the other group chat to my friend, and then basically assume (maybe I shouldn't have?) that they are talking about me. And my friend denies it, and tells me to ""fuck off"", and starts calling me an asshole (literally).

My coworker is constantly pulling shit like this and it made me angry to hear she'd forced the host of the event completely rescheduled due to her own conflict.  

Today, another coworker asks if I'm going.  The event is tomorrow.  I say no, that I have other plans, to which I'm called ""anti-social"" by several of them.  I shrug and let the comment be.  

So, am I the asshole for telling a white lie and not attending the event tomorrow?

4zov6v,,"I work at a charity shop, so it's unpaid volunteer work, every weekend and some weekdays (when they need me). I've already told them I can't work next Saturday because I'm moving and need to go sort shit out on that day and they said it was fine. Now I've hardly been able to see my boyfriend over the summer for various reasons and this Sunday we're both free and I have the house to myself, only problem being, I'm scheduled to work that day. I know that they'll be fine without me and there are other volunteers, but I definitely don't feel comfortable telling them that's why I don't want to work that day. AITA if I lie about why I can't go in? Or rather, how much of an asshole am I?"
4zxql1,,"Today, I'm supposed to pick up someone from the train station in the afternoon. My friend, let's call him Chris, has asked me to send him to the bus station, which is a few minutes away from the train station, to buy a bus ticket. Problem is, I don't want to. My feelings towards Chris has been iffy for a while. In my circle of friends, I'm the only one who has a car so we always carpool together only when we have the same destination. Everything is located nearby so my other friends usually cycle to places like the bank, laundromat, post office etc. but not Chris, he calls me up and asks me to send him there because he doesn't like the heat when he cycles. There was an instance where my other friends all collected some cash and gave it to me as petrol money, since I had been driving them around for around three months. I refused at first but accepted it in the end. I found out from my friend that Chris had pulled him aside and said ""What? Did you guys seriously pay MSkyDragons? She said it was fine."" He only chipped in after being lectured by my other friends. Sometimes when I'm already eating at a restaurant with friends, he'll call me to pick him up from his place just so he can join us. After this, I've been reluctant to drive him anywhere, like the bus station, even if I would've readily done the same for any of my other friends. I sometimes feel like we're only friends so that he can sit in my car. Am I the asshole?

EDIT : Just an update, when I told him that I couldn't send him to the bus station, he said it was fine and that he had another friend who could send him anyway. Then why ask me, wtf???"
5000pc,,"Last summer a friend of mine, lets call him Peter, was in a jam money-wise. I offered to borrow him money to which he agreed, but not before telling me that he didn't know how long it would take for him to pay me back. I said that was okay and proceeded to lend him the money.  
  
Fast forward about 4 months, I'm in a conversation with Peter and our mutual friends when he tells us about this new PC he's bought. It registers with me, but I think nothing more of it. A little while later, he acquires a car, which he says his father gave him.  
  
Hmm, okay...  
I confront him and ask him why he isn't paying me back instead of buying things for himself. He tells me the PC was bought on an installment payment, so he didn't actually front all the money. We talk back and forth and I end up thinking that he's really not that well off and decide to do what I now regret. I tell Peter to forget about the money he owes me. That I don't want money to get in the way of our friendship.  
  
Couple months later I find out he's also bought a phone (Also an installment payment) and he's gotten rid of the previous car in favor of another one. At this point I feel violated. Instead of paying me back a little every month he has three installment payments (PC, phone, the 2nd car), a membership to a gym and can still afford gas for his car.  
  
I've talked with him and while he says he'll get the money our friendship is definitely ruined now. His argument is that I told him to forget about the money, mine that he was never honest with me about his financial situation. AITA?  
  
Non-native speaker, excuse any confusion please.

502cdw,,"Well, I tipped her, just less than normal.

I went to a restaurant today and I knew I wanted a malt after my meal. When I was ordering my food, I asked the waitress if I could order it now but have it at the end, she said ""Yeah, I'll have them make it and put it in the freezer"" I told her I didn't want that, I wanted it made at the end and before I could say I'd wait to order it she said she could do it that way too.

A few times during my meal she asked did I want the malt yet and I reiterated that I would let her know when I was ready. After the meal I was signing the CC receipt I told her I was ready for the malt whenever she was (lazy day today, in no hurry) and I  saw her turn to the freezer and pull out the malt.....

So I asked her how long the malt was in there and if I wasn't clear about not wanting the malt until I asked for it and she said she had the guy make it ""like three minutes ago"" and was pretty visibly annoyed when she said she can make it again if I want. Obviously, which I said 3+ times, I wanted it when I asked for it, so I said okay and she re-made it, and I only tipped her 10%.

Am I the asshole for that?

502f8k,,"So as of now, I rarely watch TV. I usually deal with my laptop. I only watch WWE now, even if the episodes are quite delayed. All the episodes are during the weekends. So the schedule for the shows are like this.

Raw - Fridays 9:50pm - 12:00am+ AND Sundays 6:50pm - 10:15pm

Saturday - not an issue because it's very late.

Sunday 8:00am - 11:00am (Vintage, NXT and Smackdown)

Now my little sister wants to watch TV at the same time that I also watch. Given that we already talked about this that already and I sacrificed my Fridays since there's a replay on Sunday. During Sunday Morning, my sister keeps complaining and she does nothing anyways.

However, this sunday, we're having dinner when my sister changed the channel while I was watching a new episode of Raw. Since I didn't get to watch it on Friday, I had to watch the replay. I don't downloading since it takes about 5 hours to download a single episode and I'm only going to watch it once and immediately delete it. I tried to change the channel back but my dad prevented me from doing and calling me selfish and an addict. It is very disappointing considering I don't even complain about TV the whole day nor the weekdays. Calling me an addict considering I only watch this during the weekends and during the weekdays, I just stay with my laptop, not even related to WWE."
5047lt,,"So I'm currently in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend who I've known for 5 years now. We are aged 19(me) and 18(her). I love her dearly and I believe she loves me as well. We play a lot of xbox together, but we never really do anything else. So recently she has been spending more and more time with this guy we both have know now for little over a year now. Usually I don't really care who she talks too but lately I've noticed how much they talk, and how close they are getting... Like really uncomfortably close....
Examples are sometimes I'll ask to Skype with her, but she'll refuse, but turn around and Skype this guy for hours. Other times she'll talk about things and make jokes she wouldn't usually make around me when she's with him. Now mind you I wouldn't have these suspicions if she first hadn't already have cheated on me a while back. She also broke up with me for another guy, just to be broken up with a month later. Recently she had this girl send her a picture if her tits behind my back, claiming that they were just friends, and that that was something girls do. So idk am I rely just bring a jealous clingy boyfriend as she claims, or are my concerns legitimate?"

Now I was actually really excited about the news and I wanted to share it so I went into the living room where my sister (she is with us for the summer but she leaves back to college in a few days) I told her without actually thinking and she got ad at me. Like ""UGH I didnt want to know that you always ruin movies for me"" Now I am a massive film buff especially with comic movies Batman is like my all time favorite fictional character. She just yelled at me tho but I though ""well your gonna find out eventually"" Im pretty sure she follows the same batman facebook page as me. Ever since she became an adult tho she has been mean I think living in such a big city by herself has made her hardened its annoying when I tell her a story and she gets cocky about it. I really dislike her attitude. But the question stands AITA?? "
50a7am,,"Yesterday, I was out with my boyfriend. Roommate invited mutual people we know over our house while me and bf were away. This guy, Bob, takes 3 ramens from me and my bf's personal closet area without asking us. I see the ramen on my roomie's Facebook feed and confront them. I tell Bob not to take things that are not his without asking. He says it's just ramen and my bf is the one who paid for it, so it's not mine anyway. I tell him it doesn't matter if it was caviar or dirt, he shouldn't take things that do not belong to him and that I am actually the one who buys all the food in the house with my own money.

And I realize ramen is inexpensive (this was on the more expensive side as they were $2 each). It wasn't about the ramen, it was about the principle of it. You just don't take things that aren't yours. I would've given him some if he had just asked me. He has a history of imposing himself and basically being a leech, so I also didn't want to set a precedent that he can just come in and take whatever he wants. Now everyone is walking on eggshells around me. I offered food to my roommate today and she said ""are you sure?"" like I'm about to snatch the food out of her hands. So am I the asshole here?"
50b2lw,,"This happened last year. Me(M19) and Nicole(F19) were on a trip with our classes to another country. Our classes stayed in the same hotel, for 4 days and 3 nights. Boys for themselves, and girls for themselves. 




Nicole and I had known each other for a few months. She had just moved to our school and we became good friends in a short time. Nicole has a boyfriend, Jeff(M21), who's a very jealous type, but chose to trust that I wouldn't hit on(flirt with) Nicole. I wasn't interested in her anyways. Only as friends. 




So at this trip, everyone got drunk, day and night, including me. But Nicole doesn't drink. So she was sober the whole time. She would lean up against me at night when we went to a mall or restaurant to eat. As in, her back, tightly up against my front. Often. 




Every night, Nicole would come into my room. She would lay on my bed, and I on my roommate's bed. He would always be out partying, so we had the room for ourselves.




Every time Nicole left my room in the morning, my classmates would see her leave, so they're my witnesses. As their rooms were right next to mine.




The last night, I threw up, drunk and dizzy. We both lay on the same bed. And she moved her hips forward and backwards, kinda humping my left leg. I held my hands around Nicole and put her on top of me. And she would, willingly, keep moving her hips in motion around my crotch.




Nicole leaned forwards at the same time so our heads would be right next to each other, while still moving her hips. I didn't make the move, to go for it. Nicole then got up and repeatedly said ""I can't do this, I have a boyfriend""




Jeff called her while she was in my room, Nicole lied to Jeff and said she was in my room, so she could help me because I threw up and was dizzy and so on. She would then leave the room. We didn't tell anyone.




Fast forward almost 6 months, Nicole chose to tell Jeff about what happened. But Nicole told a different story, that I tried to rape her on the last night,"

Here's context:

This was at lunch. She was across the school, I'm in the cafeteria. How my school works is that, once you enter the cafeteria, you can't leave until lunch is over. If you try, you'll be sent back into the lunchroom. She and I both know this. That made going to her out of the question. She *had* to come to me. Our cafeteria has an indoor and outdoor section. It's pretty well known, too. She's been here for a year now. It's not exactly hidden.

My point of view is thus: Why should I have to convince her to come sit with me? If she didn't want to, fine. If she wanted to, cool. But don't complain that you're lonely and make me fucking negotiate with you to come sit with me. There was nothing coming after the ""but"" either. She just does that for some reason. 

I've been annoyed lately because of a coworker, so I've been less patient, but come on. It's like she's a needy puppy and I'm not in the mood for needless bullshit right now."

50ile1,,"Okay, I've never done this before, let alone ever considered doing this. But I need a way to get this out of my system and get some kind of confirmation about the whole situation. I'm going to write my thoughts as they come, so apologies if it's a bit mall-structured (or poorly written as I'm not natively English).

The whole story of me and my ex-girlfriend started about 1.8 years ago. We met each other, fell in love quite quickly and from there on we formed a couple. The beginning was awesome, like in most relationships I guess. Everybody has some quirks about them, I mean... It's not like I'm the perfect one. But I'm easy going and when problems arrive, I communicate and try to find the best way to solve them. Early on, about 2 months into the relationship, I got some more information about her ex-boyfriend. Basically, their relationship lasted a while (3 years if I recall correctly). But it left her totally broken in a mental way which even required help from a psychologist.

Fast forward to the 1 year mark, we're both very happy together. I'm totally committed to her, I just basically love her. But the sex gets problematic, she told me she isn't feeling to well with it all. That it hurts... But not as an excuse, it was genuine. She could always talk freely with me, even if it hurt in the process. This was true for the both of us.
Fast forward to 1.6 years together. At this point we haven't had sex in months, she doesn't feel right about it. So of course I tried to support her and tell her we can get some help from outside, because it's getting problematic at this point. The gynecologist told here everything was fine but redirected her to a sexologist. At this point in time, she asked me if I'm willing to support her through this process, there wasn't a single hair on my head that thought otherwise.

She never went to the sexologist, instead the week after the appointment with the gynecologist. She came over, told me she kind of lost her feelings for me as her b"
50jy75,,"So to preface this, I'm a white guy and I've been working as a delivery driver for a Mexican restaurant for over 6 months now. 

As part of the perks of my job I get free meals. When employees order food we usually just write what we want down on a piece of paper and hand it to the chefs. 

I've been noticing lately that a lot of the chefs seem kind of cold to me. I'm a naturally shy and timid person in general and I'm not good at asking other people for help. It's also loud inside the restaurant. The chefs are always busy so I feel awkward already about asking them to take my order, and not all of them speak good English so there's  also kind of another divide there too. 

I'm making this post because I've noticed that some of the chefs who I used to be cool with have started being kind of cold to me. I think it's because I only talk to them when I'm asking them to make me food. I noticed this especially yesterday and also today. Yesterday when I was asking one of the chefs to take my order it was the first time I had talked to him all day, and I noticed a new employee kind of looking at me funny when I did so. Today the same thing, when I asked another chef if he could take my order I noticed other people in the restaurant looking at me like I had said something wrong. I feel like the chefs think I'm bossing them around, which I absolutely am not. Another employee had sort of admonished me already about how I asked the chefs to take my order, when I asked them in English she told me how to ask them in Spanish, say please in Spanish, and correctly pronounce the chefs name. 

I feel like they're really just being oversensitive because I'm white. There have been other Mexican drivers here and they are even more direct with the chefs than I am. I think the fact that I'm white and don't speak Spanish creates kind of a natural divide between me and the employees compounded by the fact that I dont work in the kitchen. I think it's sort of unfair for them to treat me like"

5wtlib,,"So yesterday was Fat Tuesday as many of you may know. So I took a couple boxes of 4 packs of these donuts they only make that day called packi to work to give out to my coworkers. By the end of my 10 hour shift there were still four left so I offered some to the night crew and the drive they guy we will call packzi guy said he wanted one. While he is collecting money and taking an order I pull one out and wrap it up in some napkins for him and jokingly grab the box and say I am taking the red home. I knew he would probably want more after he had a bite but nonetheless was planning on leaving the box behind anyway. So packzi guy tries it and I am already thinking he will probably ask for one more while I am getting together my stuff.

He had been giving me a hard time that day, not in a mean way but acting like the annoying little brother I never wanted if u know what I mean. Just being obnoxious since he clocked in hours earlier. So then he asks if he can have the rest and I, jokingly, point to the price sticker on the box saying he had to pay for it. He said he would pay basically 65% of it and I agreed. I mean if he seriously wants to give me free money why not right? 

AITA for charging him for packzi I was just going to leave there for everyone?"

5xaj90,,"I have been downsizing and that turned into selling a lot of my things online because they're excellent condition, I just have no need or want from them. I found a website where the people who buy from you can review you, and up until now, I've received nothing but glowing reviews. 

This one lady wanted to buy 10 of the items I had for sale, which should have came to a total of $60 had they went for my asking price but she asked me for a deal. I have no problem with that, I told her I would let her have all the items for $30 and to please let me know if this price worked for her. She told me that it did work for her. She was extremely nice and friendly the entire time we were messaging online about the items and she was very happy with price I was offering. There was 5 pictures of each item and I made sure that she was happy with these items and really wanted to purchase them.

Then came yesterday when it was time for her to purchase the items. She arrived at my apartment building and buzzed me. She was for some reason laughing when she asked for me and told me she was here for the items. My BF helped me carry down some of the items and to hold doors open for me. I approached the lady and we handed her the items. She looked them over , I asked her if she was satisfied with the items in person and if she was still ok with the price. She handed me the money, my boyfriend and I told her to have a great day and she walked back to her car.

Several hours after this transaction took place, at 11:30 pm, I get a message from this lady: 

""Hello. Thank you for reviewing me as a great buyer. I was absolutely unimpressed with the price that I paid for these items or the way that you brought some highly aggressive back up to the sale.

5xekzz,,"Okay so just a note before I start, this happened years ago around when GTA Online first came out. Myself and the guy involved in this story are good friends now, although when this happened he was pretty pissed for months. I've been thinking back to this and honestly can't decide which of us were the asshole in this situation so I figured I'd get a third party's opinion.

Alright, so like I said this happened around when GTA Online first came out and at that time there were **lots** of cheats/hacks/exploits going around. My friend took part in these exploits where as I did not, the specific things he did were:

* Join a hacked lobby so he was level 152 (incredibly high, I was only level 14)

* Got someone to hack him in tonnes of money

* Did a glitch to get a tank as an ""owned"" vehicle (this should not be possible, it meant he could respawn it cheaply and if you destroyed the tank you were penalized and even sometimes kicked for destroying someones personal vehicle)

Now I didn't mind him having all of these glitched/hacked stuff, I personally didn't take part in it but it never bothered me that he cheated because it didn't really effect me. Usually we played together just messing around in free roam (we were in a group of 5-6 usually if it's of any relevance). We did usually try and fuck with each other all in good spirited fun, blowing up each others cars, sniping each other off rooftops etc. We did this almost every night.

Now, the problem came in one night in particular, I can't remember what it was but I was trying to do something, most likely trying to earn money by robing shops (like I said I didn't cheat so I was usually low on cash while the rest of the group had more money than they could possibly spend). The friend who glitched/cheated earlier decided to fuck with me, now normally this would be fine but this one instance really pissed me off. Instead of just blowing up my car or killing me once or twice he continually killed me/destroyed my car.

5xkju9,,"I'm so used to being called crazy and over emotional by men that I have no gauge as to whether something is seriously wrong or whether I'm just blowing things way to far out of proportion. Recently my boyfriend and I got in a fight because he wanted to hang out with some friends of mine when I wasn't around, at first I was uncomfortable because I felt it was important we each have our own friends so that if we ever break up it doesn't end up one of us (me) losing my entire support system because in the past even when he cheated on me, he somehow convinced our friends I was in the wrong and I was the asshole. Eventually though I said it was no big deal that I thought it was more an issue of having shitty friends vs. not having shitty friends and that if he wanted to hang out with them that was fine with me. Today we were planning on going out with friends and all of a sudden he was worried about me having my own friends. Red flag. I could tell it was something more than that and eventually he was accusing me of talking shit about him and making him sound like a manipulative dick when really he wasn't. He demanded to see my phone at which point I said no because you're only trying to fight and nothing productive can come of this, you're welcome to look at my phone anytime once you calm down, there is no password and I have nothing to hide. After he pouted and accused me of cheating I finally gave it to him anyway and as expected he said I was trying to make everyone think he's a ""bipolar manipulative asshole"" though the things I said were literally just exact quotes or events that actually happened with no analysis or anything so I feel like if the truth comes off as you being a manipulative ass, maybe you're being a manipulative ass? Also I very clearly included things taking responsibility for my own fuck up because obviously most fights aren't entirely at the fault of one person. He then decided he didn't want me to talk to my friends about our fights at all which "
5xmc2m,,"So, basically, this creep messaged me and wouldnt leave me alone. And he sent me his phone number really early on requesting I sext with him. Made it clear I wasn't interested, but he wouldnt let off. So. Instead of just blocking him like any normal person would, I felt kind of spiteful, because after a while of this constant bs from people on online dating sites, you get irritated. 

Basically, I work at a car dealership. And we've learned that when customers use the Truecar app, their info gets sent to every dealer within 50 miles of their zip code that sells the model of vehicle they want. And I've used it to prank my friends, but never to this extent. 

Basically, I took this guys number, and gave him a fake name and email, and submitted it to every single dealership in town. Sent in an inquiry for every brand of vehicle. And on some even put that I didn't want to be called at all after 10am, only call before 10am. 

So, this guy is going to get probably about 100 calls on Monday from different car dealerships across the city asking ""Dick"" when he can come in to meet with their designated true car advisor. 

Now that its done and over with, I'm feeling a bit guilty, and definitely like an asshole. "
5xtk0z,,"It feels like every couple days she has some kind of issue or problem with me and it's always either an abstract concept with no specifics (ex: ""you don't treat me the same way you used to!"") or a blatant assumption based on something I say/do (ex: ""So you're going to stop me from buying things you deem unnecessary!"" because I've told her that she shouldn't starve herself to buy clothes one time when she told me that she was going to).

Turns out I don't react to constant fighting over abstract immeasurable concepts very well and I need more time to myself to recovery and spend less time with her as a result, which only increased the fighting as now she feels ""lonely"" despite me still talking to her for hours a day and giving her support in general.

Recently I've just been getting annoyed every time there's some kind of issue between us. Nothing happens to warrant fighting or arguing but it still happens. I tell her I'd like to invest some money a month for our children when we have them and we're financially stable and she starts a fight with me over her assumptions that I'll make us live ""poorly"" to make up for it. I mentioned to her I'd appreciate it if she bought me flowers sometime (the topic was on the subject of buying flowers) and she starts a fight about how it would make her feel unwomanly. I'm mentally exhausted from fighting so much and she starts a fight about how she feels ""rejected"" and ""lonely"" despite us still talking/hanging out for hours that day.

I feel like an asshole because she's upset over things and it just annoys me and drives us further apart. On the other hand it's awful to have constant fighting over what is literally nothing (assumptions) or abstract concepts like I she feels I don't give her enough attention when I'm talking to her hours a day."

After I got here, she made excuses every day to not see me. The first day she said she was too bored to go out . The second day she said she couldn't go out because she had to have lunch with her friend and then her father bought her a cake and she had to stay home with her family.  The third day she said she had an allergy shot that made her face swell up so she didn't want to go out in public. 

 It seems pretty apparent to me that she has made excuses to avoid me the entire time I was here for whatever reason. I don't know her true motivation so I can't speculate on it, but her avoidance of me makes me think that she's not a true friend of mine. I told her as much and said there's no point in us being friends if I am not a priority at all. If a friend of mine came to visit where I live from another country for a few days, I would make a major effort to see him or her, regardless of gender or whether we dated in the past. I have done this before more than once. I like seeing my friends.

AITA to be offended? Am I wrong to think she's not a true friend?"
5y57h9,,"In my opinion, it's just so unsafe. He wouldn't listen to me when I asked me not to, so out of anger I lectured him for thirty minutes about it. He says he won't get pulled over, and everything will be fine, and that he's okay to drive, but it's just not okay to do in my mind. Should I just leave him be, or am I in the right for being so concerned about it?"
5yco30,,"Every time my girlfriend gives me shit for doing trivial things (ie. leaving lights on, leaving the seat up...) I have to toe the line and say stuff like, sorry honey I'll stop doing it, I promise. Then I catch her doing stuff like; leaving half drank glasses of water, not hanging her jacket up when she comes home, leaving piles of hair in the bathroom... and I bite my tongue. Am I just the pot callling the kettle black?"
5ynjbp,,"My wife and I just recently lost a baby. She was 12 weeks pregnant. Our first together but my third alone. It hit us pretty hard. Her doctors said she needed to have a procedure to remove the baby, at this point it would have been traumatic for her to ""eject"" the baby on her own.(That was the term the doctors used not me.) My wife's mother decides to show up to show her some support. Her mother is a bit odd which I've excepted. Now, when she shows up, she brings her flea ridden dog to our home. I'm already not happy about this, fleas can easily infest a home and we already have enough to worry about. So today was the day of the procedure. My wife is in her hospital bed getting prepped for the procedure, and her mother keeps making these obnoxious, jokes trying to make the nurses laugh. My wife is used to her mother, but I'm not. I didn't find the time and place very appropriate for her jokes and comments. I know we all grieve at different paces but this woman looked and me and noticed I wasn't laughing when she made her comments. Then she slaps me on the back and yells ""cheer up!"" It took all my will not to tell her to leave the room and wait in the lobby. She leaves during the procedure to walk her dog, and when she returns she says that we may have a bug problem at the house. I asked why and she raised her pant legs up to show me that her legs were covered in bites. She didnt even stop to think MAYBE its her dog that she slept with last night that's infested with fleas! I'm going to ask her to leave once we all wake up later on today cause were all pretty tired, especially my wife. So....Am I the ass hole?

UPDATE: The problem worked out everyone, she is leaving. I just wanted to know if I was being an ass hole for how I was feeling. I thank everyone that listened and shared their condolences. "

5yxfoq,,"I moved out of my parents house some eight years ago. In all that time my parents have phoned me exactly twice, once to inform me that my grandmother died, and once at the suggestion of my brother (who still lives with them) to invite themselves to come around in a few weeks time for my thirtieth birthday. This would be the first time they have visited me. Otherwise, the only communication I get is the very occasional email informing me of things like them having surgery.

In return, I really only call for birthday's, Christmas, and mothers/fathers day, and once a year for Xmas I'll visit. But I never feel comfortable doing so. Since I moved out I've found it difficult to relax around them, every phone call and visit is extremely awkward and full of literally nothing but small talk. They have nothing to say to me, and I don't really have anything I feel comfortable saying to them. 

We've always had our differences. They are both fairly unintelligent people who take little interest in the world outside of whatever murder mystery is on TV at the time, and both of them struggle to show any ability to be genuine or nurturing, instead using efforts to mock and belittle whenever a serious issue was brought up. As such, I spent most of my teenage years telling them nothing, and it's now just routine. 

For example, if my SO was contacted by a recruitment agent about a possible job, she would inevitably call her family to discuss it. If it happened to me, I wouldn't even bother to tell my family, as I don't see it as any of their business at that stage, and would probably only tell my brother via Facebook if I actually changed jobs. 

I just don't feel comfortable speaking to them. I always get anxious when I have to, and I always end up stuck in a long conversation which is 10% greetings and 90% small talk about the weather, or people I don't know, or just otherwise irrelevant stuff. I don't feel I could call them for advice. I don't think they would give good - nay any -"
5z10fu,,"Me and my best friend are currently in our first year of college. He lives in a house with, like, four other dudes, and he wanted to adopt a dog. He already has one, and a couple bearded dragons that he doesn't really take care of (maybe I'm being biased, but when i was watching them, their tank was filthy and apparently, he'd been letting them roam around his room unsupervised). 

So then he adopted a puppy, which his landlord already told him was against the rules, and his roommates already said they were not okay with. He did this when his roommates weren't home, so I told one of them what happened.

Now his whole family is messaging me, telling me that I was being an asshole and I should have considered his feelings first (he is going through a really hard time right now emotionally. He's getting the help he needs from a therapist, I think). 

Am I the asshole here? Should I have done something else? "
5z3kke,,"So I live with my parents and I dont really go out much usually to the movies by myself. But I do call my friend anthony once in awhile and we go to the bar or something. Anyways last night I asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said yes and we met at a bar and met a few other friends of ours Travis and Alex. Now I also dont use Snapchat a whole lot but I will sometimes. We all started drinking at a regular bar and then we went and ate at a sports bar. That was fun it felt good to socialize. Now I sent a snapchat to all of my friends during the night (both of my parents are on my friends list). I was a little drunk but it was only a video of me and everyone at the dinner table. I just thought it was cool. Then I went home and slept. But earlier tonight my mom said to me ""why do you send me snapchat videos of you drinking"" I said ""well I didnt just send it to you I sent it to all of my friends"" she said ""well quit sending me those when you are drinking"". She does complain about stupid stuff all the time. I mean I dont party ALL the time and I just sent one snapchat. I think she is overreacting but I MIGHT be an asshole for doing that. On the other hand tho I am an adult and I can snapchat whatever I want. Am I in the wrong tho?  "

5z9uig,,"Recently my father who is 74 spoke to me about my inheritance and how it will be split between myself and my two half siblings. I am 22, my half sister is 33 and my half brother is 36. I have no kids or wife, they are both married, sister with two kids, brother with one kid. 

Myself and my sister have a good relationship with eachother and our father, while neither myself or my father speak to my brother, and my sister rarely does. I have seen this affect my father emotionally quite a lot, as my brother also doesn't allow my father to see his granddaughter, my niece, who I have never met. My father has met the niece only once. 

I have been told by my dad that I will be receiving around 200k in the will, my sister 200k, and my brothers daughter (not him) around 100k. 

I argued with him that he has no part in her life and that this is ridiculous and insulting to me and my sister. This probably wouldn't bother me enough to argue except the fact that my father is not my biological father, I was born through a sperm donor, even though he's raised me my entire life, we do not share blood. 

Him leaving money to her feels to me that he does care about biology, while he's told me he does not, as he raised me as my father. 

I understand he can do with his money as he wants, but I also feel that actions speak louder than words, and leaving 100k is a big action.


EDIT for clarification from first reply:

I have no anger towards her, I just feel that she is no different from any other random girl. My father has met her once, and had no other contact with her. I don't know if I made this clear, but my issue is that he is leaving money for her, while he doesn't know her, solely because she is his biological granddaughter, while simultaneously telling me that sharing blood doesn't matter. So the fact is that he does care about blood, as he cares for her, even though he has never known her at all. As his non-biological son, this is painful to me as I do not share his blood"

It had unnatural streaks in it and that's a bit of a turn of for me so I replied honestly with ""I personally find that kind of thing unattractive"" or something of the sort.

She got it done and no surprises I didn't like it. I didn't mention anything or say anything bad about it whatsoever. She asked me if I disliked it and I replied honestly with ""It looks good overall just don't like the unnatural streaks.""

I am aware it isn't my buisness but she does these things all the time and I just became fed up with it, it's going to get her in trouble one day. This is the first time I said something about it.

5zjdcz,,"Backstory: My daughter has a neurological issue which has caused her some struggles. She misses school sometimes for hospital stays (usually only 2-3 days at a time now). She has some motor delays and speech impediments. She has absence and focal seizures that are easily mistaken for just zoning out or just being disruptive. I am very (possibly overly) sensitive to feeling like people underestimate her or see the worst in her. I tend to get upset with her school for how they grade or fail to reward her. 

Two recent examples: she got a horrible report card this semester. She was marked 'does not meet standard' on things I know she has down cold. In the conference, the teacher said flat out that they marked her down if she didn't say the exact word correctly because of her speech impediments. So she can identify a trapezoid and a sphere, but since she says crapasoy and spear, no credit. She can tell you if you are making the correct blended sounds, but since she cannot produce blended sounds like tr/pr she is marked down as not recognizing them and is essentially failing kindergarten- again. They already held her back. They also would cut her off if she did not answer within a few seconds, despite knowing and acknowledging that she has frequent absence seizures. 

Also, they gave awards to kids who made 100 days with no tardies or unexcused absences. She had neither, but they still did not give her an award. When asked afterwards, it was because she had no unexcused absences but since she had spent a total of 11 excused days (1 for a socio-psych eval the school requested, the rest in-hospital with extra homework to make up for what she missed in class), they said it just wasn't fair to the kids who saw her miss so many days, but the teachers son who was hospitalized for a few days more did get an award.


This particular example: My daughter loves the science fair and worked like a dog on her project. She ended up being the only kid in her grade to complete one. She "
5zn7sc,,"I'm polite and respectful to everyone but beyond that I sort of just don't really care about other people. I'm not trying to be edgy, I just sort of don't. I see everyone else talking to each other and having fun and I just don't get it. I'm just not really interested in other people or the things they have to say. 

There are people who I DO love, and who I DO care about, and I'm not faking it with them, I really do love them and care about them, but with almost everyone else they're just kind of there. I just don't find too many things about other people to be interesting. 

I hate parties because of this and other social gatherings, because for me there isn't any type of base interest in others. Making small talk at work is hard because I don't know what to say, I know I'm supposed to say something but I end up sounding like an idiot sometimes. I try to smile at people and be friendly but eventually they figure out that I'm not really interested in them and that I just sort of have nothing to talk about. Whenever I do this, and be intentionally friendly to someone, like a coworker, or a cashier at a store I go to a lot, I become really anxious and I wonder how much longer I can keep it up. Like, how much longer can I act this way until they realize that I'm extremely socially awkward, and that I'm just kind of a small person. 

I am super socially awkward and anxious. I've always been that way. I've just sort of learned over a long period of time that other people just sort of don't want me around, and they just kind of don't want to talk to me so I stay out of everyone's way but then people think I'm an asshole because I don't smile and I don't really make any type of effort to talk to anyone. 

When I'm around other people I just kind of zone out and dissociate. I can sit by myself behind a computer for long periods of time and not care at all. I'm very used to social isolation. It doesn't bother me in the slightest, especially now that I do have people who I l"

I said sure and then I asked him where it is at, he gave me the area where it is at but not an exact location.

* Homeless guy asks me if I have spare change.
* I say I only have my card - this was true, I wasn't carrying *any* cash that day.
* He asks me if I can buy him food. 
* I agree to do so.
* I buy him a ham roll, but he doesn't like it with mayonnaise, so he somewhat rudely tells the lady working there to remake it without mayonnaise. 
* I was annoyed at this point and just wanted to pay for it and get away.
* He, however, sees a bottle of soda and says that he'll have this too. 
* This is what really annoyed me - I agreed to buy him food, but I didn't really want to buy him anything else, especially after how rude he was to the worker. 
* He didn't say please or have any manners, and honestly just added the drink to the transaction. 
* I did end up buying it for him since I know that if I was in such a situation, I would've liked something to drink. :/

5znpm0,,"Let me start out by saying, im not the original owner of the account, he allowed me to post it through his because i dont have one. Im 16F, ive been talking to this guy for a year or so now, lets call him Garrett (17M). We go to different schools so i dont see him that often. A friend of mine told me he had hooked up with this other girl, I asked this friend of mine if Garrett was in any sort of committed relationship with this other girl. My friend said she wasnt too sure but she thought they were. I didnt want to disrespect the boundary of their relationship if they really did have one, so i asked Garrett if they were infact seeing each other. However, he told me that they had just hooked up and it was a one time thing. There after, Garrett asked me who had told me that he had gotten with this girl because he didnt tell anyone and she wasnt supposed to either. I didnt want to give up the identity of the friend who told me because i didnt want to make her out to be the kind of person who spreads things that arent meant to be spread. He kept insisting and i eventually gave in and told him who told me. He later found out that the girl he got with had told 3 people but my friend was not one of those people. So in conclusion, am i the asshole for asking him about this hook up that he had that i, nor anyone was supposed to know about? And am i also the asshole for exposing my friend as a rumor spreader?"
5zny2o,,"I [22F] love my boyfriend [24M] very much, but I have an issue with his friends. He always tells me about how they consistently and frequently cheat on their girlfriends. When we hang out and he talks to them about it he doesn't flat out condone the cheating, but somewhat encourages it by telling them things like ""sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do"" or ""wow I can see why you did that"". I asked him about this and told him why this concerns me, and he says that they're his friends so he has to go along with it even though he doesn't agree with it.

I would never stop him from hanging out with his friends, but I can't help but feel a little uneasy when they go out. Am I out of line for feeling this way?

Edit: I'm asking because they're planning a big trip to either Vegas or Miami this summer and right now the idea is making me uncomfortable. But, like I said, I'd never stop him from seeing his friends. "
5zyvla,,"There's a Panera at my mall that is above the food court, where the rest of the restaurants are. The Panera is it's own restaurant with places to sit and everything, and I like the atmosphere better than the food court seating area which is always more busy and loud. 

So what I do sometimes is buy food from a place at the food court and bring it upstairs to eat at Panera. I buy a fountain drink at Panera, partly because of the free refills but mostly because I want to buy at least something there so that I have a reason to eat there. I always sit somewhere with the minimal number of seats and sometimes I'll actually eat lunch from there as well.

I've never been called out by the staff for this whole thing, but maybe they're just being polite. I know where I work, customers who routinely only order the lowest priced item hurt the store by lowering the  average transaction total. I never consider them assholes but I don't really like when they do that. So, am I an asshole for doing this at Panera?"
603xyk,,"Back in 2nd year of college, I lived with a girl, Gabby, for a year who I'd met in our dorms. We became friends but she was a bit of a spoiled princess, which bugged me, and very innocent.

We lost touch for years and she just recently added me on social media and left a strange comment. But I admit, I would say things that I prob shouldn't have to her: When I was leafing through her high school yearbook I condescendingly said: ""Gabby, when did boys start noticing you?""

When we were at a bar, I would try to stir shit, telling Gabby that a random girl at the bar was pointing at her and talking crap, muttering ""that girl has big tits and a flat ass"" about Gabby, when that didn't happen. I loved watching her get worked up over it.
One time when she was changing in front of me, I laughed at her body and said ""You've got the ass of a 7 year old boy!""

I'm now wondering if I was too harsh... my other gf's and I joke around a lot, but Gabby never stood up for herself. She had introduced me to one of her new friends, Tiffany, who not only moved in with us, but I ended up becoming really close to, and the 2 of us kinda ganged up on Gabby. I resented the fact that Gabby's dad was a doctor and paid for everything of hers, and that she tiny with a perfect body (huge boobs though no butt), while I was flat and had an occasionally abusive dad.

Shit hit the fan a year later and Tiffany &amp; I ended up having a huge falling out and stopped talking. So I ended up sending Gabby an email a year or 2 later sending a half assed apology, which she accepted, and told her she could have one of my pets who was more connected to Gabby than me, who I couldn't give attention/affection to. Gabby accepted and told me that I'd need to bring all of the cat's updated vet info, and she invited me to her new brand new condo that she secretly got while living w Tiff &amp; I. **Her intention was to leave Tiff &amp; I stranded as she shopped for a new condo behind our backs, and was going to move out"

My boyfriend explained to me that he feels like that's just not okay, that he should always know BEFORE I do things like this. I tell him that to me that's way too controlling because a lot of things are spontaneous. Does this mean that I can't do things spontaneously now without his explicit say so? He goes off telling me that it's just not okay. He doesn't like it.


I tell him that to me he is being unfair, he is way too controlling lately and I told him that I feel it's my fault because I don't express to him exactly what I think of some of the things he says to me, such as that I am WAY too negative and complain too much, so I stopped doing that. He didn't like when I didn't tell him I was bar hopping from place to place, so I started doing that (I go out to a bar like once a month, other than that we literally spend every day together. We work together.) I think he's way too interested in changing me, but he never takes care to think of the things that I want him to change, he never seriously considers them.


He went off again, telling me that I am misjudging his character, that I was insulting him by calling him controlling, and then he just tells me hes going to bed and that that's it. I explained to him that THAT was controlling, calling me - opening the conversation and then the moment things dont go his way he ends it and I have no choice but to oblige because its a phone call. He goes 'because I don't want to talk about it anymore. I want to sleep.'

608qa6,,"hey guys, just found this subreddit because I feel like i needed help and think posting and getting the advice of others would help me. (first post here btw so please tell me if there is anything wrong with my post moderators, thanks)

ok so here's a little backstory, me and my girlfriend met at the end of 2012 and we were both 14 at that point of time. we stayed together till mid 2016 where she met someone else and left me for him. they were together for a year before he left her (karma's a bitch i know). Me being the nice guy I was decided that it was a good idea to patch things up with her and talk to her again after the breakup because I felt that I just wanted to see her happy y'know. So as time goes by we suddenly started falling in love and we got together again during this time of month last year (2016), we're still together now and very in love with each other and I hope it stays this way. 

Anyways, time for the problem that I face now. I love this girl, i swear to god I do but it seems like everytime it comes to going out or making plans, she's the one making them (bet you guys didn't expect that). I am never able to think of stuff to do or places to go or anything that can be considered somewhat romantic. She is the one planning everything and bringing me out. Granted I do pay for her food sometimes and randomly buy her surprise food or chocolates at times (she loves food more than she loves gifts) so I feel like I did something but when it comes down to it, she does way more than I do when it comes to ""keeping it interesting"". Every time at night I think about what I could do but my mind just blanks on me, I am really embarrassed because eventually she will get tired of having to come up with everything and me doing nothing. 

Am I a horrible person because I am not able to think about such things? Am I not deserving of the girl I love and have known for almost 4 years now? What do I do to better the situation? Please help.

609ddj,,"So I'm out with my 2 friends who are visiting from out of state and I drive us to a brew house one night. My friend, let's call her D, is already a little bitter about going Bc she doesn't drink beer. Looking through the menu I find cider that they brew and I offer to pay for it, she drinks these exclusively. She tries two sips and she doesn't like it. My friend and I, we can call him E, continue to drink and try the brews available. We order some of their food and after about an hour we decide to leave. I've had 3 beers and know I can't drive. My friend E drank about 2 beers and about 4 sample sizes. E is 6'5"" 250 lbs. dude, it takes a good a lot of alcohol to get this man drunk. E decides to drive and I let him, the drive back is 8 minutes. D tells me we should get an uber Bc we have both been drinking. I then remember that she didn't drink and ask her if she can drive us back, no. She says no because she's scared of driving downtown, she doesn't know the way, and is afraid with the one ways and the trains in the road(some lanes are public transit only). I live and deliver in the downtown area so I know every possible way back to my apartment and which lanes to stay on and off. I ask her again because I don't want to leave my car and have to buy another trip back there before parking fares start at 8, she refuses. I'm like ""ok E is driving"", I know he is good to drive. She then looks and me and tells me ""you hate me."" and proceeds to ignore us. So I tell her,"" Look! You haven't had anything to drink tonight and you want us to pay for a ride back at 2x the rate with surge prices, I know the way and I know how to navigate through downtown. You're being really selfish right now."" She gets even more mad and ignores us the whole night after that. I let E drive us home. Was I out of line to yell at her? Or was I irresponsible for letting E drive us home?

60did7,,"This happened a couple weeks ago but the more I think about it, the more it has been bothering me. 

I work at a local dessert shop and a customer who usually comes about once every week or two walks in. She orders and the total comes out to be $7.01. She hands me a $10 if I can recall correctly and I was getting ready to hand in $2.99 in change without thinking. She suddenly stares down at me and replies ""Seriously???"". I was confused at first and said ""excuse me?"". And then she starts berating me about how she can't believe I would do this to her and that she is a regular customer and she doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. 

It finally clicked to me that she was talking about giving the 99 cents in change. I don't know if it was the mean attitude that she gave me or that while she was a regular customer, she would make me wait for her orders because she was on her phone previous times but I just did not feel like complying. I answered that $2.99 was what the change came out to be and tried handing her the coins. She waved the coins away, took her desserts and $2 change and walked away while calling out how ridiculous this situation was and that she will never support the shop again.

So am I an asshole for being ticked off and not handing over the $3?"
60doyk,,"This parking lot is shaped like the letter 'F'.  The long vertical part is just a lane with no parking, and the two horizontal lines have perpendicular parking spaces on either side with a dead end.  I went down the lower lot and turned around.  I could see at least 2 spots in the upper lot while heading back to the vertical lane.  I get to the end and a truck is heading through to the upper lot, so I wait for them to pass.  The truck drives right in between the two lots and just stops there without actually turning down the lane.  So I figured they were waiting for someone to back out of a spot or whatever, I just sit there at the end of the lower lot with my blinker on.  

In an attempt not to exaggerate, I'll try to be as realistic as possible with the following times, although I wasn't keeping time during this event.  

About 30 seconds goes by and this truck is still just sitting there.  I look around and can't see any reverse lights so I'm not really sure what he's doing.  Another 30 seconds, and now I see the driver put the parking brake on and release the brake.  At this point I assume he is waiting to pick someone up and I might as well try to squeeze past so I can park.  I see him reaching to unbuckle his seat belt so I waited a few more seconds to see if he is going to get out so I didn't get in the way.  He just sits there, so I turn down the lane, drive past, and turn into the upper lot.  This guy starts blaring his horn and I can see him screaming and throwing his hands up in my side mirror as I take the corner.  I park in one of the empty spaces and have to walk out the way I drove on.  On the way out he sarcastically thanked me for taking his spot.  I didn't know how to respond so I just awkwardly laughed and kept walking.  I kind of feel like I'm not the asshole in this situation but this guy sure made me feel like one.

60dudh,,"One of my bffs of 15 years, Carly [24 F], is getting married and I already said yes to being a bridesmaid. The problem is, I'm now discovering that I can't afford it. It's about 6 months until the wedding and I don't know what to do. I am over 2,500 dollars in debt and I don't make very much. Up until this year, I've had crappy jobs that didn't pay well, and honestly, I never budgeted. I know that I can just ask my family for help, but they are struggling financially too, and I don't want them to suffer because of my poor money choices.
This is also not the first time I've asked them to pay for my travel expenses; in fact, every year for the past 5 years they've been paying for me. I feel like it's a vicious cycle: a big event comes up, I cant afford it, i ask for help and promise that NEXT time, I'll be able to pay my way.
And repeat. I also feel guilty though, Because I'm saying no to a dear friend, not just my family. My sister Rachel [26 F] is angry. She says I have to go, I can't let my friend suffer for my choices- but either way we all suffer because they end up paying for my broke ass and I end up in more debt and guilt. I'm over it. What do I do? Am I a bad friend?
tl;dr: I'm poor and my family ends up paying for my travel every year. I want to get out of debt ans be self-supporting, But i'm saying no to being a bridesmaid. What do I do?"
60l31s,,"This guy(he's 25) and I(f, 20) have been friends for about two years. We became pretty close and one day I admitted I USED to have a crush on him when we first met but no longer felt that way. He admitted he always felt attracted to me but never thought I would be interested in him. After admitting that, he started acting flirty and saying indicative things like ""I wonder how it would be if we went out"" and ""don't you think we'd be really compatible in a relationship since we are as friends"". I realized what he was leaning towards, and told him I wasn't interested in a relationship and would rather us just stay friends. Instead of letting up, he went on to constantly bringing up how long it's been since he's been in a relationship, how he feels sad when he sees others with a SO, and how he feels lonely all the time. I continued to say I wasn't interested in a relationship but we could hang out as friends. Whenever I'd go over to hang out and we were watching something he'd get too close, laying on me, holding onto me and such, you know little things you'd expect from a couple. I soon came to find out that he was telling mutual friends at our job that I was his girlfriend although I'd been voicing the fact we are not dating repeatedly to him. He even started telling his family this, including his little sister that I went to school with and was good friends with. Trying to put a stop to it I told him we needed to have a serious talk, during which he started to beg that I give it a chance. Feeling bad, I agreed to a one week test run despite the fact I no longer care for relationships. When the week ended I told him I didn't want to continue while he insisted we did. I continued to tell him no and he continued to try and force a relationship. I started avoiding hanging out with him because he wont stop. He claims he is in love with me and won't stop til I feel the same and that he's depressed without me. He's even threatened suicide and self harm.

I turned my back to the cart while I put my groceries in my backseat, and when I turned around, a random man had taken my cart and collected the quarter for himself.


This bothered me, soI asked him for the quarter. He responded:


Man: ""I walked it here.""

Me: ""I didn't ask you to, and I need that quarter.""


He gave it to me without incident, but I felt kinda bad as I drove away. I didn't need the quarter, but he really rubbed me the wrong way. AITA?"
60lwjy,,"A little background:

Growing up afraid of my dad and being bullied in school meant I had to fight. A lot. Sometimes with words, sometimes with fists. Im the type of person that if youve got a problem you come to me and not behind my back. I stick up for myself.

I'd do damn near anything to protect the ones i care about, but I hate being touched. At all.

Were both virgins and sex isnt on the menu and that isnt a problem (but probably will be) 

That being said growing up fighting has lead to a very uncomfortable feeling when being touched. My friends know that is a boundary and respect it.

But my girlfriend doesnt like that I dont want her to touch me. She knows i love her to death but she thinks its different. I would hug my own mother right? Yes (reluctantly) but she is pretty much the only person that I will.

I look past accidents and first time offences like people wouldnt be expected to know.

But am I the asshole? She knows I love her but she says contact is a form of affection and she is saddened that I wont accept or return it. Ive tried explaining it to her and she just doesnt understand.

I dont particularly think she is an asshole at all, but am I the asshole?"
60o9zu,,"Need an unbiased opinion as possible(may not be possible since im the one writing this). So i am a bit lazy, procrastinator, sleeps in sometimes etc. But i do my part with housework, cooks, vacuums, comforts and listen to her when my dad yells and goes off on her (he is bipolar so its hard sometimes). But i get most of the rage from her and if i dont do something a day i will get 2 hour of yelling. I am supposed to pay rent for living at home, but i dont have enough income to pay since i have a car and pay for phone bill and some of my clothes myself.

But the thing that ticks me the most off is when i get shit for not doing anything at home or dont consider her feelings or admit my own faults. But when i do it switches to why dont you have a second job. Why do you not care about me. 

For example today i overslept for school today. And when i got home she looked at me like i was her mother. Who kicked her out and told all her friends she was insane. I started talking to her and apologized for oversleeping and tried to make it better. But she suddenly got mad i had not started the dishwasher (i was home 20 minutes before her) and she demanded i started cooking food everyday and cleaning the house everyday and things like that. 

For info i am 20 years old and trying to save up for an apartment which is hard where i live since it costs a shit ton of money.

Edit 2: badly formulated post. And i realize i have to grow up and take responsibility for my own goddamn problems."
60q2o6,,"I messaged a friend on Facebook saying I'm meeting a girl soon. A few messages later, he asked me if I knew everything about STD's, I said yeah and that I'll be wearing a condom.

Then he asked me if I knew how things spread, Chlamydia in particular. I said I'd be wearing a condom and then he said ""you didn't answer the question"". I explained quickly and then said ""you're talking to a biologist"" (I'm studying biology).

After that he got really irritated. Said stuff like ""you're not a fucking biologist"", ""you're a student, you're studying biology"". After that he said ""you can never give yourself a status, NEVER. Only people around you can"", ""if you say that you're cool, you're not cool. If your teacher gives you a diploma that says you're a biologist, then you're a biologist"". ""You can not call yourself a biologist if you're only studying it"".

He started making comparisons like saying he's a neurosurgeon because he saw a YouTube video and whatever. I said I thought he was overreacting, to which he replied ""no, that's how it works"".

I said that ""biologist"" isn't a protected title, to which he replied ""oh, then I'm a biologist too"". 

I left a very tiny part of our conversation out, but he ended saying that my logic was stupid.

The reason I said I was a biologist was because I didn't feel like he needed to ask me questions about STDs. I did not anticipate his reaction to what I thought was a pretty harmless statement. My point was that I'm studying biology, so I know that stuff. I felt like he was underestimating me.

Did he go too far? Am I the asshole? Are we both assholes?

I shared this experience with another friend of mine, he said it was pretty douchy of me to call myself a biologist when I'm not. We're still talking, so I won't share that whole thing.

I realise this is the tiniest argument and that it doesn't really matter, but I'd like to know if I was a jerk or if I said something stupid.

612f22,,"I work at a daycare. There's this kid there who's a good kid. He's 3, so of course he's a handful and he does get in trouble. But all things considered he's a good kid. And his mom is friendly and awesome. So the other day mom came to pick her kid up. She asked about his day and I made sure to tell her that he had a good day, played well with other kids, and that he's just a good kid in general. I tried my best to make it clear that I like him and honestly think he's well behaved. In the middle of the positive things I told her that he has a bit of a problem saying ""please"". She told me they were working on that at home. I told her that he says please to all the other staff members (who have been there for years while I've only been there a few months) except me. We both chuckled about that and she smiled, so I assumed all was well.

Today she went to my boss and complained about it. She said she felt like she was being attacked and it hurt her as a parent. So my boss talked to all of us staff about it. I talked to my boss privately afterwords and told her that I thought I had done everything right. She said I probably did, but some parents are just sensitive. She said from now on we have to bury the negatives even further.

I'm furious. If I were a parent, I would want to know the truth about my child, both good and bad. In all reality, the kid didn't have a great day. He got in trouble a lot. So I already lied to the mom, but now I have to lie even more just so she won't cry over it. I hate lying to these parents, but we have to do it all the time. It goes against my morals and I feel terrible for some of these kids because they're gonna grow up to be spoiled brats.

Sorry for the wall of text and the ranting. But in all seriousness, am I the asshole here?"

He convinced me to move to this city and to be his neighbor but after a few months of being here, I feel like I'm the bugging annoying friend that constantly annoys. What is even worst is I expressed concern about leaving my previous social circle to move here, but he said ""oh, i'll just introduce you to my circle"" and this hasn't happened, and it gets awkward when they come back from the bars/parties and we (wife and I) were not invited, and we also don't know anyone here.
  
  
(and for the record, he convinced me to make the move mostly because of the job market and for what I do, its an amazing market).

I play by ear and this by no means I'm good with sight reading because I'm not. She finished playing her songs for the day, and asked me if I want to try, seeing that this would be fun I said sure. I pick the 12 Bar Blues near the back of the book, I didn't see this as a problem, but she made it obvious it was. Why do you always want to play the difficult stuff, why not start with something simple? she asked. I say because that's how I am and also it was what I wanted to learn. Okay she replied and we start. (A little extra information: I used to sight read when I played the saxophone and I struggled with playing notes below the staff even when knowing the notes just repeat.) I'm getting notes wrong left and right shes saying ""wrong"" ""what?"" ""that's not right"" as I'm struggling to play, you know not really helping but just making it more frustrating. I say I don't want to play anymore. She gets upset and as usual goes straight to her social media, I'm upset now cause instead of talking to me about it she's on Facebook and Snapchat.

61bb3i,,"Update: Thank you so much for the responses! I went and apologized to dad for being an ass. Mom's already in bed, so I'll talk to her tomorrow.

I (M20) live at my parents' house, and my mom usually drives me to uni (she works nearby). The last two days I overslept, and my mom had to wait for me to get ready (10-15 minutes). I often have problems getting up in the morning, but I'm hardly ever late by more than a minute or so, and I've started getting up at 7 am every school day to try and get a more stable circadian rhythm.

This morning I heard my parents talking about my problems getting up in the morning while putting my clothes on, saying things like ""I don't know what we should do with him"", ""Maybe we should cut his internet at night"", etc. and I just got irrationally angry about it. I felt really disrespected, like, why couldn't they talk to me directly, or at least make an effort to talk about it at a time where I couldn't hear them? I know this doesn't really qualify as talking behind my back - it's not like they were talking shit - but I had just gotten out of bed, and ended up getting quite angry.

Anyway, I went into the kitchen and started making my breakfast, and said ""Maybe you could talk *to* me instead of *about* me?"" to my parents. Later, in the car, I explained to my mom why it had made me so mad, and while I was raising my voice quite a bit, I think she could see where I was coming from. We agreed to discuss the oversleeping thing after we get home.

When I got home I sat down with my parents, and my dad and I got pretty mad at each other. I told him the same thing I've told you, that I felt disrespected, yada yada, and he called me disrespectful for living at their place and messing up their daily schedule. I can definitely see where he's coming from, but he wouldn't agree that what they did was disrespectful in the slightest and said that it wouldn't even have happened if I had just got out of bed on time, and that, again, made me furious.

61bkt8,,"So there is this rule in the squashing sport where if you fail your serve the opponent gets an extra point. Since me and my partner both kept giving away easy points like this, I proposed we should both get an extra try if we fail our serve.


Now my partner being an absolute badass he said he'd only accept this if only I get an extra try because he's fine with the rule. I don't want this as I still want the sport to be fair.


Here is why I thought we should change it:

- We are only amateurs, we don't have to abide to every single rule in the game.
- Since my partner wanted a challenge and I usually fail more serves than him he'd be getting less points this way forcing him to get more points through a good performance.
- I don't want ""a helping hand"" as he described it by only changing the rule for me. 


Here's why he wanted to keep the rule""

- More of a challenge. He's too good so he doesn't need a change.
- He's so good he'd be fine for the change only to apply to me.
- He describes himself as a ""semi-pro""...


Typing this out makes it sound like I'm biased but I'm pretty sure those were his only points. It's completely reasonable for him to want the rule not to change but claiming because it would be more of a challenge is bullshit. Thanks for reading."

I'm 19/m, left highschool - looking for a job, living with my mom and grandparents in Czechia...

Grandpa has had a lot of finnancial problems, kept getting loans  to pay loans and shit... When we've found out my mom (works at a bank) did  everything she could to help... kept track of everything, called all the advertising companies to stop botehering us, sold every useless thing we've had and used every extra money  to help and pay off the loans one after other so grandparents would be able to live from their own income later on...

Well... one day, out of the blue - grandpa takes bunch of asians tru my room and our part of the house, showing them around... He's selling the house. Later we found out he's been getting more loans while we were trying to fix his shit up.

Now, we dont have shit, no money saved up, grandma is getting divorced with him and we're looking for a place to live - but nobody really knows what to do - mom was mentally broken two years ago and now shes hit the bottom of that pit... 

Today I was told I need to donate like 500€/mo so we would be able to keep going and that she'll kick me out othervise...
I know they'll miss that money I could provide, and I know she will be on her own (or with grandma), depressed, full of suicidual toughts in a small flat with our 2 dogs, working 8 hours a day...

In speech, we are doing this relationship elevator model thing where we detail a relationship that ascended, and then descended to put it bluntly. It started with pre-interaction awareness, went up to intimacy, and ended on seperation, and subsequent Post-interaction to sum up the model. Anyway, mine took me 6 hours and ended up being 11 pages long (not double spaced). I literally detailed our whole relationship from when we met, became best friends, started dating, and then broke up. I was pretty proud of this, and my friend Sarah, who was in Speech last semester and did this assignment but shared it with the friend group wanted to read it when I said that I was doing it in our group chat and that it was really helping. After that, everyone else in the group wanted to see it, so I just let them all read it too. I took out all of the personal details that might make her uncomfortable that other people know that she pretty much has only told me before I did though. Anyway, I let her read it too and I guess she was under the impression that she was the only one who read it because she got pissed when I told her I let all of my friends read it. I tried to talk to her today (Friday) to give her a drawing she drew that I still had and she told me not to talk to her, so I just gave her the drawing and she immediately threw it away. My friend told me the next period that she asked him if he had read it and he said that he did and she said that was weird that I was letting so many people read it (really only like 10 people at the VERY greatest including her).

Anyways I got back to the theater and I saw a guy and a manager talking and walking into the theater I was just minding my business but the guy was really talking to him saying stuff like ""why would they fucking do that"" and ""That person is just shitty"" he said a few more things but I didnt catch it. I heard the manager say ""dont worry ill talk to them when they get back"" then it dawned on me, that guy was complaining cuz I sat in the handicapped section. I spoke up and said ""oh you guys are talking about me"" the guy looks right at me and the manager says ""im sorry sir do you mind moving"" I said yes and apologized about sitting in the wrong section. I looked over and that guy had a dude in a wheelchair there.

Oftentimes when I'm with others, I'll kick people out of the room if they're by themselves and I'll cite this rule. I've been kicked out before, and I don't mind. As I said, the rules explicitly say its ok to use it if you're alone, but you have to leave when a group shows up. 

This morning, one guy gave my girlfriend and I a real hard time about it (calling me a fucking asshole and a whole slew of other things). He was waiting for a group, and told me to wait until his group members showed up. He ended up leaving, but not before cursing at me from across the floor.

61jsuh,,"I posted this in r/relationships and was redirected to this sub. I'm a noob so forgive me.

I've been with my partner for 6 years and I think she's perfect for me but I feel like my personality is not conducive to a healthy relationship.

On paper we seem perfect. We're both professionals making decent money. I work hard on our financial ventures and she works hard making sure we're both fed and clothed. 

I love everything about her and she seems to accept me for all I am, warts and all (figuratively!). My libido is always in overdrive and she indulges me even when she doesn't feel the same. All for my happiness.

I treat her as my princess and everything I do is so that she can have the life she deserves.

Here's where I am worried that I might not be very healthy for her or even anyone. I think I'm needy and insecure.

I just want to be with her all the time. I get jealous and protective when she's out with friends, worried that something will happen to her or she will cheat on me even though she has done nothing to suggest that.

I feel insecure that she enjoys the company of her friends more than with me because I am boring, an indoors person, and a super shy introvert. I feel insecure that if a situation came up where she had to make a choice between me or her friends, that I wouldn't like the result.

Recently her friend who is an acquaintance of  mine invited her to his wedding and not me. I felt hurt that she didn't boycott and just not go but on the other hand I feel like I'm overreacting. 

I am worried that she's just with me because:

* Sunk cost fallacy
* For all intents and purposes we look great on paper
* This is her first and only ever relationship and she is afraid of what is out there.
* We will most likely have a stable financial future and I'm decent looking so she's settled.

It's been a bit therapeutic writing all this out.

Then i just think I've won. Now I don't know if i'm just addicted to getting girls to like me, but after that I slowly just stop talking/hanging out with them and find a new girl rinse and repeat. Am I an asshole for not going any further in a relationship with a girl?"
61ssu6,,"That's a super dramatic title, but I couldn't think of a better way to word it. I'm a bit unsure at the moment whether I handled everything in a mature fashion, and I feel like I need some advice on what I could/should *actually* do now. I am aware that this isn't the perfect subreddit for this, but I don't want to spam it on previous subreddits that the topic has been buried in. So I guess for this one I want to ask whether I'm an asshole for handling this immaturely.

Full story:

I started a program and became friends with a girl. We hung out a lot. I asked her out and she started, at least from my POV, avoiding me. This made me extremely upset (I don't want to say depressed because I've never been clinically depressed) and I ended up quitting the program. We did talk the last few days (and admittedly talked a bit even after that, but she did mainly ignore me and it felt awkward), and I told her that I was quitting because I wasn't a fan of the program. 

This is almost 6 months later, and a couple of months ago I removed her from Facebook after just hiding her updates, because they did make me upset just remembering her (well, I'm not sad, I just don't want to be reminded). I was upset for a solid two or three months after quitting, as well as a couple of weeks before doing so.

Now, to me it's almost obvious that I shouldn't have said anything. She did nothing wrong by turning me down and ignoring me, despite the fact that we were friends, I'm sure she didn't even notice me just removing her, and she should not be subject to my depression that's completely mine to deal with.

It's definitely too late now to write a message. I feel like that would be creepy and out of nowhere and make her feel anxiety that she has no reason to feel. But I never told her that I got upset that she avoided me. I talked to my friends about it, never said anything to her. Should I have said something to her or did I do the right thing not telling her the truth?

61u8b6,,"This is quite a long one, it's taken quite an emotional toll on me - haven't been able to do nothing but brood over this.

I've had a sour ending with a childhood friend, 10 years of friendship.

I come from a fucked up family where one parent leaves and comes back with my siblings, and then the other leaves and alternate. 3 years ago however, one of them ended up in jail and the other one left with my siblings - thus I was alone to fend for myself. I never use to choose sides, but this time I did and I chose to side with the parent in jail. Other parent decided that they did not like this, and that they'll try everything in their power to make me homeless (I'm male, at the time 16) so I ended up staying at this house, that house, and sometimes even on the street.

Best friend (call him John) at this time was there for shits a giggles, and I appreciate that, but he wasn't there at all emotionally whatsoever, nor did I expect him to be. So you know, I didn't care, I strut my own game and did what I had to do with the parent bullshit, and he was there for a laugh.

After parent comes out of jail, they decided to get back together again, and this time I had enough so I left the country to live with other family. I had to move away from everything, this was the place I grew up in and of course, because I was the one leaving the parents, the parent that tried making me homeless blamed everything squarely on me. (Funnily enough, they've broken up again).

John told me he's gonna miss me and all that, but it all felt forced. Anyway, I didn't care. In the last 2 years I've been back to that country and met him. Shits and giggles like the usual.

Last year, however, he started chatting shit about how I'm being dickhead to my mother and I need to straighten up. And he said it multiple times - so I'm shook at how a dude who I grew up with cannot empathise with the fact that I went to hell and back because of my mother, and that had me doubting myself for days.

621p5y,,"So my boyfriend and I just had an argument... well, I say argument, he gave me the silent treatment before eventually admitting he was mad at me (which he knows full well upsets me more than yelling), but that's besides the point. 

He says he's mad at me because he's sick of ""having to do everything"" around the house. Which -is- technically true, but I think he's ignoring some key points:

A) I never ask him to do any housework - he does it because he prefers a tidier house than I do (he likes a clear sink, I'm happy to let the few dishes we use stay 'til the weekend, etc.). Plus, he never asks me to do any chores for him before just going ahead and doing them anyway (and usually rejecting my help when I offer it because I don't do things fast enough or thoroughly enough for him).

And B), he doesn't work or contribute to the bills at all, whilst I work a stressful job all day and don't usually get back until late evening. He's not a student either, though he's planning to go back to education soon-ish. I don't want to say that obligates him to do more chores, and I wouldn't dream of forcing him to 'earn his keep', but it feels like he expects me to both work and do all the chores for him while he plays his game for 30 hrs straight. 

With those points in mind, I don't feel like he's justified in getting mad at me. But he's still sitting in the other room ignoring me and making me feel like a shit girlfriend, so I don't know. Am I the asshole here?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's mad at me because he's ""sick of having to do everything"" around the house. However, I never ask him to do any chores, and he neither works, studies or pays anything towards bills. Am I the asshole for thinking he's not justified in being mad at me?"
622p7s,,"A bit of context, I'm currently in highschool and my brother is in University. We're both PC enthusiasts but he also spends long hours studying. In the past, while staying with our dad, we both got some hand-me-down office chairs that were, to put it frankly, beat to shit and not very good. They were uncomfortable and very bad for both my brother's and my backs.

At our mom's, however, which we recently moved back to, I have a much better office chair which is adjustable in several ways, most notably, the actual seat of the chair can be tilted forward or backward. My brother is exceptionally tall and needs a range of adjustment, otherwise he gets back pain or his legs fall asleep. 

My brother has asked me to switch chairs, and I did refuse, but assured him there was room for consideration. I just was not prone to do so at the time. 

Recently, while I was sleeping, my brother took my chair from the basement and replaced it with his, either not expecting me to notice or not expecting me to care. I did notice, and care. This made me quite livid, which I believe is fairly understandable, as he instead of asking me again decided to go behind my back. I understand my brother needs the chair, but now I feel less inclined to give it to him.

My brother has the means to get a chair of his own. Our mom would likely be very supportive of buying or giving him one more suited to his needs, and he is far from being broke himself. This has been my chair for a very long time and it frustrates me that he would rather just take mine than get another. This is also after he stole shelves from my room, which I decided to let go.

My brother however has started to make petty threats, like saying he'll take his room back (I'm currently in his old room, he moved to a different one) among others. I understand that this would help my brother; however the manner in which he's handled this has made me less inclined to give it to him. Pardon the wall of text, but Am I The Asshole?

**TL;DR: B"
626py1,,"I'm vehemently opposed to homeopathy but my mother seriously believes, err, believed in it. She has a lot of friends who support it and is friends with homeopaths. She would frequently ask me to take it anytime I got sick. It's not like she disregarded western medicine. I always had to take antibiotics alongside her homeopathy. I'd expressed the fact that I didn't believe in it before to no avail. So I told her if she ever made me take it again I wouldn't forgive her for it. That she was forcing me to disrespect my own beliefs. 

She respected that, to a degree. She no longer made me take it but she would still buy it for me and ask me over and over to take it just for her. I told her if she ever provided me with any proof that it worked I would take it. That was a mistake. 

She kept coming to me with anecdotal evidence and I had to explain that it was bullshit evidence each time. I got really fed up one day and said it was bullshit and that by supporting it she is helping to create an anti-science culture and that all her homeopath friends are either charlatans or idiots and that by supporting it she was no better than they are. I was pretty riled up and I obviously hurt her feelings but I also think I proved my point. She hasn't offered me homeopathy in months. 

It was something she truly believed in and I systematically dumped all over it. I felt like she pushed into doing it and also like I had a duty to show her it was bullshit because I believe wholeheartedly that believing in that shit is dangerous."

62gl2e,,"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, but his mother and I sometimes have trouble getting along. She speaks English very well, because she's lived in the States for the past ten years. She's originally from Chile and speaks Spanish as her mother tongue. 

Up till now she's always tried her best not to speak in Spanish in front of me whenever I was around, which is unnatural for her since she exclusively speaks in Spanish with her son. She must've gotten mad at me for something again, because the last time I was at their place, she completely ignored me and spoke to her son only in Spanish. The same thing happened yesterday. 

Her behavior makes me feel like she's not acknowledging my presence and she's doing it out of spite, because she usually gets mad at me and I would have no idea. For example, she admitted to my boyfriend that she conscientiously ignored me on my birthday because I forgot to wish her a good flight one time. This happens relatively often, and I'm wondering if this is just one of her petty behaviors. 

On the other hand, maybe she just doesn't have the patience anymore to translate the stuff she has to say to her son, because she's getting old and going through menopause and has rheumatoid arthritis, which she tends to blame a lot of her behaviors on. Maybe I'm being too sensitive and I should just brush it off. 

My boyfriend brought the issue up with her already and she denies doing it completely, so I don't know how to solve this small problem.

62h57y,,"A family friend has been staying in my house for a while now, one that's known my mother for many years. She (the guest) suffers from chronic fatigue, meaning she sleeps for an extra few hours each night and can only really commit to a few things to accomplish each day. My frustration with her comes indirectly from her condition, because it's resulted in her being very socially inept. She'll often comment on things that she really has no authority on as well as generally question things unnecessarily. Additionally, IMO she's quite manipulative, saying things like ""I can leave any time you want"" or ""you don't have to help me if it's inconvenient"", knowing full well how much of an asshole I would at the very least feel like if I were to turn her down.

She said ""you took a bite out of my ice cream"", to which I replied ""well i payed for it"".

62juuv,,I had a beautiful baby son 6 months ago. I have always wanted to experience pregnancy and childbirth as well as breastfeeding and having my own child. A childfree facebook friend posted a status about how it's narcissistic to have bio children while the world is already too full and millions of kids go unadopted every day. I felt like my human right to experience what my female body is capable is not a narcissistic thing. I personally believe that me having my own beautiful son and there being children to adopt are unrelated issues. Am I being narcissistic?  
62lob8,,"So my boyfriend and i live together. Today he got home from work at 2pm and started playing games on his computer. I have no problems with this. I know it's his hoby and it gives me a chance to do my own thing as well. 
However, the only thing i ask when it comes to the games is that our commitments come first. 

One of his friends who he hasn't seen in ages is coming to visit tomorrow and we have made plans to spend the day together. It's currently 1am and my boyfriend has been paying for 11 hours straight. I even took his dinner to him so he didn't have to leave his desk.

I feel like i have been super lenient and given him tons of space but i know if he keeps playing he won't get enough sleep and will be tired and grumpy and change the tone of our day. This is something that has happebed before. I know its his life and his game but I'm the one that had to live with him when he's tired, snappy and not as much fun to be around. He is the one that has organised tomorrow so am I the asshole for wanting him to get to bed for the sake of my own enjoyment?

Note: i haven't said anything to him yet. Just told him that it was close to 1am as he doesn't always realize what time it is. Im just lying in bed feeling annoyed. 

tldr: my boyfriend made plans both of us to hang with his friends tomorrow morning and is staying up all the night before to game.

Edit: thanks so much for the replys guys. All advice has been taken on board and we did have a talk about how i felt. This is the best sub!"

Next minute the neighbour rocks up and starts chatting to my dad for about 20 minutes. I'm making breakfast, but my dad wants to send me over to the neighbours place with a USB to print off some files for him. I'm like, Dad, what the fuck, my whole day is gone now, (I won't be able to get away from him) so I put the files on the USB and tell him to go over.


I instantly feel bad, so I offer to come over with him to try and get him out of the neighbours place. My kindness was rejected with a swift, ""Oh cool, you can go over then. I don't know how to use the USB anyway""


So then it's back on me. I didn't want to spend 4 hours of my only day off in two bloody weeks in my neighbours place talking about his third grandson's nephew's best friend, so I packed a sad and told my dad I didn't want to waste my time there.

Now I feel like an asshole, because it's already been an hour and I can hear him talking from here.


Am I the asshole here? Because I feel like one, but thinking about it, it's my dad's files, not mine. It's my only day off in two weeks. I offered to go over with him, and he instantly screwed me over. :') Gahh help pls."

3v30mo,,"I'll get right to the point: my girlfriend's father died. The whole situation and the way/time it happened was just completely awful. She felt like she couldn't even move that day because of how horrible she felt. 

Later on, she asked me if I would go to the funeral with her, even though it's far away. I said of course I would, I want to be there to support her. 

So I tell my mom while I'm driving her to work that I'm going to be gone friday and be back sunday. She immediately reminds me that my cousins have a dance recital over the weekend, and I'm being a little selfish for not going to see them, because ""you have a family, too."" 

So I kind of just sit there not sure what to say. I told her I love my cousins and I love watching them do what they do well, but that I think a person dying is more important than a dance. Then she says if I HAVE to go, I need to at least find them presents while I'm out of town. Something cooky and crazy they couldn't find at home, because she's sure we'll come across lots of weird stores.

I just sat there in silence. I got so fucking mad over that. The fact that 1) she did not really react much to my girlfriend's father's death beyond ""oh. that sucks. i'm sorry for her,"" and 2) she makes it seem like I'm going on a fucking road trip! This is not going to be a fun trip! I'm not going to shop all weekend, I'm going to support my girlfriend while she mourns her dead father. 

And when she realized that I was a little pissed with her, she got mad with me. She started getting really passive aggressive and treating me like I was being irrational about the whole thing. 

But am I the asshole for not wanting to get my cousins gifts while I'm away?"
3v40zn,,"She knocked them off of the couch and practically immediately stepped on them accidentally. I saw her a couple days later and mentioned in passing that I need a new pair. She exploded and first claimed she didn't break them, I did. And then later told me how she can't afford to buy me a new pair because she has Christmas shopping to do. 

I mean seriously, I just want a new pair. And obviously if I had the money I would buy some, but I literally have no money at the moment."
3v5a50,,"In this sub, I often see it pronounced by commenters that nothing you think or feel can make you an asshole...and I have no idea what convinces people that this is an incontrovertible rule. 

Sure, in many situations, your initial, internal gut reaction does not make you the asshole as long as you have the presence of mind to overcome your urge to act on it, *and eventually think better of it*.  But thinking the wrong thing can make you an asshole...even if it's difficult for those around you to tell you're an asshole.

For instance, if you personally believe that every minority in the world is stupid, lazy, or violent, but you have learned to keep your mouth shut because people don't react well to you talking about it...you're still an asshole.  If you secretly think your best friend is a pathetic loser and are only hanging out with them until you find something better, you're an asshole now, not just after you drop the bomb.  If you think your Dad is a complete piece of shit because he grounded you for punching your sister, you suck for punching your sister, but you also only think the way you do because you're immature and have a bad attitude; even if you're too scared to act on it, you're at least being a childish jerk by thinking that way.

If a person would have to be an asshole to accept an idea in his mind, he doesn't only become an asshole when he finally breaks down and acts on it.  He's a type of asshole as long as selfish, racist, conceited, or other illegitimate instincts control his thoughts.  Do those of you who espouse the no action/no asshole rule disagree with this?"
3vd8cz,,"Disclaimer: I have not done this yet.
I have one roommate let's call him Jake. When we moved in I brought my tv, ps4, and stereo set up. Initially I had planned to put these in my room for my own enjoyment but when we first moved in they just kind of ended up in the living room. This is okay because usually if I want to use it he's receptive and will let me use the stereo or TV. Sometimes not so much but not enough for it to be an issue. He also does not have a drivers license so this requires me to take him home, to the gym, the store, etc. Usually I don't mind but sometimes I do have to conform to his schedule to do this. Now as far as I'm concerned he doesn't quite give as much (I buy the games, gas, psn subscription, so on and so forth) so would I be an asshole to ask more of him? For example after a night of drinking, we and whoever else we have over, leave the place in a reasonably trashy state. Nothing horrible but certainly not something you want to muck around in all day. Would I be the asshole to ask him to clean up to sort of compensate for our current give/take dynamic? Or just do more chores to compensate. I've been thinking this over and can't decide. Thanks."
3vly8d,,"To the point then with no specific details.

I've been upper level with an online group for over three years, I'm currently one of the most senior members and have been involved from the revitalization to present through all of our projects.

We deal with an ever changing field of topics. We've done card game development, game convention management, and hosted game servers. We've also done plenty of streaming and youtube.

Recently, we've had a sharp drop in community size, as we no longer have any public projects retaining or bringing in new members. Wehosted a Teamspeak server for over a year, but recently switched to Discord.

Teamspeak 3 and Discord are Voice over IP programs, used to communicate with each other, as well as leave plenty of space for community members to hang out and do whatever. The community is sort of split between a main group consisting of fans for streams and content, and my sub-group which is a slightly older gang of friends that have ended up here for one reason or another over the years. In our current state, I don't do much for the group besides moderate the Discord and deal with my own side business.

**Here's the important Part:**
Recently, I've had lots of trouble from one member of the main group. Spamming, posting NSFW content, ect. After warning him multiple times, he and three friends decided it would be funny to spam the hell out of the chat channels. In discord, chat channels are all public and you are by default notified of chat messages, which appear as desktop notifications. I got on and saw the absolute mess, with a few messages asking them to stop, no dice.

I do my job and remove the main issue from the server permanantly. I then remove the other three for the remainder of the day. As I usually do, I left messages in the admin chat explaining that I had removed them.

Later in the night owner (my boss) hopped on and told me off for eviscerating the remains of the community. I insist that without a community project, we ca"
3vozl7,,"That is all. 

I was briefly sort of seeing a girl. It was an extremely weird relationship because we never talked to each other before midnight and nobody saw us together. ""We"" did not exist. We randomly met one night and formed an emotional bond. We subsequently started hooking up but she wanted a relationship before sex and quite frankly I was not emotionally read for that so we just agreed to keep things low energy. I think she still wanted to hook up regardless of our relationship status because she kept pressuring for it at later points. She became way too demanding and one night she blew up at me when she came home from a break early and abruptly showed up to my room. I was way too fucked up to properly spend time with her and quite frankly all I wanted to do was play Project M, which is a mod for Super Smash Bros. I told her this and she then assaulted me verbally and left. 

One of my friends came back two days later to pick up his controllers  and I guess he put two and two together. I never sleep with pillows and all of her pillows were on my bed so he deduced what had happened because he is friends with her roommate and spends quite a lot of time in their room. When I told him what had happened, he was unsurprisingly shocked and kind of insulted me. He told some people in our friends group and now they are giving me a ton of shit. One guy I dislike also said something about how I'm a ""pussy [n word]"" for choosing the joy stick over giving joy to girls with my dick (hehehe). So basically now everyone thinks I am a dick for somehow leading this girl on and disrespecting her in the ultimate way by choosing a joystick over my dick. 

So yeah guys, I prefer Smashing to fucking. Deal with it. I have to study for a stupid Psych test but fuck that. I'm going to Smash. But first I gotta know this: am I the asshole in this situation? I may be an asshole overall, but I don't think I'm doucho numero uno in this situation-o. "

3vsk81,,"First off I need to point out that my question is purely about my actions of the other night. I know that up until that point I was very much the asshole for going along with it, but am I the asshole telling him that I want to stop?

I also want to point out that I'm very very much against cheating, I've never cheated and have never been with another mans SO. Well my best friend has been doing just that with his ex and his wife. Several times he’s made me claim that he was hanging out with me when in fact he was over his ex’s house. His wife is not stupid and can tell that he’s lying but she trusts me enough that when I say that he’s with me she believes it. The marriage is falling apart and has been since the beginning. They went from meeting to engaged to pregnant to married in the space of about 2 months and every step of the way I was urging them to slow down. At this point they hate each other and are both miserable and there exists no trust. That being said she, at least seems, to be trying a tiny bit harder. 

Well he’s still in love with his ex (who also happens to be the mother of his first child) and is biding his time before he leaves his wife for her. At this point he admits that he’s only around to help take care of the new born but will be leaving very soon. He’ll still help take care of her and will seek split custody. 

Ok so the other night he’d gotten me to lie again that we were running an errand while he really went to see her again and “Talk”. Later when I went to pick him up from her house I told him that I did not want to help with that anymore. I don’t want to lie for him, I don’t want to drive him to her house I don’t even want to know what’s happening. I may not respect either of them anymore but I need to try to regain some of the self-respect I lost while helping him.

We came home at 2am and although we tried to be quiet we were a little loud and unfortunately woke Clare up as we were going up the stairs (so approximately 1-2 minutes of disturbance total). She didn't say anything at the time, but sent a text the following day saying she was pissed off. 

Jenny and I felt really bad about it so we made her dinner when she got home, said we were very sorry and that if there was a next time we would try to be more respectful. I also said that if we were ever too loud she could text one of us and we would shut up. She was still pissed, so we cleaned the whole house and have kept apologising.

When the party was over and I was at home, I drunkenly saved the numbers over the wrong name. (Saved Sarah's as Aimee's cousin's name and vice versa).
I was texting Sarah, but I thought it was Aimee's cousin. I told her that I think I like Aimee again. (The exact text: **""I dunno I think I kinda like her again xxxx""**) NOTE: I specifically told Sarah ""DO NOT TELL ANYONE"" because shit spreads quickly and the information always gets mixed up.
and I told her this because: a) I wanted to tell somebody, and Jess was asleep at the time. b) It's Aimee's cousin, I kinda wanted her to get kind of an idea.

Well, I got a text through in the morning by Jess (Text: **Did you lie to me when you said you didn't like *Aimee*? X""**, she claimed that she was going down Sarah's phone but later admitted Sarah showed her.
And apparently I told her before the party some days ago that I wanted to have sex with her, which I think I did. (stupidly) and then Jess starts telling me I don't have to lie to her because she's my best friend, getting annoyed because I told Sarah (Thinking it was Aimee's cousin) before her, which my response was **""Yeah doesn't mean I have to tell you who I like? I was gonna tell you but I don't know if I like"

3w1omc,,"Earlier tonight, I finished a video that I'd been working on with a friend for a long time, and she and I were both really excited about the way it turned out. We sent it around to a few test subjects, including several strangers, all of whom had very positive responses to it. I sent it to my boyfriend as well, and he laughed louder than almost anyone else. My boyfriend, my friend, and I then ended up at dinner together, and I was preparing to upload the video to my website. My boyfriend was acting play-annoyed at me, because I asked him ""Do you like it? Do you like it?"" over and over (also as a joke), and he, of course, kept responding yes. Then, my friend mentioned something about how we needed to know if my bf ""liked it or loved it,"" because we'd only put it up if he loved it (this was also a joke on the part of my friend). So, I asked in the same playful tone, ""Do you love it?"" And my boyfriend tensed up, started acting really uncomfortable, and said ""I... really like it."" I could tell this wasn't a joke, but to avoid embarrassment for the both of us, I laughed it off like it was one just in front of my friend.

When she left, I asked him why he didn't say he loved it. He responded that he just doesn't usually describe things with that particular wording. This was news to me--he's often excessively affectionate, we've been together for 3.5 years, and he actually told me he loved me on our first date. I tried to tease the answer out of him, but he really seemed uncomfortable with the very prospect of saying it, and couldn't really explain to me why, so I stopped. I am, however, a little confused, and a little hurt. He does game design, and I'm constantly telling him how much I love his work--my Facebook is plastered with articles and links about him, so I know I've used the word ""love"" specifically several times to describe it. I wish he would say the same for me and mine. I know actions speak louder than words, yadda yadda yadda, but this particular word matters"
3w1y2z,,"Sorry this is so long. This just happened.

My wife occasionally gets sad/down, and when that happens, she deactivates her facebook. Always a temporary delete, she always comes back.

She just reactivated it after about 8-10 days ""off."" We see that two of our very close friends (another husband and wife, let's say Susie and Kevin) are no longer her friend on there. They don't show up in ""mutual"" when I look at her friends - nothing. She **definitely** did not unfriend them, we know that for a fact. 

Today Kevin, who also works with me, implied that my wife had unfriended and blocked them both. Nope, I told him, she just had her shit turned off for about a week or so. Well, fact - she was not friends with either him or Susie. (No idea if facebook would unfriend only some people during a deactivation, and if so, *those exact two people?*). It seems beyond coincidental. We find it hard to come to any other conclusion except that they must have both defriended her during the deactivation.

We presume that they both defriended her, but we can't prove this, and certainly wouldn't make the accusation. If they want to tell us that's what they did, fine. I don't really give a fuck about facebook, but I do very much give a fuck about people treating my wife fairly. 

Concurrent with all this, my wife sent Susie a text, and vice versa. Both show delivered on the other's phone, yet neither received the other's message. A double-drop, if you will. Between two iPhones.

Kevin seems to be certain that my wife blocked them both, and that she was intentionally not responding to text messages. He thinks that Apple's ""Delivered"" notification is gospel.

I replied that I knew for certain my wife didn't block them, and explained her account deactivation, and that I didn't know what was up with the texts, but I'm sure a hug-fest could sort it out. He replied that Susie had a lot of pride and ""wouldn't be the first one to the peace table.""

3w3080,,"My mom has a thing about making sure all gifts at least appear equal. She does a lot more for my sister all year long because my sister and her husband are not financially stable. I am concerned about my parents not retiring, but otherwise, I look at it as none of my business. My parents do a ton for my kids, which I am very grateful for and that as my kids are my world.

Anyways, my mom made it a point to sit down with me and have me pick out some stuff I would like for Christmas. I picked out a few things, including these really pretty long scarfs. She asked if I thought my sister would like them, but both agreed they weren't her style. When they came in, my mom showed me because they were even nicer than we imagined. Yesterday, she calls and says she worries my gifts look like more than my sister's even though she is getting my sister a washing machine. She asks if she can give her one of my gifts. I say sure. Then she tells me she wants to give her one of my two scarfs. I am taken back by this. I was really excited for these, hand picked them and my sister will never wear them and I will. 

It hit a nerve. My sister was always the favorite growing up and my parents had no issue taking from me to give to her. My grandpa (who has since passed) used to hate it and would get me stuff that my sister stole from me if it was something I loved/needed (this happened a few times). It really hurt because it felt like she was taking from me to please my sister again. I wouldn't care if it were almost any other gift, but I am so excited about these damn scarfs. I did tell her it bothered me and she agreed not to do it.

I feel like I was acting like a spoiled brat. I have so much and I am very fortunate. This just brough up a lot of issues for me. It really hurt. She knew I was excited for these to the point I was planning on wearing them as soon as I unwrapped them on Christmas morning as part of my outfit.

3w9d80,,"My SOs friend is planning a strip club bday party this Saturday, the same night as my work Christmas party. I really didn't give a shit about him going out to party, but I just found out its hosted at a strip club. I have told my SO in the past that its not something I'm  okay with and its a dealbreaker to me. I don't care if the bday guy is married and has kids, and I'm sorry if I offend any strippers reading this but Im totally not cool with that. To me, going to a club like that while in a relationship might as well be cheating if you're getting tits in your face and shit. Sooo basically, I'm looking like a huge piece of shit asshole right now and were fighting because of this."
3wb3zr,,"About two months ago, I wound up way too drunk at a bar and was taken advantage of by a person I had met that same night. One of my friends kicked them out of my room and she's basically helped me avoid that person ever since (hard to do, at the same uni!) Thing is, I didn't report my assault because 1) I was ashamed of getting that drunk and letting myself get into a situation that dangerous and 2) my friend pulled them off me and kicked them out before they did anything really bad, so I didn't feel like I had much to report. Didn't tell more than a few friends, definitely didn't report it to an authority figure. 

Cut ahead to an event hosted by the uni, now about two weeks ago. Hosted at a night club, there is obviously drinking involved. I saw a different friend (who I had never told) with the same person who assaulted me and flipped -- basically just bailed on the situation and vanished to be alone for awhile. Avoided the two of them for the rest of the night. I asked a friend who knew the full story if she thought I should intervene, and she told me it was fine, because my now at risk friend looked super into it and the two of them were out in public, so nothing would happen. Really great friend right here, leaving someone in exactly the same situation that put me in danger, right? But I didn't want to approach my assaulter / over react if it turned out to be harmless so I left it alone. 

Well, the next day, I heard that basically, my friend had to repeatedly try and get rid of the asshole. They kept coming back, backing my friend into a corner and needing to be pushed off repeatedly. My friend was way less drunk than I was and things didn't escalate as much, but they were still very (obviously) shaken up about the whole situation. I went straight to my friend to apologize and told them what had happened to me, and then asked if they wanted to make a formal report with me, because it was clear that the asshole was not going to stop. I mean, it has become a re"

3wc1ao,,"I'm taking a film/video production program in college, and my school also has an audio engineering program. We have a recording studio which is mainly used by the audio engineering students, but is also available to film/video students for recording things like narration, [dialogue replacement](http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm), sound effects, etc. The studio consists of two separate rooms― a control room where the engineer works and a live room where the talent performs.

The rooms can be used together, with the engineer in the control room and the talent performing in the live room as in a real recording session. But the live room also contains it's own audio workstation for students working alone, or groups that don't want to use the control room for whatever reason.

The studio is available on a first come, first served basis, unless you've made a reservation with the equipment operator. In other words, you can use the studio without a reservation if no one's in there already, but you have to give it up if someone with a reservation shows up. Because you can record using just one room or with both, the rooms can be booked together or individually.

Recently I went in the control room to copy a project off the computer that I had worked on earlier. I noticed a group in the live room using the separate audio workstation. I needed to record a narration for one of my final assignments and assumed that the group must have a reservation, so I asked the equipment operator when their reservation ended. Surprisingly, he told me they didn't have a reservation.

With no way of knowing when they'd be done, I decided to make the recording in one of the computer labs. Normally the lab used for audio work has a microphone stand lying around, but on this day it was missing and the equipment operator said the stands in the studio shouldn't be moved and he didn't know where I could get one. (Recording mics can't be handheld as they are extremely sensitive and the movement"
3wduqj,,"I'll try to keep it short.

So two weeks ago I got a gas station cashier gig. I put flex hours (can work most times) but they needed me in graveyard - I was cool with it. 

So like two shifts in I'm already noticing there's a completely lack of professional behavior on both sides of the ball (customer service and employee relationships). It all started on our first night - my coworker made a, albeit consequential, mistake. One of the ""senior staffers"" (old fucks who have been cashiering at this gas station for years) took it upon herself to rip this poor girl a new one. The second night ended with me discovering a coworker photographed a simple mistake I made and ""reported"" my shit via messaging group: a group I'm not even in, mind you.

I decided to call my manager to speak to him about what I'd been seeing. He practically dodged me, forcing me to ask him things over the phone. Didn't go well.

It all culminated to the end of my 4th shift. The shift relieving me and my partner cannot open because there aren't enough dollar bills in the tills. So, while customers are lining up to pay for coffee this relief shift is, quite literally, thrashing about shifting blame onto me (I had no idea what I even did), which eventually ended with my manager coming in and saying the same thing.

I'd decided I wanted nothing to do with that store anymore, and quit after my shift. My manager got extremely defensive and said I was the first ""problem employee"" he's ever had: He said I shouldn't use baseless accusations (he wasn't yelling at me directly, just all of us in general!) to justify wanting to just quit. Yech

So am I the asshole here? Is this just the culture of gas station retail, and I should have had the stones to just stick it all out? Let me know~

**edit:** Thank you all for the responses! I guess I'm in the clear, then. Here's to better, non gas-station things in the future! haha."

Me: Yeah, what about it ?

3wmexs,,"Ok so long story short is i'm 16 and i spend lunches at school with my brother and his friend and my teacher told my brother's friend ""thank you for being allthatmace's friend"" i took offense to that because i do have my own friends and it makes it seem like im mentally handicapped and he is doing me a  favor in talking to me"
3wosrc,,"So me and my 4 roommates live in a small house. 4 of us pay 700 for rent, 1 pays 650 for the smallest room. All utilities are covered except internet.
When we first started living here, we agreed we'd split wifi. Yes, I agreed to this too (informally, no written agreement or anything.)


So basically, my number 1 reason for feeling like I shouldn't have to pay is because I basically don't live in the house. I'm literally always at my boyfriend's apartment - I haven't used the internet once. My room is basically a place where I put stuff, on a very rare occasion I sleep there, and about twice a week I'll shower there. I only use my boyfriend's wifi. 

Smaller reasons:
I have the smallest room in the house - it is significantly smaller than  everyone else's. Going into this, I thought the price was 650 for each room (that's what I was told by a roommate.) The day I signed it was 700. I felt pressured to sign it, and I'd already picked my room. I thought the largest room was 675, mine and other two at 650, and the smallest at 625. So basically I feel totally gipped. In fact the reason I'm always at my boyfriend's is because the whole thing makes me feel really resentful of the house itself. Yes, I know it's my fault, but it was my first time signing a lease. Now I know better.


I'm tight on money. I am really struggling to pay these bills. I just don't think I should have to pay for something I don't even use.

But yeah, I know I agreed to pay and technically two of my roommates are my friends. I know it would be dick to cop out of it, but I really do think it's unfair. Opinions?"

She is the kindest person I've ever met, an angel who has never gotten mad. But this time she was too nice.

If we walk around town, I have to already suffer through groups of guys eyeing her like a piece of meat. It hurts me, but there's nothing I can do.

After dinner last night, we walked past a bar with a drunk man sitting by the entrance.

As we walked past him, I hear him yell ""holy shit"" and jog up to her, almost falling, just to grope Wendy's bottom. She was shocked and quickly jumped away; but instead of yelling at him, she laughed it off and just told him she's taken in a flirty tone whilst pointing at me.  

Not angry. Flirty.

I was fucking FUMING. Before I could think to say something she urged me to keep moving.

Back at home, I screamed at Wendy demanding to know why didn't she get angry, she just kept saying ""boys will be boys!"" like its some fucking joke. She even said ""it's a compliment to me.""

While ranting about the drunk fuckhead, she told me to let it go and ""stop making mean comments! he had his moment of fun.""

Am I a dick for getting angry at my girlfriend's lack of anger for what happened? I mean, how many times does she blow this off when I'm NOT around? I'm actually scared to ask her.

How can I tell her the seriousness of this subject? Because to me she is taking it WAY too lightly. If she actually likes having this happen, what is considered going too far?

EDIT: I was wrong. I'm going to apologize and let her know that if she doesn't mind being touched by others it is not something I should get mad or have any say in. I've been a horrible boyfriend."

* The dog was tied up for an hour
* The dog had access to clean water
* The dog is 70 pound lab
* It was 50 degrees and pouring rain but the dog was under cover

Our midwife told us that whooping cough is spreading rapidly in our local area, and that anyone who will be having regular contact with the baby for the first 6 weeks of her life needs to be immunised or get a booster. This is as the baby cannot be immunised for the first 6 weeks of her life.

My girlfriends entire family has agreed to receive boosters for whooping cough. My parents however have told me that they will not. They say that since they were immunised in 2009 that the whooping cough (which covers you for 10 years) vaccine is still valid. I agree with them, but since babies can and do die from whooping cough I am pleading with them to get the booster just to be safe.

After various fights and arguments I have told them that if they refuse to get the booster that they won't be allowed to see the baby until she has her own vaccines.

I've already moved them three times and built a piece of furniture to keep them 4 feet or so off the ground. He refuses to crate or otherwise keep his dog somewhere else during the day. He claims that doing so would be cruel to his dog, and that there's no way of knowing if it is his dog or our dog, who has lived here with the plants for years without incident before he moved in.

I made it very clear that I do like cats (she has two) but that I want 0! responsibility for them and asked how well she takes care of them. Anna agreed to the first thing and said she takes really excellent care of her cats.

                                                                                         

Since then this stuff has happened:   





Cats have escaped on to the street a few times in beginning (dangerous) or up our big stairwell, had to lure/chase them back in many times.  

Cats peed on a neighbours' welcome mat, Anna bought them a new one but took her a while.




Turns out the cats are a bit damaged since their first owner sucked. Not Anna's or cats' fault! But: We had all had quite a lot of nights where we slept like shit because the cats can be very loud and needy right outside my door. In the courtyard they also make quite some penetrating noise. Some of our neighbors love our cats but I am sure some are annoyed as hell by them or at least the noise and crap. We live in a large block with inner courtyard and many young people. At least one young couple with baby dislikes her (us?) now when they did say Hi and acted nice in the beginning. This is according to Anna. This couple happens to get the majority of the cat crap in front of their ground floor apartment since there is some earth there.. 

I have tried to put cats and cat litter box in closed kitchen only for the night, and when we do, 9 out of 10 times cats are chill and quiet and we sleep just fine. Anna has done this sometimes too but is a bit inconsistent, despite me asking if we could always do it since i need my sleep. She likes the cats to be able to walk in and out of her room and bed at night. But her open door is right! next to my closed one and the cats can be really noisy, our doors are not good.

And then directly after that I went to Wal-Mart to take back the vinyl I had ordered for her online as a Christmas gift. I had it in my car, waiting to be unwrapped when we met up this morning. But I had it in my head that if she didn't have anything for me, then I would return it to Wal-Mart and get my money back. "

I know from when we were dating that my ex doesn't really like that guy, so I figured that she would want to know that bad things are being spread about her to a bunch of people. So, I texted her a few minutes after I found out and let her know everything I was told. She texts me back today saying that I misheard, and that I should stop slandering her to my friends. Basically she called me an asshole for the whole situation, when all I did was relay information to her that I figured a person would want to know about themselves.

Tl;dr - Told my ex about a malicious rumour about her, got called an asshole for doing so.

Did I fuck up somehow? I thought that I was doing the respectable thing."
3xf3ah,,"Firstly, I NEVER refer to my son as my stepson. He and his mother are the loves of my life and I am a better man for having them in my life. I have raised him, let’s call him “Mario”, with my wife for the last seven years, he’s ten now. His biological dad, let’s call him “Frank”, has no interest in him and only has visitation because HIS mother wanted to see her grandson so she hired a lawyer for “Frank” and now “Frank” sees “Mario” every other weekend. Nearly every visit ends much sooner than the 48 hours it is supposed to, mainly because “Frank” ""has plans"". He was verbally and emotionally abusive to my wife when the two of them were a couple so now I do all the communicating with “Frank” so he can’t hurt my wife. Well now “Frank” is married and his wife wants kids but “Frank” does not and has made it clear he doesn’t want to be around the one child he has fathered. After all these years he acts as a buddy, not a parent, to “Mario”.


So this last Sunday when we go pick up “Mario” and after he tells us about his time with his bio-dad I mention that Star Wars is opening this week and ask would he be interested in seeing it. He says, “’Frank’ said I can’t see it with you because I have to see it with him. I really don’t want to see it anymore.” After a little bit my son just busts out that he was excited to see it but after he was told that he couldn’t see it with his mother and I and that he’ll be in trouble with his bio-dad if he does he just lost all interest. The sadness in his voice was crushing.


Skip to today. It’d been bothering me and I couldn’t contain it. I text his bio-dad and step-mom and ask if what my son said was true about ""Mario"" not being allowed to see the movie with his mother and I. I get a series of messages back about how I am an asshole for taking him to the movie “after they have had tickets for months and have been planning this ‘Father/Son’ bonding event”. I NEVER said I was taking him. I very straightfowardly asked if ""Mario"" was threat"

I've had a lot of stress lately personally, and I really didn't expect (should I have?) to help her out today. I do feel like an asshole for not planning it, but no specific demands were made. Not only that but were they made this morning in a clear manner, I would be more than welcome to. So here's the skinny on the ""fight"" that happened.

So her COPD wakes me up at 7 am which is fine, I was happy to sleep in. I get up, get some caffeine, and join her on the patio where she drinks her first glass of wine and her first cig. Now get this, I'm a self-centered busy little fuck or whatever, I had no idea at that hour in the morning what day it was or what her plans were. I completely forgot. My head was full of thoughts about work and other stresses, my weird ass dreams last night, and who was going to walk the dogs today. 

So she first asks what my plans are. Thinking this is just small talk I say, something work related...and maybe something else. 

She then says ""we need boxes."" To which I reply completely non-defensively (I thought) ""well I don't need any, thanks."" 

To which she gets mad. She says ""well, we are moving together you know."" 

And I say ""of course but who ""we"" I really don't like ""we"", if you want help from me can you please ask me to help exactly how you want.""

Now I'm self-diagnosed aspergers. I have a lot of the traits. I always tell people I miss cues and expectations a lot, its not from a lack of empathy. At this point in the conversation, again, I had no idea what d"
3xje1p,,"I come from a family where everyone would write down lists of what they wanted for Christmas. My fondest Christmas memories have been getting things on the top of my list, even if they weren't at all expensive. On the other hand, gifts from aunts and uncles tended to be more expensive but less heartwarming, like a controller that I haven't used once in years, and duplicates of things I already have like MP3 players. I felt grateful that they spent so much money, but sad that I couldn't really enjoy it as much as they wanted to.


I'm completely opposed to the idea that you're supposed to telepathically know what your SO wants for Christmas (or anyone, for that matter). It's especially hard since my girlfriend and I don't share very many hobbies: she's not a gamer, she already has all the music and movies that she wants (and her tastes are different than mine), she doesn't read for pleasure often, and she's already seen Star Wars. She's under the impression that it's supposed to be a surprise, and it's fine if I don't want it to be for me, but she wants it to be for her. I told her that I really, honestly didn't know what to get her, and jokingly said ""I might end up getting something you don't want, like a vacuum or a sexy maid outfit"". (She's totally into that kind of humor, she plays Cards Against Humanity and is fine with Holocaust jokes) She got sort of passive-aggressive mad, like she's not visibly upset but she was slightly colder to me for the rest of the day.

In the end I'm probably going to get her chocolate or a fancy date or something safe like that. I wouldn't actually follow through with it, and it was an obvious joke. But I haven't apologized, and I don't think I'm in the wrong for not wanting to gamble my money on something she may end up disliking. AITA?"
3xkax4,,"TL;DR my partner is upset with me because I won't watch the newest star wars movie with him. I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a ""couple of hours every two years"". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?

First: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.

My partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.

Here's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He "
3xm15c,,"First off, I'm an introverted person and I don't have that many close friends. I have a few close friends from highschool and my roommates. I'm currently a college student so I don't have a ton of money. I'm okay with giving gifts to some of my closest friends, but it seems like everyone is coming out of nowhere to give me gifts, which in my eyes has the obvious implication that I need to get them one.

My family isn't huge on christmas. The kids get to ask for something they couldn't usually afford but nothing crazy. But my family has money. I don't know if people give me gifts because this is common? What do you do if you're not a person who likes giving people gifts? I would rather not get gifts or give gifts with a few close exceptions."

My dad cooks all kinds of things and has lots of projects like making beef jerky, smoked foods, and just experimenting with recipes.

I open the fridge to find a ziplock of what look like fried chicken chips (not sure how else to explain it). They looked tasty honestly. I ask what they are and my dad said ""oh bring those over here, they're amazing""

I bring them over, ask what it is, and my dad said ""it's chicken! It's delicious, eat some!""

So I take a bite, and my dad asks ""how is it?"" And I say ""really good"" though it was like eating just chicken skin, i didn't want to insult my dad's cooking so I put the rest of the piece I had in my mouth.

My dad and brother start cracking up and I can already guess it. ""This was for Buckley (the dog), wasn't it..."" And they're still dying of laughter and nod that it was indeed dog food.

I wasn't crushed or anything, but I have a pretty sensitive gag reflex. But rather than walk to the garbage and gag it out of me, I beat myself to the gag and just lean over my dad sitting near
Me, opened my mouth, and let it all just fall out and onto his shirt.

My dad flipped a fucking shit at me. Just starts with this whole attitude of how disgusting it is that I would just spit out my food on someone and how unfunny that was and just disgusted with me and completely killed the fun mood they were having at my expense. 

I have been home for less than 3 hours and I already can't wait for
the week to end so I can go back to where I live now.

I honestly don't care if I'm an asshole or not. I don't regret what I did. But I am a bit curious what other people think. To my dad and my brother I'm the asshole. I'm interested in what your point of view is (and take what I"
3xqmpw,,"I just found a friend has died, he took his own life a few days ago. We were friends 10-15 years ago and have had the odd Facebook conversation here and there. 

A mutual friend (also from elementary school) also messaged me and let me know about his passing and I'm now being told when and where the funeral is. I really don't want to go - it'll feel fake, I know no one there and really his death has not affected me in any way. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to go?"
3xt7ks,,"So first things first, I am 21, working full time in a bank and have been since I was 18. Due to this I am moved out, have a fair bit of savings (Not a massive amount) and a car (Agian nothing great only about 8k but I payed for it)

None of my old high school friends worked straight of school, most of them did nothing for a few years and have only recently started working, a few months back one of my friends asked to borrow 6k in order to buy a car (He currently had one financed, but he had 20k owning on a 16k car) he told me he intended to use the 6k I would borrow him to buy a new car, then he would sell his current car, pay me back and then put the rest off of the finance, and he would be in a much better financial situation then he was, all within the space of roughly 30 days.
I was very hesitant about it but I lent him the money and let it go for about a week.

As I ask him how selling the car is going he tells me, his sister is going to pay for the car, but due to her only being 18, she cannot afford to just outright pay the 15k he would have wanted, so instead she would make the payments on the car instead, but it would stay in his name. After a bit of a discussion over how dumb that was, he told me that he would not be able to pay me my 6k back, but he would instead send me $200 every fortnight until it was repayed, so rather then me getting my money back within 30 days, I am facing the realization of not being fully repayed for 30 fortnights (13 months).

So REDDIT, would I be the arse hole for asking him for my 6k by the end of January, with some sort of ultimatum, or should I just let it slide, knowing that maybe he can not afford the 6k and can not get the money off of anyone else.

P.S
I have lent him 2k in the past to buy a new computer, which he payed me for within two months.

My savings was growing rather high, and I had began talking to people about either investing in stock or getting into the property game, and thought the month wait would"
3xwcoy,,"A car had been trying to pass me in the right hand land for a minute leading up to all this, but I did not change lanes because most of the right lanes were truck traffic or slower-moving vehicles. I tend to drive in the left hand lane at a speed that keeps me two-car lengths from the car ahead of me.

I was approaching a sharp 25MPH ramp going 63mph in a 50mph zone in NYC. I didn't think 70mph was appropriate while approaching a blind 25mph turn and a complete stop. So I stayed in the left-hand lane, continuing to block a car that had been tailing me. After this turn, cars come to a complete stop at a toll gate, so I started braking going to the turn. The car that had been tailing me dodged in between a slower-moving vehicle and tried to cut me off, but failed to, again. I think this was dangerous, so I flashed my lights at them once they passed me after the turn and approaching the toll. I flashed them about 5 times.

After the toll gate, I flashed them again, as a final fuck you. This is when the other car started to brake-check me (which is funny, because I wasn't in a rush anyway) and then tailgated me for a mile. When I left my lane, they followed, and they switched between tailgating me and brake-checking me. I flashed my lights at him during most of this, quite a lot.

AITA here? Or is this just low-level road rage turned real road rage?

I had told her months beforehand that I didn't want to do anything and would rather have a quiet night in."
3y53v9,,"Okay so I started texting this girl I used to know.

I tell her I like her

She tells me she lives really really far away.

I say AND I QUOTE ""I'm fine with just being friends you know?"" 

I tell her this again when she calls me. 

She continues to talk to me about whatever for a day or so.

Finally she says ""Where do you see this going""

and I say ""uh no where because we live really far away and this can't work""

She tells me to fuck off and that I'm a horrible person.


Now I feel terrible if she genuinely thought we had something but it's like WHAT DID YOU EXPECT WE LIVE SO FAR AWAY!? I probably shouldn't have flirted with her but I didn't really think I was you know?

I feel horrible but I want the honest truth did I fuck up?


Edit: Seems people are actually a bit torn on this one but I'm gonna side with the asshole-sayers. Conversation ended with a ""You're a piece of shit"" and I responded with ""Merry Christmas"". I guess that's that then. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night."
3y83i0,,"My mom is notoriously hard to shop for, so my dad said he'd figure out something to get her for Christmas on his own this year, and discouraged my sister and I from buying anything, since she would most likely end up criticizing it. Later on, she told us herself not to get her anything for whatever reason, as mothers are wont to do. For the first time in my life, I didn't end up getting my mom anything. Christmas day comes, and she unwraps a smartwatch from my dad (which is really quite a bit outside the family's budget this year). And nothing else. It's been a few hours since then. Other than quietly telling my sister and I that she doesn't like the watch (no surprise, knowing her), she's been avoiding contact with the family. I don't think she ever thanked my dad, and she might have been crying a little bit. I'm not old enough to drive or get a job in my state, so buying something would have been difficult, and my dad isn't wrong - she usually ends up criticizing every gift she gets on any occasion. I wasn't too keen on getting passive-aggressive comments for whatever I got her. That said, I did find myself in a department store with some cash once these past few weeks, so I had an opportunity to get something, even if she wouldn't like it. Am I the asshole for listening to my folks in spite of social convention?

EDIT: I have been trying to ask her what's wrong periodically. She's silent, except to say something like ""nothing, thanks,"" which is unusual, as she's normally pretty open.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the input, folks. My mother is generally a really polite, caring woman, but I don't think she understands gift protocol in the least. It's also come to light that an unrelated personal matter has been upsetting her, which might explain some of her behavior. I think I'll give her a gift card next time around. It's impersonal, but that way she can get herself something she actually wants. (God knows what that might be.) And I'll be working by then, maybe driving, so"
3ybxdg,,"Okay, the title definatly sounds like i'm an asshole and I really think I am in this one but here's the back story first. So, whenever I go to my grandpas, the neighbors come over too. They've got two 13 year old kids who constantly annoy everyone not just talking a lot of crap about everyone but taking food, phones. So, everyone in my extended family will talk bad about them even if they go into the house for 3 seconds someone will say something bad. 

Anyways, yestreday they kept taking my phone and just being completely obnoxious even to my little cousin who is 5 but doesn't know better. I finally snapped and started saying how their family is horrible, they're parents are alcoholics etc etc. So i'm packing up to leave to head home by myself and my mom comes up(drunk) and starts trying to say ""talk to me, are you on drugs"" and I constantly told her i'll talk to her later and to let me go so I can be left alone but she kept grabbing me and trying to take my keys so I pushed her and she fell down. I really felt bad I didn't mean to but I just wanted to leave and nobody would let me. Then my uncle tries to ""kick my ass"" because ""don't hit a girl, you pushed your mother"". My grandpa had to hold him back.

I know what I did was wrong in pushing my mom but she wouldn't let me go, literally tugging on my shirt so i can ""talk to her"" but even later she continued to annoy me because she kept asking why I was mad and I told her yet she insisted there was more too it and continued to not leave me alone. Anyways, I feel like the asshole because I pushed my mom, i'm not sure if I feel bad for calling out those kids because yes they're 12 &amp; 13 but I've never met a 12 or 13 year old that behaves that way and I felt like even when my family was like ""oh they're just 12"" In my mind my extended family &amp; my mom talk so much crap about and say stuff like ""oh I'd smack them if their parents weren't around"" but NEVER have done anything and I just got sick of it and knew that e"
3ycpqk,,"A friend, lets call him Todd, and I got in a heated argument earlier today over, first, whether a mutual friend was racist or not, and then afterwards whether it's okay to make jokes about the word nigger.

Todds argument:
-Our friend is racist because he has sided with white people on 4 controversial topics, IE Michael Brown shooting.
-It is never okay to make jokes involving 'nigger' due to its historical connotation.

My argument:
-Todd may not remember times in which he supported black people on an issue because it never would have made us upset enough to remember it, or confirmation bias. Additionally, I think it's a long call to make about someone on such an accusation, and that our friend may just be trying to be edgy and pick the unpopular side.
-I think that bringing light to the issue of racism through jokes is a good way to acknowledge racism, and that joking about 'nigger' in particular takes the hate out of the word and makes it have less ""stink.""

I feel as though he wasn't paying attention to my arguments, although it's very possible I was doing the same with him. Maybe this is more of a CMV kind of post. Am I the asshole for justifying jokes using 'nigger?'

With this information, we took our seats. 

Far too often my mom asked me, ""Is *that* his son?""

""No, mom. Please be quiet."" She wasn't asking in the quietest voice, and it is a smaller viewing room, so people are close together. I don't know what else she might say, and you never know who might be listening. Spoiling Star Wars is a worse crime than murder to some.

The scene where Rey and Kylo Ren meet for the first time, my mom asks, ""Are they brother and sister?""

""No, mom. Shh.""

""Tell me!""

At this point, I just put my finger over my lips and watch the movie. 

Now **that** scene comes on, and they walk on the catwalk my mom says,""Is this where he dies?"" in a voice loud enough to be heard by those around.

She's quiet the rest of the movie. Come to when we are in the car, ""Sorry, GreatMemes, I forgot I was seeing a movie with *you*.""

3yk7px,,"My friend is currently in love with her boss. They spend a lot of time with each other, both work long hours, both attractive people. I get that. She is infatuated with him, and has said many times that she loves him. He has also told her that he feels the same way about her. 

Here is the problem. He is married, with children. She has told me that they've discussed this and nothing is going to come of it. I believed that she would be smart enough to show restraint. At least this was I was led to believe. I was hanging out with her roommate watching the football game last night, not knowing that she was back in town. She was, she was hanging out and cleaning up, which I found out was because her boss was coming over.  That's fine there's a bunch of us hanging out at the apartment. They sat away from us at the table, I would glance over and they would be sitting extremely close to each other. At one point I saw that they were holding hands under the table.  Am I the asshole for wanting to cut her out of my life for having this relationship with a married man? 

I keep thinking that what if this man was my brother in law and he was emotionally cheating on my sister. I don't know if I can continue being friends with a person who thinks this type of behavior is okay. Am I the asshole for wanting to end this friendship?"
3ykcup,,"So my friend asked me to get her a list of stuff while I was away on holidays - just basic stuff like candy, makeup etc. The list was about 10 items long. I had forgotten about it until she indirectly reminded me on my 2nd last day - I had helped her with something else prior and had forgotten about this list, so a bit of a fck up there. 


On my last day I spent 3 or 4 hours going from store to store trying to find the stuff she wanted. I got everything on the list bar a few things that I just couldn't get because they didn't sell them anywhere in the city. One of the things I got wrong (wrong colour), and another they didn't have and I got something I thought was close enough. 


I thought she'd be pretty happy with the stuff I did get and the effort I put in, but rather than being appreciative she was pissed off I didn't get everything and got a couple of things wrong. 


I have a big problem with her being so unappreciative and trying to make me out to be the asshole for not getting all of her stuff. I have explained why I couldn't get the things I couldn't get etc., but she still maintains she has a right to be annoyed with me. Am I the asshole? "

3yop4u,,"My first general admission concert was when I was 11 or 12 and ever since then I've tried my best to pick up on the etiquette around me to ensure that I'm not being a douche. I've always seen people navigate closer to the stage if there is a pocket of space available further up. I know navigating closer during an act can be rude but I was under assumption that during the down time whenever the audience is shuffling about to use the restroom/grab drinks is perfectly fine.

Anyways, last night I politely moved my way a bit closer up since there was a good amount of empty space. I had 3 people get mad at me. It turned out they had planned to show up early to call dibs on a relatively large bit of empty space (about 16 ft^2 of leg room) near the *already densely packed* front section. The angered attendees were a fratboy and two college-aged girls, they seemed unfamiliar with concerts that didn't have assigned seating so I just kind of shrugged off the confrontation and stayed put, where they harassed me for the rest of the night.

While moving forward, I didn't put my hands on anyone or try to bump anyone over. I gave plenty of 'sorry/excuse me's, smiled, and was completely under the assumption that this was acceptable behavior in-between sets. With how angry their reaction was though, I can't help but doubt myself. Am I the asshole? I deal with anxiety and it has been replaying over and over in my head to the point where I just can't concentrate on anything else.



**tl;dr**: Politely moved into an empty pocket I found in a dense section during a concert after assuming it was acceptable behavior. People unfamiliar with general admission became angered that I entered a fairly large spot they wanted to reserve for extra room. Was harassed all night, now I wonder if I deserved it."
3yosps,,"I'm using a throwaway for various reasons. So, with a little bit of backstory, I'm from the UK, am 17, am an only child and currently live with my parents. My parents tend to go out a lot of the time and sometimes leave me alone frequently. They leave me things to cook for myself if they're not going to be there the whole day/night. However, most of the time I have to cook myself something (usually rice and fish fingers or something like that) and resort to snacking alot as a result of not having much food in the house.

So today I've been at home with my Dad doing some school work and playing some games while my Mum's been out the whole day with one of her friends. This evening my dad's gone out to the pub and to a restaurant with his friends while my mum has gone out with her friends too. They also went out last night to a friends house and I had to make something for myself as usual. I was a little mad at them and told my Dad that I wanted a fully cooked meal but he told me to just have leftover food from Christmas. I asked him if we could go to Mcdonalds or something because it would have at least filled me up. He told me he would only go to get one if I paid for it.

So reddit, am I the asshole for getting mad at my parents that they won't pay for me to have takeaway food or at least make me something themselves? I'm not really sure if I'm overreacting at all or they're genuinely in the wrong. "
3yppzw,,"OK so my roommate Billy and I moved into an apartment last April. When we moved in, the agreement was that we would split the cost of furnishing the apartment, as we only had furniture for our rooms, and the living room was empty, with bare walls throughout the house. We wouldn't necessarily split the costs of the items, but we'd each buy things that build a good living space together.

The idea here was that we both now have a good paying jobs, and don't need to live in dingy places anymore, so we would get some nice stuff.

When we moved in one of the rooms was bigger so I agreed to pay an extra $40/mo. for it. Making rent $360 &amp;amp; $320, respectively. 

We also have a 3rd roommate, Jack who lives in a tiny room for $220.

So a few months go by, and I had been asking Billy to throw in with me on a TV or to come with me to get furniture or to maybe get some things to put on the walls, but Billy always said he had no money to spare, so I waited for a few more months.

After about eight months go by, I got tired of waiting and just went and bought all the furniture for the house - including a 55 inch flat screen, a tv stand, end tables, coffee table, 6 or 7 nice, large wall decorations, Apple TV, and other miscellaneous things for the apartment. (To be fair, Billy bought a 1st gen Wii and a blu ray player.)

Billy now loves hanging out in the living room, does it all the time, and everyone who comes over compliments on it. 

But here comes the tricky part: we're moving next year.

In our new place there will inevitably be a master bedroom. 

My logic is that, considering that I have furnished our entire apartment by myself, (and some extra because we are moving to a house next year) - I should get the master bedroom and the rent should be divided equally.

Roommate says that it's bullshit, but I think it's only fair because I'll be furnishing the whole place!

(Our 3rd roommate Jack agrees, and is going to split rent equally.)

Am I the asshole?

I brought up the fact that she is an authoritarian bitch that tries to control everything (tries to control every little thing, uses shock collar on her dog cause she is a shitty trainer) and then she try and turn it around saying of all the things she does for them (buying presents and etc). Which my response was buying kids things does not give you the right to call them stupid. Am I the asshole?"
3yskvd,,"I live in a city that's famous for tourism.  About a year ago, my cousin, her husband, and their young son visited for the first time.  They asked me for suggestions, and I gave them a list.  When they arrived, they didn't want to go to any of those places.  I ended up driving them to where they told me to go.

What annoyed me is through later conversation, it was revealed they hadn't even researched my suggestions before rejecting them.  They didn't know what the places were.  It's not like they had very particular tastes either.  They often complain they can't do anything with a kid, ignoring the kid-friendly activities I've suggested, and spend most of their time wandering around shopping districts, while the poor kid is clearly bored out of his skull.  And they won't even take my suggestions on shopping areas.

I had hoped it would be different this year, but it was exactly the same.  I go to pick them up (in a really heavy traffic tourist district), and drive them where they want to go.  They haven't even asked to see my apartment, which admittedly suits me since it's not really set up for guests.  

I don't even really know why this bothers me so much, but it does.  Don't get me wrong.  They're nice people, they include me in activities, and always pay for meals.  But I feel like as a local to the city they're visiting, they should give my advice at least a little weight.  I've tried to hint at this, but would I be an asshole if I raised this complaint with them clearly?"

Also, I sometimes have trouble understanding plot points or social contexts of what people are saying in movies. So when I have a question, I usually wait for a lull in the scene and I ask it as quietly as I can, usually to my boyfriend next to me.  Nobody's ever shushed me or anything but I can't be too sure. I just want to make sure I'm not actually ruining the movie for others."

People always say to me ""Oh, he's your brother, you're gonna appreciate him in the future."" But it's not like that, when he was younger my dad was over seas, and after that my parents got divorced. We've mostly been with our mom ever since, we go to our dads about 1 day a week. And he's learned my mom's flaws in parents (ex: doing something to her if she won't get him something.) And when he's with my mom he's always mean to her. But when he's with my dad he's always well behaved. Enough with the relationships with my parents, let's talk about our relationships. I've always tried to be nice to him, like giving advice for school or playing a game with him. But he's always mean to me, I always have to live in fear that he will break all my things, yet I won't break any of his things. Even when he gets in fights with my mom he always takes one of my things, or maybe break it. I don't want to hurt him, but somethings I have too (The only times I've hurt him if he's hurting my mom.) He's always disrespectful to people my mom is dating, or friends with. Sometimes he's even the reason the person dumped her. I could go on for awhile about what he's done to me and other people, but I can't think of a time that he's been nice to me.

Well I just wanted to figure out if I'm the asshole for not wanting him, in some cases wanting him dead."
3yxf2q,,"Happy new year, reddit.


My new year has not been very happy.. 
To start off, I am 18 years old and live in Australia. Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does ""graffiti"". By this, I mean he writes the word ,""Anarchy"" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. 


Anyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. 


Hours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. 


Me and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).

I walk back inside the house to ge"
2hyfpw,,"I'm using a throw away.

So, I am still in High School, but growing up my life hasn't been very fun. My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)

After that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has ""mental problems"" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.

So that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.

After those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.

Having to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, b"

I asked him for a back massage, not a deep tissue, or long massage, one to help ease my back up because I was in incredible pain. I am about 6 weeks pregnant and in the very early stages for me my back just locks up. 

He said that he can't because he was too sick, but on Thursday he wasn't sick enough to go play badminton with his friends, and on Saturday he went out drinking with some people for a ""high school"" reunion. But I asked him for a ten minute back massage and he says he is too sick. 

I broke down crying and yelling at him for being an inconsiderate jerk, he counters with ""I give you back massages and foot massages all the time"" (and he does), and that he was really sick on that day (Friday) but I still think he is the asshole for claiming sickness to get out of it, but still being ""ok"" to go drinking and playing sports.

Mom gave it to my fiance when he said he was going to propose. I took it for an insurance valuation and they told me that the setting for the diamonds are in poor condition and I could lose the stones at any moment. It's so bad they can't perform a temporary repair; it looks like I'm going to have to have the ring reset or even remade which is quite expensive

2imkcf,,"**TLDR: I didn't pass a class I needed to continue in my program. I wanted to make it up during the fall semester instead of over the summer. My adviser said I couldn't so I went straight to the professor and was told I was disrespectful for going over her head. AITA?**

For my major I needed a B- minimum in a lower level history class. I got a C+. I was told I had to take another lower level history class over the summer on campus to continue in the program. Most students live within an hour of campus. I live out of state and couldn't afford to stay on campus.

I talked to my adviser and got approved to take a similar, very expensive, class online through another university. Older students in my position mentioned that they didn't have to make up the lower level class over the summer and they took an additional upper level history class during the school year. My adviser said that was not an option. I was not satisfied. 

I went to the very old and influential history professor for our department and asked him what he'd be most comfortable with. He sided with me because of a number of factors including:

* my distance from home

* students doing the same thing in the past
* my good GPA
* not trusting an outside institution
* overlapping content with my minor. 

He claimed to be the one I really needed permission from. When I told my adviser I was informed I was being disrespectful for trying to work around the system and going over her head after getting a no. I ended up taking the online class.

The way I see it I was trying to be assertive, explore all my options, advocate for myself, and avoid financial costs. The way she sees it I'm an entitled brat who thinks the rules don't apply to me, they were generous enough by letting me stay home, and I should have just made the grade to begin with. What do you think? Was I the asshole?

So, senior year. I have to have a gov class to graduate and between taking IB classes, I have not found the time to get the class in. So me and my friend got in the same class and we sit in the back together.   

I'll admit. I love politics with a burning passion, but in my family I never get a chance to talk about them because my hyper conservative father will scream over me and my mother just sides with who ever is currently bitching about whatever. I'm in a friend group of mostly guys who are incredibly liberal and they all end up screaming over me, so in gov class (despite the demographic that is the rest of the classs) I can finally speak my opinion. This pisses off my female friend.  

Of course, I didn't know this at first. I'm a tad oblivious to social cues that would tell me I was upsetting her. Turns out she has been complaining about me to my other friends for the past month about how when she was around me she ""couldn't have an opinion"" etc etc, despite the fact I let her talk about what she believes before stating my opinion. I do realize now I've sort have been steam rolling her, and for this part, I am the jerk.  

But then here's the part I'm wondering about this. It's this sort of behavior that upsets me so much. This passiveness. So I'm upset. Plus she is incredibly two faced and a liar.

We had a great day, and I was in a really good mood.  The subway was packed on our way back, but I didn't let it dampen my mood.  I stood holding the bar and I guess I had made eye contact with various people (mistake #1, I suppose).  This young woman sitting with a magazine says ""why are you smiling at me?""

Me, leaning forward: I'm sorry?
Her: You shouldn't smile at people.  It's insulting.
Me: Oh...sorry.

The whole thing had me really perplexed, which turned into annoyance.  Part of me wishes I'd reacted a little faster (""if you think that's insulting, wait until you hear this one, lady..."").  Part of me also wondered if it was cultural, but she didn't have an accent at all (whatever that's worth).

So, am I the asshole here?  I completely understand if you call me a weirdo, but smiling at her wasn't really intentional.  Like I said, I was in a good mood. "
2jitla,,"Backstory, and I'm going to try my best to show both sides. My girlfriend has been very busy for the last few months with a play she's in and other projects, and making new friends and all. And over these three months, I've been getting more and more depressed, my medications aren't helping as much as they used to, and I just keep getting more insecure. Over the past two weeks or so she just seems to get mad at every joke I make, but when I respond to her being mad by being short(a bad way of doing it, I realize), she just insists that she said it was a joke. 

Last night, she was talking about how she complimented her friend Aaron's collarbones, and I jokingly said something along the lines of ""Psh, mine are better"" with an obviously sarcastic and joking tone. She told me not to insult him to make myself look better, and I tried to say it was just a joke, and then she said I had been short with her lately a lot, and it just became this big fight. It's the first time we've fought. 

It ended with me saying that I wasn't angry about the joke, I was just tired of being felt like anything I said was either dismissed, or told I was being rude, or things like that. She went to bed and I did too, and I couldn't stop thinking about why I reacted that way, and realized that over the last few months I hadn't felt wanted from her at all, if that makes sense. So I sent her a text explaining that, and saying that I brought up how I felt in the worst possible way in the argument last night, and that I wasn't trying to blame her, I was just trying to say how I felt and maybe she could understand why I felt that way better. 

I woke up today and checked my phone, and she just was mad and said that I shouldn't be pissy because she was busy with theater and things, even though I specifically pointed out in my text that it wasn't about her being busy with that, and that I loved that she was happy with those things and supported her all the way.

Despite the many signs that say ""Keep dogs leashed"", as soon as we entered, another dog came running towards us, blocking our path and following us. Because they were interacting in a friendly manner, I allowed my dog to sniff her for a minute or so. When the owner (who was having a phone call during this) finally realized, she came running over to retrieve her dog. Upon realizing that the dog wasn't listening to her, I walked mine away. While departing, I heard her say on the phone ""Some idiot is just standing around with her dog, nearly caused a dog fight.""

If you allow your dog to wander unleashed, then that sends a clear signal to me that she is non-aggressive. If you don't like it, there's a pretty clear solution to that issue."

My brother lent a few books to my best friend.

  

 My best friend comes from a difficult background and has, in several years past, taken advantage of our trust on a couple situations. I confronted him about these things and he apologized for having done what he did and we (me and my brother) accepted that— and moved on. I've since never had a problem and we have a great relationship. But now 6+ years down the road, my brother lent his books to my friend. (the lending happened 2 months ago.) He now wants them back and says this will be a test for both him and me, (again, I was never involved with the lending) where I am to say: ""my brother wants his books back,"" and then whether or not he tries to pull a fast one and not return one or two will determine if he is ""done with him"" or not. He knows which need to be returned.

  I accepted at first but he would not tell me which books were lent so I could be sure I get them all back because I'm apparently a part of some problem and will evidently somehow assist my friend in the pulling off said fast one. I was not allowed to know whether or not my best friend would betray our trust because I would not only ""let it slide"", but also assist him.


  

I really just could not understand his reasoning for any of this. After a while I got fed up with his accusations and need extreme need to test people so I suggested he just tell my friend the books that need returning, and simply get all his books back. Everyone would be happy, and there would be no chance or need for anyone to be tricked or tested. No need to be so uncertain of anyone.

  It turned out that was too much for him, my arguing against him was ridiculous and unfounded and all these things I told him were flawed. He went on and on... but my brother just starts saying things that are beyond me sometimes. We've never seen eye to eye on most subjects.

On the first day we went out to the lake and came back, I dropped my swim trunks, ray bans, and hat off in my room (on the floor, right next to my bed), and went back upstairs to hang out. It should be noted that my room had access to the back yard, but that it was in no way a heavy traffic zone, and yeah, putting them on the ground probably wasn't the best choice.

The ray bans were given to me as a high school graduation gift in 2011 from my grandma. I know they're just sunglasses, but I digress.

Anyway, someone spots a bear in the woods, we're all getting drunk and don't really pay much attention to it, but apparently the little brothers went outside to go talk to the sheriff or something. Cue later that night, I go downstairs to my room completely hammered to find my sunglasses in three separate pieces, mangled, about 3 feet away from where I'd left them. 

The next morning I casually ask the boys if they went downstairs, the classic troublemaker stays completely silent (the 14 year old) and the 12 year old says they did. I then made it clear that I was upset, without getting angry, and asked who stepped on my glasses. It became clear that the 14 year old had. I told him that it wouldn't have been that big of a deal if he had come forward about it, but instead I had to pry it out of him, and in the end, he didn't so much as begin to apologize. Just sat there in silence.

So I ask of you, /r/AmITheAsshole, am I the asshole for asking that he help me pay for a new pair?

At the end of the day though, I felt as if he didn't ""get me"" like my other partners had, but as it was his first real relationship I decided not to give up on this great guy.

Upon graduation, I was offered a job 900 miles away. Rex had his company back home and couldn't leave. I wanted to break it off right then and save myself the pain, but he and his sweet words convinced me we could make it work. Neither of us believes in soulmates so we thought if we put in the work we could make it happen. I moved, he stayed, and our long-distance relationship began.

And by LDR, I mean my chronic loneliness. I am not an outgoing person, I didn't know a single person in the whole state, I walked into my empty apartment crying almost every day, and I clung to Rex for comfort. We alternate turns to take a flight and got to see each other maybe every other month. He truly tried to be there for me, but those happy weekends when he came down would only make me sadder when he left again. He said what he could but I knew my depression was wearing on him and us. At one point he told me just to stop talking about sad things. I knew I had to turn things around, and luckily I was at a company full of young transplants like me, so I began forcing myself to go out on weekends. I flourished. I made friends, got to know the new city, and was finally smiling again. The problem with this new life was that Rex wasn't a part of it. He didn't know the people I talked about and couldn't relate to the culture I was now a part of. I live in an awesome place, and"
2b1kyp,,"I will try to provide as much context as possible to present the story in an unbiased way.

I come from a very conservative Christian family that raised me up through private school with the sole intention of me going to a 4 year college. I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. 

I was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying ""I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet."" I said ""I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,"" to which he replied ""Don't be a smart ass.""

A little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marke"
2b1ql0,,"I asked my father yesterday if he could drop me off at a friend's house today. He said ""don't count on it"", and so he meant probably not, but there's a possibility I suppose. I ask him again about it this morning, and he said he couldn't because my mother is going out and is taking the car, and our other car needs to be fixed. I asked my mom about it, and she said that she could just have my dad drop her off, because she's going to a mall to shop with one of her friends, and they're only taking one car anyways so my mom's car would just be sitting at her friend's house all day if she drove there. I told my dad this, and he came up with other reasons why I couldn't go (too busy, have to do this, that, etc). I then asked him why he even told me I couldn't go because my mom was taking the car, and he blew up on me. He said ""This is why I won't let you get your license"" because I argue too much. My mom thought he was also being irrational, but am I wrong?"
2b2co4,,"Back-story: I worked with the male part of this particular couple at a retail store. We had a pretty good friendship, but ultimately, I ended up going above and beyond quite often. I have gotten up after 2 am on a couple of occasions to rescue them because they can't drive (they still do illegally on occasion, hence why I would have to rescue them...one got caught and I have to take the other to jail to bail them out and drive them home). I even let them live with me for a period of time because they got suddenly kicked out of their place. I don't think I have been in a spot where I needed them in any type of emergency situation, but I don't think I hold that against them.

Fast-forward to modern times:

My fiance and I hang with them about once or twice every two months. Not very often. I asked if they would be interested in taking photos for our wedding, to which they gladly agreed. We hadn't talked pricing or anything yet, though I expected it soon. Two months go by and not a word from them. I reach out and we hang again, I bring up the wedding photos again with them. This time they have a ""guesstimate"" number. They say $1000 is normal, but they would only charge me $500.

My friend photographer has yet to graduate from film school and has never shot a wedding before in his life. My fiance and I discuss the offer and decide to try to work it down to $400 instead of $500. We try to set up a time to meet at the venue to discuss photo opportunities. Anytime we are busy, seems to be the times they are wanting to meet up. As if trying to postpone going to the venue. I had to practically beg them to even go in the first place. The female didn't think they should have to go at all.

We are now under a month from our wedding and still no set in stone photographer for our wedding. We decided to check thumbtack. We found a photographer for $400, she set up a time to meet at the venue, sent a contract, and a questionnaire within a few hours of us responding. My friends had "
2b7py5,,"So the SO had recently moved into a new apt. She is trying to make this our home and get me to spend more time there. I am with it. I have been investing time and money into it. And also started bringing some of my things there.

So she has to go away for work for 2 weeks. The plan was that I would spend most of the time there. Still staying at my home for 2 or 3 nights to get to work faster.

So. I get this phone call. Her estranged sister has just been assaulted by her bf. I need to go downstairs and give her mother the keys to the house so her and her son can stay over. I am pissed.

Firstly, this woman has all but avoided her family and kept this kid away for years. Now this person who has been described as irresponsible is now going to be staying in this apt. Unsupervised. With a toddler. For what is supposed to be 3 days (I know it will be longer).

Now AITA because I'm upset that she made this decision without my consultation? Without my input? This dwelling that's supposed to be ours except when it's convenient for it not to be is now once again her house. It wasn't an emergency anymore. This even happened the night before. More than enough time to call me and ask for my input.

It's not that I am put out. I'm just annoyed that she went to save this person who has been less than sisterly to her and has been known to screw up crap alone in ""our"" apt.

Oh and I forgot to mention I was asked by her mother to ""examine"" the sister to see if her nose is broken. Right. On my off time I am now giving medical advice like a doctor that has medical equipment and a degree. (I am a paramedic)

Honest input please?"

2bnroh,,"Throwaway account because some family members know my main account name on here.  The details in the post should be enough to identify me if they stumble upon this post, but my sister has, in the past, looked up my post history and used it against me.  Anyway,

**Back story**

In 2009, my fiancee and I were renting an apartment when my grandmother went into a rehabilitation facility after a fall.  My family was pretty sure she wouldn't be coming back home, and they asked my fiancee and I to move in.  They told us at this time that we would be renting from them under the terms that:

- They would charge us a rental fee equal to the mortgage amount, no more and no less (so we were basically paying the mortgage but the house wasn't in our name and we can't claim it on our taxes)

- When we were ready to buy, they would sell the house to us at [Market Value - 10% - {however much money we had paid in rent so far}]

- If something ever happened to them, they would leave the house to us in their will.

In 2011, we got married (yay!) and we were going to start saving up to buy the house.  They told us at this point that they realized they couldn't fulfill the terms of the ""MV-10%-paid"" plan they previously suggested, that they would lose too much money.  We would just have to pay market value. ($130k)  We asked the price, they told us, and we balked.  We said it was out of our price range ($80-100k) and we would be looking around.

We contacted a realtor, got preapproved, we were going through a first time homebuyer class that, if completed, would pay our down payment and closing costs (up to $5000) on the house.

Once my mom found out, she got really worried.  She said she wanted us to stay in this house.

A point relevant to the story that is important and complicates matters that I had neglected to mention to this point is that our house is next door to their house.  We share a yard (and we're not really outdoor people so their use of our yard is like 95% to 5% compared "
2brxdw,,"This one happened a couple of days ago. I was in the main shopping street in my town and about halfway down the pedestrianized section,  there's a seating area consisting of big stone blocks for seating. 

Now I am Muslim and I was, at the time, wearing an abaya (long dress), hijab and a faceveil (niqab, which isn't unusual around here). I don't make a habit to wear the face veil all the time but this day I had chosen to do so. 

  I was walking down towards this seating area and when I got there, I decided to take 5min and sit down. To my left there were a group of teenage boys, who I heard making the usual remarks (which I was totally expecting and so ignored). 
   
 After a couple of minutes my attention was drawn back to this group, as I heard two of them discussing whether they should rip my veil off my head, because 'it would be funny'. Then someone else in the group I could hear was asking his friends if they had a lighter, so he could set my headscarf and veil on fire. 

  At this point I really lost it. I marched over to where they were sitting and confronted them, telling them (or more accurately, shouting at them) that not only was I not deaf because I had the niqab on, and so had heard every word they'd said, and that if they tried anything I would personally ensure they would feel pain. 

 Now I feel I may have acted a little asshole-ish, and so I leave it to reddit to decide. "
2btapw,,"I need to move to a new city for school that my sister happens to live in. She and her fiance just bought a house there. They offered me a (small) room in their house for $500 a month (utilities/internet included). On top of that I will have to pay the city for parking and my own groceries. One catch is that I cannot stay on weekends because my sisters fiance has a child from a previous marriage who will be there and they only have the one extra room. I will commute to the city I currently live in and will be able to stay with someone rent free for that  time. It wasn't a huge deal to have to leave since my program is only Mon-Thursday anyways, so I will actually only be living their 4 days a week. 

I looked up 1 bedroom rentals in apt/houses in their neighbourhood and found that with utilities/internet included they run from around 650-750. Some of those even include parking at no extra cost. There is even a whole basement apartment for 900 with all that included as well. Keep in mind that in those cases there would be no requirement to leave. 

will I be the asshole if I suggest I pay less? 500 is still cheaper than what I've found but considering I can't stay. Is it wrong to expect a family discount or would you consider that I am already getting one? "
313wls,,"First, you should probably disregard if you don't play Clash of Clans.


So I'm a lvl 92 in CoC, and my friend, let's call him Bob, is a lvl 105. He is one of my closest friends, and we are in high school. He got bored of CoC, still plays occasionally, by doesn't really care. I asked if I could play his account, he said yes. However he told me that he already share his account with one of his track team friends, call him Joe, who is a year or  2 above us. So 3 people have access to the account. Bob didn't specify who had more power over the account. Joe also has his own lvl 56 account.

I don't know Joe in real life.


We are all in the same clan, and then there is a revolt in the clan because Joe and his buddies don't like the clan leadership. I like the leadership, and Bob couldn't care less. Joe and his buddies cuss out the leader, then leave to make their own clan. Then Joe takes Bob's account, cusses out the leader, and leaves to join their clan. Joe promotes Bob's account to co-leader in their new clan.


I come on to Bob's account. I am mad that Joe impersonated Bob when he cussed out the leader, because that is abusing Bob's account. So I get revenge by using Bob's account to kick everyone out of Joe's clan. Then I cuss the clan out and said the old leader is a good leader. Then I leave and join the original clan with Bob's account. Then Joe comes on Bob's account, cusses out again, and leaves midwar. So before doing anything else, I tell everyone I am withdrawing from Bob's account until we work things out.


So who is the asshole, me or Joe? My guess is that everybody sucks."

Some of my friends and I decided it would be a fun thing to do after graduation, so we are going to SE Asia this summer.  However, we found out that Z is also planning his own trip there alone at around the same time as it's somewhere he's always wanted to go.  I felt we should keep our trip quiet until we could frame it in a more positive light than ""oh we like you but not enough to go travelling together"".  We've kept up this charade of not knowing what we're doing after graduation.

AITA for not wanting to tell Z about our plans until his plans are set in stone?  It'd avoid any awkwardness if Z wanted to join us, and making it appear like a last minute plan would save face all round. My friends would rather just tell him and let him deal with it.

This boyfriend. He's a creep. He's a loser with 2 kids from 2 different women. No education. My friend and I are both educated and made good life decisions for the most part. Anyway, he insists on hugging and kissing my cheek every time he says hello or goodbye to me, and it has always made me uncomfortable (He is from Louisiana btw, it's not a cultural thing). He always made comments about how my friend was too big and that I'm just the right size and just his type. He's tried to FB me and text me to talk, and I mostly ignored him unless it had to do with my friend. He's just creepy as hell and I feel incredibly uncomfortable being around him.
Recently, he checked my okcupid profile and wrote me saying something like ""Hi emeraldwinter, what are you looking for on here."" I didn't respond, but he kept checking my profile. I felt like it was time for me to talk to my friend about her boyfriend, especially since he was actively on a dating site. 
We met for lunch, and she told me that they broke up, are still sleeping together, and that she won't date anymore but she knows that he's talking to other girls. This definitely made me feel better talking about things with her. What an asshole guy. I left out parts that I felt would be hurtful towards her, but basically made her aware of things.
I don't know what was said after our lunch, but he took me off his friends list on FB and my friend has been really cold to me. He still checks my dating profile. Let me be clear...I have never nor will I ever have any attraction to this guy. Am I the asshole here?

3215e9,,"Throwaway because this is work-related. Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be concise. 

I own and run a company together with three male partners. I'm the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn't realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: ""Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?"" And then proceeded to bark in that partner's face like an angry dog.

I caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn't immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn't realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.

Now, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it's in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven't spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can't let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.

OK, so here's the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it's starting to show in our daily interactions. I don't really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn't say frie"

328lyz,,"Am I the asshole for thinking that telemarketers do not deserve one instant of courtesy from me?  I answer the phone in a small office and I suffer through easily 20 calls a day by robo-dialing pollsters, telemarketers in call centers, and individual salesmen cold-calling to offer something that is completely unwanted but a company like mine might use.  

Personally, I think what telemarketers do is save money and enrich themselves at the expense of the general public.  Sure, each individual occurrence is too small to criminalize or prosecute, but a multitude of them can make it unreasonably expensive to pay a staff to answer your business line, or make it insane for useful officers of a business to be reachable directly by phone.  Whether or not there is a Do No Call list, it should be illegal in all forms.  

I have never bought the argument that you shouldn't be rude to them because the person on the phone just needs the money and it's really the boss who should suffer.  Yes, the boss should suffer, but when I think something is wrong, I don't take a job doing it.  I think it's wrong to kick puppies, and if someone offered me $15/hr to kick puppies, I wouldn't do it.  Therefore the instant I know I'm talking to a robo-dialed salesman or pollster, I hang up without a word.  If it's one of those individual dialers who try to fool me into thinking they know the eponymous company owner/CEO (because they read the company name somewhere), I usually get hung up on and called again several times before I can ask in a civil tone that they never call again and explain that the CEO never picks up a call from a party he doesn't know.  Once an individual has redialed enough to have ignored at least one civil request to remove me from the dialing list and later become recognizable to me by voice, I am openly hostile and aggressive to them.  I have eventually told several of them to go fuck themselves with a rusty spike or something similar.

For a club to be recognized by the university it has to meet several steps, one of them is to have a constitution. I wrote the constitution myself and it was adopted into the club. The Cool Kids Club did well in the beginning, but ultimately sputtered out and become unrecognized by the university. 

This year a group of people who still attended the university approached me wanting to restart the Cool Kids Club and asked if they could use my constitution (as well as the Facebook group I made for the club.) I agreed, they adopted it, and the Cool Kids Club was back on. Sweet!

This is to allow freshman that want to be involved with the executive board a chance to do so.

The first reply is from ""Kevin"" who argues in favor of Fall elections, citing the potential Freshman interest. I reply with the part of the club constitution that outlines when elections are to be held. A few people get upset with me commenting, stating things like ""he doesn't even go here"" and ""why are you even posting right now?""

There was a significant response from Anthony stating his reasons for wanting the elections now instead of in the Fall, but said he'd be willing to do what the general body wants to do. He also questioned why I was responding to the thread. 

My motives were simple... I just wanted them to follow the constitution. I don't go to the university anymore, but I do know the rules they agreed to follow. Am I the asshole for pointing it out? Some of them seem to think so."
32orh4,,"So I've been with him for two years now, and yesterday his niece passed. I took it hard, he seemed to show no remorse or sadness to his niece passing. I got mad and told him,"" if that was our child would you even care?""
And he tells me, ""I don't even want kids.""

So here's some backstory on this topic:
He's known 100% that I was kids in the future and he would tell me that we will have some. Whenever we'd go shopping I'd look at children's books and he'd say things like, ""we'll get those for our kids."" 
Basically him telling me stuff I want to hear. 
A couple of months ago, I had a conversation with him basically saying that if he didn't want kids in the future then we shouldn't pursue the relationship. He got mad at me for because I'm saying that, ""our relationship is a waste."" Then he'll tell me that we will.

Okay, so I completely understand that I'm a we're still too young to have kids (we're 21)

Back to the original story:
So I ask, ""if you don't want kids, then why do you keep telling me that we will."" 
And he goes, ""so you'll stay with me.""

Basically, am I the asshole for not wanting to stay in the relationship because I want kids. When I told him that I want to be with someone who wants children, he lashed out on me with a bunch of ""fuck yous"" ""I loved you."" ""You never loved me."" ""I hope your happy"" etc.
I mean, I know I'm too young to have kids, but I know what I want in the future. I think it's fucked up on his part to keep leading me on making me believe that I'll eventually have kids.

32s0wt,,"**TL;DR my boyfriends good friend/flatmate is very passive aggressive and goes out of her way to control us (which she has some right to as it's her house). Am I a bad girlfriend for no longer making an effort to be friends when my boyfriend really wants everyone to get along? I used to be friendly but now I'm just civil and nothing more unless she talks first.**


I've been dating my boyfriend John for a month. His flatmate, Jane, is a good friend of his who he works with. When Johns ex dumped him Jane offered her house to him. She insisted that he not pay any rent and they agreed that he stay for roughly a month. That was in January. 


When John first moved in Jane jumped him on the couch and tried to kiss him and initiate sex. John politely turned her down because he doesn't believe in sleeping with flatmates/coworkers. I'm honestly fine with this - I can understand being attracted to John :) I didn't even meet him until a month later. **I do not do anything ""couply"" with John in front of her. I have never kissed him or told him I liked him in front of her**. 


Jane and I were friendly at first but then she started becoming extremely passive aggressive. She suddenly refused to talk to either of us and would sometimes demand that we leave the house at 11pm because she ""wanted space"" and we couldn't come back until the next day... And even then John had to come back alone. On our first night as a couple she got drunk and started screaming on the phone at her friend about how much she hated John and wanted to live alone - she did this from like 8m away and knew we could hear her. I'm very conservative and shy around strangers so on the rare occasion she talks to me she likes to push subjects to try and make me uncomfortable, such as telling me to wear nipple tassels with her and discussing my breasts (her boyfriend I barely knew was next to her). 


Now, I'm of the belief that whoever has the house makes the rules so we should just shut up and deal with it until J"
32xztl,,"TYPO CORRECTION- OBESESSIVE GUY*****

So yes, I am in high school and this is all just teenage bullshit but I am genuinely concerned. I made friends with a guy at the beginning of freshman year, we bonded over video games and such. He started to become creepy obsessed. he would text me constantly even if I didn't reply, ask where I was if i didn't already tell him. He told me he had some issues with people leaving him, so I promised I wouldn't so long as he didn't turn into a total dick. He did. 

I had a boyfriend at first but we broke up and I finally came out that I was single. about a week later I guess he was going to ask me out. (wouldn't have said yes.) a guy that bullied him in middle school I guess beat him to it. I said yes to that guy. well this creepy obsessive guy (let's call him J) got so pissed off that he threw his backpack at a school computer. he got upset at me for saying yes and tried to convince me that my new boyfriend (let's call him D) didn't actually care and just wanted me for bragging rights. J got so weird that I began to ignore him, he would walk around school and stare at me, no matter where I was. His eyes followed me like one of those creepy paintings you see in museums. After I felt I got my space, I began to try and talk to him again because I felt obligated to, I promised I wouldn't leave. 

There was about a 6 month gap that I didn't talk to J. We starred talking more and more and one day he asked to see my tits. I said no, told him to fuck off and to not talk to me again. of course he tried to say it was a test but I just ignored him from then on. He tried to spit on me once, I ignored him then too. He started sending me emails telling me that I was the reason he was suicidal, that I should just die and that no one would miss me. I blocked him. well a few months ago he punched me. I pressed charges and now he is in anger management. 

Well Since then, D and I broke up (we were together for about a year and three months) and now h"
32yyh0,,"My friends and I were crossing some railway lines next to the train station. It was one of those crossings with heavy, magnetic gates with lights and sirens and disco balls that automatically lock the fuck up and let you know of the impending doom about 4 minutes  before the actual train comes. Anyway, on the other side of the track is an official-looking white van, and sitting in the front seat is this guy in a fluorescent haz jacket. He's sort of peering at us in a sort of *damned teenagers* sort of way.


I had my bike on me, so I let my friend pull the first gate open. I pushed my bike across the track, and waited for my friend to open the second gate for me. He had it open in a shake, and I guess one of my other mates said something funny, because I turned and gave him a smirk. I turned back to push my bike of the crossing and...

'Hey, GET OFF THE TRACKS!'

It was the guy in the van. He proper screamed it too, like he was nurturing some kind of righteous wrathful flame; like we had killed someone he loved. [High-level rage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dVld6JwgFc)

I was kind of offended. I'm a young person, and my friends and I aren't exactly the smartest-looking group (or should I say the most wealthy-looking... you get the image I'm building here). We get bad looks, we've had people threatening to call the police to kick us out of parks. It's mostly undeserved, and I'll admit I've had to apologise for being too boisterous or loud to a couple of upset parents. But this. Fucking. Guy. Was watching us through his little van window, probably stopwatch in hand, waiting for one of us to simply hesitate on these very empty, very safe railway tracks for two seconds, getting figuartively chubby at the thought of rightfully screaming at a bunch of low-down scum. I bet it made him feel very law-abiding and contributive (contribatory? contributa-tative? contribulory?) to the wellbeing of society to poke his head out of his company van, have a go, and smugly roll h"

He said I could and as I was about to sit down I heard ""no"" from the girl sitting in the seat across the one I was gonna take. I said ""God*DAMN* I wasn't even talking to you.""  No one really saw (and if they did they didn't care) but I could see that she was visibly embarrassed. I normally would not have been so rude but the way she said ""no"" had such a stuck up tone to it and while she said no, she scooted up in her seat as if I was going to dive to that seat like it was some huge honor sitting next to her. I would feel better if she had given me some bitchy remark or the stink eye but she looked embarrassed and kinda ashamed. So reddit-am I the asshole?"
330zse,,"Ok, backstory: so this girl (let's call her Julie) and I have been using all of our time together lately, i've probably been interested in her for 1½ year with just 1 girl in between i was interested in (let's call her sarah). I've never had the courage to say anything to Julie, because we've had a really good friendship, taking random roadtrips and all kind of things. 

This week we've been together each day after school, and was awaiting the big party yesterday, made costumes together even.

But yesterday was a horrible day for me atleast, but was it I who made the mistake?

The night starts with us being together at a pre-pre-party (yes this is a thing) with a couple others, she seems a bit distraught, looking away from me at all times, not her usual self, but I know she has a tendency to change quite a lot when she gets drunk and gets copenhagen. 

When we're at the pre-party she ignores me completely and tries to get away from the room i'm in at all times. I know i've been a bit pushy lately, and have been trying to get closer to her physically mostly. So i think that might have had an impact on her.

At the real party, we don't really meet more than once and the regular hug is rejected, she tries to avoid me. 

Then i meet Sarah. Sarah has a boyfriend now, and i even helped them get together, but she's been a good friend to me since she said no to me. So i told her of the story, and how i really like my best friend. She saw no solution but to go talk to Julie with me. When we find her, at a bar quite a bit away, she sits with a guy, same age as us, and i ask her if she wants to talk, she says no. She insists on not talking to me or Sarah, so i say to her that I will never speak with her again then. 

I also said i loved her in the same sentence, that might have something to do with it too. 

Important side note: Julie is moving to somewhere i can't go in two months, so this was really my last chance of doing anything with her, in a sense of relationship.

3349dq,,"When this happened my dad had been in his room, lying in bed for over an hour. When the phone rang my mom couldn't answer it my brother was whining, general chaos around the house. My dad yelled from his room ""someone get the phone"" which I thought was weird since he always has the phone with him. Anyway I answered it and it was my uncle asking for my dad. I said I thought he was asleep and offered to check to which he replied that it was ok and he would call later.

Detail: the phone is a landline phone so I couldn't leave my room while talking.

So, when I got out of the room my dad (still in his room with the lights off) asked me who was on the phone and when I told him he got really angry because apparently he was awake and I should have known that since he talked to me (refering to the yelling for someone to get the phone which he would have also done if he had been awakened by the phone). 

So, am I the asshole here?"
33507k,,"I'm in my late 20's and I'm reasonably settled in life. I'm hard-working, honest, and I try to be a good person, I really do. But there is this one girl that is really just too fucking much. I have reached my limits with her. She's 21 and we attend the same community college. 

I have never in all my fucking life heard anyone talk of grief, pain, and suffering the way this chick can. I'm supposed to be a good person so the first time she sat down next to me in the cafeteria and told me she had ""no one else to talk to about this"", I told her of course I'd listen. Well, *of course*, she immediately starts blubbering, carrying on like a Jewish widow. Cerebral palsy, autoimmune disease, abuse, rape, *pain, pain, pain.*

The first time, I really did listen and felt sorry for her. But after at least 20 fucking encounters like this- and I've only known her 6 months!- I just can't take it anymore. Yes, she had a traumatic surgery. And yes, she has an autoimmune disease that means she's sick six days out of seven. And yes, she's pretty sure she's gonna die before the year's out. Well, it's not *my* fault she was born 3 months early, now is it? Yes, it's gotta be hard being that sick all the time, but it isn't easy listening to it almost every goddamn day, either!!

I am so through with her. So you got sucked into an abusive relationship WHILE YOU WERE DATING SOMEONE ELSE?? Eventually you've gotta buck up and stop living in the past. I've heard her talk about how she was violated and then sent to a mental hospital so many times I can literally recite it word for word. I heard you the first time. I didn't need to hear the other fucking 19. 

Sure, life hasn't been kind to her. But that's just the way it is. Everything happens for some kind of purpose in the end. And no one is going to want to help you or care when all you do is sit on your fucking bed and cry about it ALL. DAY. LONG! You tell me about your issues with self-harm and that you occasionally starve yourself. So wha"
33bp7v,,"Alright, so by some weird anomaly, my sister and I share a Web Page Design class in the same period at our school. We sit right by each other (our choice since a lot of the kids in there are annoying as fuck) and I often help my sister do her work if she needs help, though I don't do it for her. When neither of us know the answer, we ask the teacher, and it gets resolved. No big deal. I'd say the closest I ever came to doing something for her was doing a full overhaul of her data files for a website, and that's it.

Now this one girl that sits next to her is, in as kind of words as I can say, a dumb and disrespectful bitch. She comes in late every day, leaves early, and acts like miss fucking priss every day. Like many people in our class, she simply begs the teacher every 5 seconds for him to help her, even though the instructions are very clearly printed in our textbook (quite literally spelled out step by step) and even though our teacher literally shows the entire class how to do the work in the front of the classroom. When she doesn't get help, she throws a fucking temper tantrum about it and says ""Well I guess I'll just fail the class then, I don't even care... Not my problem,"" to the teacher and everyone else.

Occasionally, she'll beg me for help when she sees me helping my sister, to which I will look her dead in the eyes and say, ""Do it yourself for once."" This doesn't happen a lot, but it has happened before. I only really say this because in my mind, if someone is a disrespectful little twat to the teacher and everyone around them, they don't deserve to be waited on hand and foot like that.

It's also fair to say that I do this to some other people sometimes when they try to copy off my work without asking. This isn't nearly as much as a problem, since they at least try and ask the teacher before creeping up on mine and others' screens.

Anyways, that's my story. Am I an asshole for doing this, Reddit?"
33oq8a,,"My flatmates are away and have let their friend sleep in their room for the next few weeks. As far as I'm aware, he's living here for free.

I just met him a couple of hours ago and he told me ""help yourself"" to a pizza that he'd just had delivered. I thanked him and took the two smallest slices and he looked at me shocked like I'd just murdered a puppy.

The two slices amounted to roughly 17% of the pizza. I took them because the had the least amount of topping (just one prawn in total).

He definitely said ""help yourself"" buuuut judging from his appearance/accent he's from South America so there may be a cultural difference there where it's said to be polite but a line should be drawn? I have no idea, I've lived in NZ all my life. "
33owqh,,"I'm 20/f and live with my parents. I told my parents I would be out late and asked them to not wait up for me because I didn't know what time I'd be home. 

So about 1:00 I get an angry text from both parents saying ""you're being extremely inconsiderate"" and ""you better get your ass home, now."" 

I understand that I live under their roof and it's their rules, but I pre-warned them. Is 20 not old enough to stay out past curfew? I've never been a bad kid. I've always done everything I can to appease my parents. These last couple years though, it's begun to affect my relationships. No man wants to hear, ""sorry we can't go out tonight, my parents want me home by 9:00."" So I've started venturing a little. Should I just stop until I move out?
Any advice on how to handle this is more than welcome!"

One of the checkouts is free, and has been for a good 20-30 seconds, which I noticed as I was approaching. There was a woman already standing at the line who was texting/facebooking/something on her phone, with two hands, and clearly focused on it.

I gave her another 20 seconds or so, and then:

I walked right around her without saying anything, and proceeded to scan my items. About 30 seconds later, she notices and walks over to me to confront me. She said as much as ""excuse me, I..."" before I interrupted her and said ""you were playing with your phone so I took your spot.""

I don't think I'd do this again because it was so negative and clearly not worth it, but AITA?

3431f4,,"My brother is known to be a a lying thief and he's been calling us for the past couple of weeks trying to find some money to buy some pain pills off the street. He's bullshitting about why he needs the money and my parents are falling for it and I know he's trying to get money to supply his habit. My parents do everything for him and enable his behavior. They always have.

Tuesday I started a new bottle of my ADD meds. Saturday, I accidentally left them out and he was at my house with his step daughter and his son. Sunday I open the bottle to take one and I notice that half of the bottle is gone. I recount a couple of times and I keep coming up 12 pills short of what I should have. I send my brother a text message demanding he brings the pills back. I know it was him because he was the only person around the bottle, I know he's looking for money and he can sell them, and the kids are too young to even know what they are. He ignores my messages for about and hour so I call my parents and tell them what happened, my Dad's response was, ""well, you shouldn't have left them out.""

My brother finally texts me back after I ratted him out to his wife (she's oblivious to all this because he snows her too) and he says he didn't take them, he has 120 of them and he'll give me the 12 I'm missing. No idea how he got 120 of them because he doesn't take ADD medication. On top of that, he said no one buys Adderall anymore and then blames the kids. He said he will bring me 12 pills out of his bottle later on that day. Sunday, ends and I see no pills.

This morning, my Dad tells me that my brothers truck was broken in to and someone stole the pills out of his truck (how convenient) and my Dad believes this bullshit because my brother told him he filed a police report and was going to the Dr. today to get a refill with the police report. I get really angry, tell my Dad that's a bullshit story and explain why. My Dad gets mad at me, tells me I'm getting the pills back (supposedly) and "
344hmq,,"So I can't physically go to prom with my girlfriend and she's too passive to say no to family and friends. She's going to prom no matter what. (I'm sure she'll  have lots of fun too.)

They're just friends and there's no chance of anything bad going on with them during prom, but I can't stop being so jealous.

3462ie,,"Hi guys. I'm sure this is going to piss a lot of people off but I think that's unavoidable. 

I work from home. The job I have, if done properly (read: at full effort), is stressful, toxic, and I hate it soooooo much. 

After doing it for 10 months, I got to a point where I was constantly on the verge of a panic attack due to the stress. I broke down sobbing, talking with my SO for hours about what alternative options I have. Here's what it boils down to:

-I have a degree, but no real experience in any field. This was my second job out of college, the first also being at this company. 

-If I quit now, I either end up a) back at a job just like this one (which defeats the point) or b) waiting tables like I did in college (oh god please not again) 

-This job pays enough for me to actually put money in a 401k and save for retirement. A minimum-wage job or waiting tables is only going to keep me afloat until I get another soulless corporate job. 

So I don't have a lot of good options, and having been raised to be *very* frugal and money-conscious, I can't bring myself to quit without a viable alternative.     

Basically when presented with these two opposing ideas (I hate my job so so so much vs. I can't afford to quit), my brain just snapped. I shut down. Stopped doing 80% of my work. Do only the bare minimum to get by. I think internally I just wanted to get fired so I could be free without feeling guilty for quitting.

And... nothing happened. My superiors are clueless. I don't do shit all day and nothing else has really changed.       

This is all kinds of fucked up, right? I feel like I'm in this weird limbo, with the constant expectation of getting fired that never actually happens. IDK. I feel like an asshole. But I have no idea what to do. "
347kov,,"So to preface: My brother and I have a ""lawn mowing business"" (just high schoolers mowing lawns to make money) and we have 4 lawns to mow around our house. I'm also a very fast mower. 

So I started mowing one persons (let's call this house rose's house) front yard and my brother started trimming (you know, with a weed whacker to get all the tight spaces and around trees/by fences and such). He said he'd get the backyard of roses house after he's done trimming, so I moved on to another yard. Two of the yards we have to now are connected, so I did those. At this time my brother started mowing the backyard of roses house. I then moved on to a backyard, and I finished it. I then did the other backyard, and my bro moved onto the last houses front yard. I started to put my mower away because I still had to blow off the lawn clippings, but he said that I need to help him finish the front and backyard of the house he was at. I said no, but I'll help you finish this little part in the front yard, so I did that, then got the blower and blew off all the lawn clippings at each lawn. He was barely done with the front yard at this point, but I went inside anyways. He was mad. He said that since I didn't work as long as him, I should get paid less.

For those not keeping score, by now I'm mowed 3.5 front yards and 2 backyards and I blew off the lawns. He's only trimmed (which he says is hard, I wouldn't know, I haven't done it ever)  and mowed 2 backyard and part of a front yard so I'm thinking, well screw you I did more work then you. (I didn't say that of course. But I did more work than him, and just because I'm fast at mowing, he thinks I should get less money. Am I the asshole?"
347wi8,,"I'm part of a fanpage on Facebook for a specific dubstep artist. Now every now and then I see those typical fishing for likes posts ('Anyone remember this song?' stuff like that), but recently I've seen more and more unrelated posts.

It started off with talking about other artists which isn't that bad, then it became dubstep-related 'maymays' which were cringey but eh... And then I see this particular post where someone posts a maymay about listeners of metal from 9gag.

I say it isn't related to dubstep and report it to the admin like we've been told. Next post I see says '[dubstep artist] is a metal head, and a lot of dubstep fans are metal heads (myself.) I don't see anything wrong with this here.' 

I say 'I am wearing shoes. Does that mean I can post about a shoe sale?' 
the guy then says something (which he's deleted now) about this not being a shoe group then posts a metal-dubstep song from [dubstep artist] and says 'So this isn't metal, huh?'


There's a bit more of an argument between that guy then another dude who took my side and then they make up by the guy on my side saying sorry and it just goes downhill from there. 

Then someone posts 'It's not a big deal and who the hell made you the meme police? GTFO with that attitude, it's all in good fun, let that shit go.'

I'm honestly just thinking of leaving this shitty group. All I see are these now and I'm sick of it.

So am I the asshole?

EDIT: Also, I know it's probably stupid of me to join any form of group on facebook but I thought it would be better than this.

EDIT 2: A guy just said 'And what if musicians like [dubstep artist] ""followed the rules""? We'd be stuck with more garbage pop music. As quoted by Picasso ""learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist"".

EDIT 3: ""The main rule is to have fun and be positive!"" Fuck you. 

Also I've just left, sick of this bullshit."
349o4w,,"The title really says it all. To give a tiny bit more context, I had gotten fed up with Facebook for a number of reasons and decided it was time to jump ship. As far as a decision goes, I stand by this one completely. The positives of this decision are reinforced every day (and this is 6 months ago now).

The problem is, when I deleted my account, that's all I did. I didn't write ""one last post"", or contact close friends to tell them, or anything. Basically, I got a few texts within the weeks following delete-day from people asking if I was ok, or if I was still friends with them IRL. Some people that I certainly consider to be friends didn't have my number or email, and so they couldn't reach me anymore, and I couldn't reach them either.

TL;DR deleted FB, people found out on their own and in some cases assumed the worst (hated them, moved to Timbuktu, etc)."
34dqkn,,"I've realised that the way I've worded the title makes me seem like the asshole already, but hear me out.

I live in a rented 6 bedroom house with 5 other students. We all work monday to friday, 09:00 to 17:30. A housemate of mine decided at 22:45 that she wanted to use the tumble dryer, as I was climbing into bed. I got up and the conversation went something like this:

*For further clarification, the house we live in is shit. The tumble dryer is located on top of the washing machine, and no matter how hard we try, the thing will rattle and push itself up against the wall outside my door, and shake into the wall constantly until it is finished. Myself and one other person live on the bottom floor, the other 4 people live upstairs.*  

**Me:** ""Hey, please can you use the tumble dryer in the morning so that I can sleep now.""  
**Upstairs room-mate:** ""I can't CIDC, as I need dry underwear for tomorrow morning at work.""  
**Me:** ""Well I need sleep. Can you put the underwear you need dried out to air tonight, and then use the tumble dryer in the morning? It'll be dry by the morning.""  
**Upstairs room-mate:** ""No, it needs to be dried in this tumble dryer.""  
&amp;nbsp;


So she proceeds to start it for 50 minutes, and goes upstairs. I turn it off as soon as she leaves, and get back into bed. A minute or so later, I hear her come down and start it again. I go outside and so begins the argument where she says that I can keep turning it off, but she will continue to turn it on again. Eventually, I decide to just let her win and I lay awake for the entire time the dryer is banging against my wall. 

Cut to 6.30am, and I hear her come downstairs and run the machine AGAIN for another half an hour. Now I'm completely sure this was out of spite.

2lcln7,,"today i was very busy studying for my nursing classes and didnt get much sleep the night before. i have 2 tests next week and several quizzes so i need to put as much focus on my ability to study/study as i can. im young (19) so i still live with my mom. just as i was hitting burnout she texted me asking to put the dishes up. i respond that im going to take a short nap (ive slept very little this week) but will do it when i wake up. ok. no problem.

i wake up to slamming dishes in the kitchen. my moms boyfriend (who has lived with us for 5 months) was home, and is very anal about cleanliness. sure enough he was pissed off that he got home and the dishes werent done or put away. so i go over there and help him. hes still angry though, because apperently he asked my siblings to do some chores and they didnt do them. this bit of detail isnt me thinking hes an asshole, its just the events that will lead up to what im asking about.

so my mom gets home to see him all stern-faced and asks him whats wrong. no comment. mom says ""ok..."" and shakes it off. she asks him to hand him something from the sink. he threw it in her direction with an attitude. mom got mad at him and told him not to ever do that. he ignored her and gave her the silent treatment for the next 2 hours. this made me mad. i mean, i never really have been involved in a healthy relationship so i dont know whats normal, but this isnt is it? i see it as childish.

not long after that her boyfriend called me over because he needed help printing something off facebook, so i did it. i dont remember how the conversation got started, but he was talking about how his biological daughter cusses him out sometimes and hes surprised i havent yet. now, hes dating my mom for the long haul so i said ""im sure i will eventually. heck, i expect us all to cuss eachother out at some point"". what i meant was that all families get in big fights and im sure we will too. i dont normally cuss AT people though. im more inclined to say"
2lp307,,"I'm in the drive-through at McDonald's.  It's rush hour and pretty busy. The last two times I was there, they screwed up the order in a way that you couldn't see until you unwrap or open everything.  So this time, when I get my order I open each sandwich wrapper before I drive away to make sure things are right.  The guy behind me blasts his horn repeatedly as if I'm sitting at a green light.  

Now, I understand his point.  Even if he knows exactly what I'm doing, he probably thinks I should pull forward to let him get to the window before I spend everyone's time checking on my order.  But I don't want to do this because if they did screw it up, I'll have to park, go inside, and explain it to someone who had nothing to do with it (or drive around and wait behind at least 4 cars).  Also, since I sat and waited at that window for at least a half minute before they showed up with food, I don't think I wasted any time that made a difference to the next car.  

So, was I being a jerk?"

2m3i30,,"My sister was/is planning on going to a Taylor Swift concert with my mother. She needed $150 per ticket but didn't have enough. She asked me if she could borrow $200 to buy the two tickets so I gave it to her with promise she'd pay me back in her coming paycheck.

The next day I get a call from her saying she accidently bought tickets in the wrong section and needed to borrow my credit card to buy a new set of tickets. This caught me off guard and she and I have not been on the best of terms because of unrelated events - to summarize pissing her off will end very very badly for me in my current position, but I don't think she realizes that. Because of this I reluctatly gave her my card number so she could buy the second pair of tickets. 

The second pair cost $329 total. So at this point I'm out $529.

She's since payed me back $100 of this. Still out $429.

I jokingly told her that she should split the profit with me or atleast give me a cut when she sells the other tickets.

She responded rather emotinally saying I was being selfish and that she needed the extra money to put into her savings account.

She currently has the other tickets listed for $450 EACH meaning she'd be making over $500 off of what I lent her and had to inconvenience myself to lend to her.

Am I the asshole for expecting a cut of the profit when she put me on the spot to lend her money then later revealed she was only buying the second set to flip them?"
2mg9gm,,"So I'm a college student living in a typical dorm setup.  There is a kid (""Joe"") who lives across from me, who, frankly, I don't like very much.  He's not a bad person, just very immature and a bit annoying.  Due to the fact that he lives across the hall from me and is not intolerable, we hang out a little bit.  Never one on one, but more like I'll sometimes be in there when there's a group drinking some beers, watching a game or whatever.  This one time we were in the dining hall with a group and he expressed interest in going to hit on this girl who he knows from class.  Knowing him, it was a slightly embarrassing attempt at anything, mostly due to his absurd confidence in his ability to ""pick up chicks"".  The girl was not into it.  Bottom line: I knew Joe was interested in this particular girl.

Fast forward a couple days.  It was a typical dorm room Friday with people getting drunk in various rooms before going out for the night.  My usual crew ended up in his room that night and everyone was having a good time.  People are always coming in an out, and within a half hour of being there, said girl walks in with a couple friends.  Somehow she ends up sitting on the couch next to me and we really hit it off.  To make a long story short we hooked up that night.  And the next.  Since we did meet in Joe's room, Joe is very aware of this fact.  He's pretty pissed at me now and is giving me the cold shoulder and slammed the door on my friend who asked if he wanted to come hang out with us in my room.  Am I the asshole?  How should I proceed?  

I'm obviously aware of how this hurt his feelings and why he's reacting this way, but it didn't stop me from letting stuff happen with the girl.

2mizud,,"I've been looking to sell my PS4 for a while and my brother (who was visiting for the weekend) offered to but it for 160 dollars. Now I'm pretty desperate to get rid of the thing since I've built my own PC and now never use the ps4, but 160 dollars is a laughable offer. I rejected the offer very quickly since I know they're going for about 340 on average on eBay. He proceeded to not talk to me the rest of the day and his last words before leaving the house to go to the airport was ""don't be so selfish eh?"". Should I have been generous and given the console to him for 50% off due to our blood relationship or was I justified in refusing the offer? For a little context, I'm 17, so money is harder to come by at my age then at his (he's 34). And it's not like I wasn't going to give the price a little leeway, I was willing to go down to 230. Anyways, enough excuses, tell me how it is. "

2muqyf,,"I have been working at this job for a few years now. Earlier this year management told us that they want to hire some younger people in their teens/twenties *(their friends kids)* who would do what they say without question. 

I went from working six days a week to two. I took this as an opportunity to go to school with all of the new free time. The new worker that has my shift has decided they wanted to start taking classes and asked me could I take back my Mondays.  *I told them I don't know about that, and I don't know if I want to since they removed me from those days in the first place. Plus you can't make any schedule changes without talking to management anyway.* 

So I'm not suppose to see them again to Thurs but I come in on Tues and they are in my spot. The manager comes in and ask what happened to me taking the co-workers spot on Monday. I told her that I never agreed to take their spot. The manager turned and asked them I thought you said /u/PM_Me_YourDong  agreed to switch with you. The co-worker tried to say I agreed but I corrected them again and the manager told the co-worker this was their fault. Now they are acting angry at me. 

I think what made me angry about this is that she could make a change to my schedule without the manger talking to me to confirm it. Sorry for the wall of text, but Am I the asshole?

2n7yd9,,"Yesterday I went by train to another town, as I had an appointment. Now the train I knew was going to take a while and so I took a book with me. Now the book I'd chosen was  *Na Drini Ćuprija*, a well known Serbian book. Even if you didn't know it was Serbian the Cyrillic writing on the front was prominent enough that someone would know that it wasn't English. 

  Now the train was busy but I managed to find a seat in a corner and I just quietly got on with reading. Now a couple of seats down this man kept looking at me and muttering something I couldn't quite hear. My guess is that he saw the book and just assumed I was non-English speaking or something.

After a while he became more vocal and I could hear stupid comments about how I 'should' be reading in English and how it was 'disgusting' that I was in public like I was. 

  I proceeded to loom directly in his direction quite audibly call him a rather rude name in Serbian (budala, meaning fool or idiot). This was more to make him aware that I was hearing him than anythiing else, and he seemed to shut up. 

 About 5min later he began chanting 'EDL, EDL' and making comments about how I.should be deported, as well as a number of comments like ''England's for English people only"". By this point a lot of people on the train were getting irritated as they just wanted a peaceful trip. But no-one did anything. 

 By this point I got ridiculously pissed because I just wanted to resd in peace. I got up out of my seat, went over to him and got right in his face. I was so pissed off however that I initially spoke to him in Serbian, telling him ""da, govorim srpski jezik. Da li imate problem?!"". (Yes, I speak Serbian. Do you have a problem?""). Then I shouted at him in English that he needed to keep his pathetic pea-brained opinions to himself among other things. 

Chances are that he didn't actually understand what I said to him initially, and I'm wondering if this, or my whole confrontation with him pushed me into asshole ca"
2nfj2m,,"I was born with an anxiety disorder that has slowly destroyed my life since I was 13. I've gone through 2 psychiatrists and 1 psychologist specializing in neuro-feedback therapy. After dozens of therapy sessions, emergency hospital visits, and thousands of dollars worth of medical debt, my only form of control over my anxiety has been taking xanax for the past 6+ years. 

I've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years and my anxiety disorder has yet to be fully understood by her. We've had arguments before about it and she's said things like, ""Everyone stresses out all the time, you're not alone in this"" and ""All you need to do is thing positive thoughts and relax"" or ""Being addicted to drugs isn't the answer"". She can't seem to grasp the uncontrollable, life grasping, dark and depressing nature of anxiety and how it is a mental disorder and not just a mood swing. I think it's because she and her family have never dealt with mental disorder before and, like many of us redditors deal with, have no idea what the solution or results are.

So I went to her dentist's office today because I wanted to try a new dentist. When I went today, I asked her dentist if she could schedule the first cleaning for another time because I have anxiety and I need to take medicine to be able to be calm through even the most basic medical procedures. In fact, I start to hyperventilate, get short breath, and panic when I go to job interviews if I don't take xanax beforehand. So her dentist totally understood and told me she's there to make things as comfortable as I need. I was on the phone with my girlfriend just talking about my day and I told her this bit and she says, ""Why didn't you let her just do the cleaning? She would have let you relax or calm down if you needed to"" but it's not as simple as that. If I begin to get an anxiety attack, it will take a lot of downtime for me to get past it and the experience of it is too horrible for me to willingly go through. I tried to tell my girlf"

43mo0f,,"I've [31m] been seeing her [23f] for quite a while, and it's been somewhat casual, but its starting to get a little more serious.

Sometimes she stays at mine, sometimes I stay at hers. I wake up insanely early for work sometimes and in that case I'll stay at hers, get up, and go without disturbing her. If she's at mine she has to leave when I do because she doesn't have a key and I'll be gone for like 12 hours. So on two occasions, most recently last night, I have asked if I could call her a cab home so she could stay at hers.

Last night she was clearly upset about it. We had spent 24 hours together, and had a great time. She knew I was waking up early and had planned not to sleep over. She ended up starting to fall asleep in my bed. I dropped some hints saying I'm gonna get ready for bed, get washed up. She continues to get deeper into sleep and kinda isn't going anywhere.

I'd like to explain myself. If she's okay with waking up at 6 with me and being out the door by 6:30 with me so I'm not late, fine. But last time we tried this she was a huge grump about waking up, slowed me down quite a bit and it we agreed it wasn't the right choice. Also, she agreed last night with the reasoning that going home was better than getting woken up early. Then she fell deep asleep.

Anyway when it comes down to it I gently but firmly say I'm sorry but you have to wake up and go, I'll book you a cab. She wakes up, is pissed. Later when she says she's home and I apologize for it and she says not to worry. Today she's being cold, distant, and I feel like I did something wrong. The subtext of ""don't worry about it"" might be ""fuck you"".

Am I the asshole?"
43shte,,"Backstory: I just turned seventeen, and I got a new car, with some financial help from my parents. Next year I will drive to school, while paying for the gas, paying the $85 parking fee, and general maintenance on the car. 

My parents asked me to drive my sister (a freshman next year) everyday to school with me. When I said I wouldn't like to, considering it was my first time to drive alone after ten years of taking the bus, they simply said to do it or don't drive the car. My sister has only given $20 to the parking fee, and won't contribute to gas at all. I feel it's unfair that she'll have two years of getting free rides while I'm forced to take her. AITA for not wanting to give her free rides?

440ojn,,"Got a new roommate this last week, he's a cool guy so far and understanding it seems. I already have 3 male cats, all neutered. I gave him permission to bring his cat with him and we'll see how he gets along with my boys. Turns out he's not fixed and in less than 24 hrs he has already sprayed in the house and it smells awful. I got up early and had to leave for work and didn't see my roommate to talk about it but I'm already fed up and ready for the cat to be gone. I'm pretty sure he could keep his cat at his moms house or something but I'm not sure. He won't be living with me very long, only a couple weeks before he moves to texas for a job thing. Would I be an asshole if I told him he can't have his cat at my house until he moves out?


UPDATE: I got home from work and only one of my roommates (not the one with the cat) was home too. I said hello to all the kitties including the new guy, and he was being kinda sweet but all of a sudden attacked the shit out of my arm. Not like a nip, but full blown wrapped around my arm and attacked my forearm. He then continues to be a dick to my other cats who were just playing nice. I had enough when he tried to fuck with my old man kitty who does literally nothing but sleep all day and mind his own business. I tried to shoo him away and he got all defensive like he was going to attack me again for it. I've had cats all my life and this one was starting to scare the shit out of me. I ended up getting him by the scruff and booting him to his bedroom. My other roommate was around when this was happening and telling me he's pissed about the cat too.

My roommate came home moments after that, and before I had even said hello, my other roommate came up and immediately told him how much he hates the cat already. He was meowing loud as fuck all night and he pointed out the piss problem and also brought up that he had attacked my arm (which I told him about after it happened).

Yet somehow, in 3 out of the last 5 discussions I haven't been able to tell which actual judgement the top commenter agrees with.  Usually, the comment gives advice that spells out that the OP needs to change what he's doing to solve a problem he's created but includes a statement like ""you're not an asshole"".  To me, it seems like these commenters absolutely think OP is at fault, but are too timid to say it in the terms we ask, so they waffle and imply, and we're left to guess what flair is right.

You're just saying that in the limited scenario that OP is describing, he is the person that should be blamed for the conflict that he's asking about.

44bijz,,"So, for the last while, my friend and I have been looking forwards to seeing Kung Fu Panda 3 together. We didn't, however, make a plan for a specific day. It'd probably happen this weekend or the next, but nothing was stated.

(I'm a guy and she's a girl if that makes any difference.)

Yesterday, she came up to me and a few friends and mentioned that a guy (he's an acquaintance to both of us) asked her to seeing the movie tonight. I'd have just joined them, but I'm busy on thursday nights.

Now, I feel like it's kind of rude to just agree to seeing a movie with some other person when we'd been planning on seeing it together for a while. If I was planning on seeing a movie with someone, then someone asked me to seeing it,  I think my opinion here would be stronger if we had made a specific plan, but sadly we didn't.

I didn't exactly want to be rude, or try to control her choices, but she figured out that I was a bit upset about it pretty quickly. She said she could still see it with me another time, which I guess is true, but I still feel like it's kind of rude. Another friend of ours who was there said he agreed with me.

She said she would be fine with saying no to him. She also explained that she didn't actually say yes to the guy, but said she'd think about it. (She also apologized for making it seem like she had said yes, which I don't think she needed to apologize for.)

I feel like I was justified, obviously, but I'm also worried that I wasn't."
44f5mp,,"Okay obviously I'm going to have to give you a fair bit of context here. Otherwise I = asshole based on title alone.

It's a little more complicated than that, and here's why.

 
* Been a relationship with current s/o 5 years. 
* Last year I **Attempted** to break it off due to not really being intimate enough to deem it a ""relationship"" anymore. 
* Starting seeing said Ex (who was the nicest guy to me and I still feel shit for having to explain giving original bf another chance)

Now, this is where it sorta.. warps. 

I got back with long term bf. 
He begged, second chances, amirite? (I still felt like I loved him enough to at least try PLUS 5 years is a long time to just *forget*)


Ex messages me on Fb a month or so after and ongoing until now. Asks how I am, wanted to remain friends.. which I was ok with. Nothing romantic about it. Just ""How was your day/ how are your parents"".. type deal.

Come to present day. Ex attempts to organize a ""trip"" to come see me/ me go see him. Sends, and I quote, ""When are you leaving that other crap behind"". Bf sees this and flat out says I don't want you to talk to him anymore etc... 

I said ok, let me explain to ex what is going on. (I felt like I had to, otherwise he would drive up (2+ hours drive) only to not be able to see me)


I send him, and I quote, ""[Bf's name] dislikes me conversing with you.. i can see why.. i mean i did sleep with you. , anyway that and its just starting to make me realize what the fuck i did..  it's not going to happen anymore. don't worry about coming up alright."" and I sent another one straight after "" i dont want you to waste your time on me anymore""

Bf flips an even BIGGER shit.  Now I'm in the doghouse for wanting to clear things up.

AITA for wanting to let Ex at least know what is going on? 

tl;dr - Ex is the kind of person to make spur of the moment decisions, such as random road trips (at least, while we were together). **Wanted to make sure he didn't waste his time/ money on fuel/gas to "
44fvkx,,"So I have 2 flatmates, and all of us had one set of keys each to the apartment. We are all students living in the apartment because we study abroad. One of the flatmates forgot his keys at his parent's house when he came back after the winter break. So one day before he went out he asked me quickly if I was going to be home later tonight to open the door for him, I quickly said yes, forgetting that I had a class later. So I went on the day and just before the class started I remembered it and ran there. I forgot I said I'd be home because of the stress. After the class, I went by my friend's place (which is about 5 mins from our apartment) and we all decided to go eat in town and called a cab. I then checked my phone and the flatmate was locked out and I asked him to come and get the keys from my friend's apartment, because we had a cab waiting (I didn't tell him about the cab until later). He got really pissed about having to go all the way to my friend's place. 
I've known him a while before and we casually hung out but I started to realize he's quite selfish and arrogant, and he was generally a bad flatmate (e.g. not washing dishes/cleaning after him even after pointing it out). Apparently he thought everything was cool and didn't know I thought that way.

Am I the asshole?"
44iyrg,,"Ok, so story is...

I moved in with a couple friends I have known for years, Susan and Jenna. I am blunt, direct and sometimes called a “confrontational” communicator. I am a male and they are both females. Susan says I have issues with talking aggressively and being too confrontational in the way that I speak normally, this is hard for me to understand as I am just trying to communicate myself to the best of my ability, so that the other person can understand me, its hard to “pull back” on how I talk as I tend to think people are being too sensitive about how I'm delivering the message. To quote her, “Its not what I'm saying but HOW I'm saying it”. When Jenna and I get into it I tend to fall back on logic when I'm arguing, I want things to be fair, even if I'm wrong (I'm totally fine with being wrong, a person just has to prove to me with facts that I am wrong before I will agree with them) and she usually has a hard time using logic when defending her reasoning, more often Jenna just wants to feel what she is feeling and she wants me to accept that. Even if logically it makes zero sense and I disagree with her. We have since stopped being friends because of this kind of conflict, Jenna says she doesn't like being around me anymore because according to her “I don't let her feel feelings in her own house”. So my question is am I actually an asshole for having an opinion, disagreeing with her about her logic and not saying its ok to feel a certain way when I don't agree with her reasoning or am I totally within my rights as an individual and a friend by being honest with her because to me that is what a true friend would do?

44kgoj,,"I've been living with my best friend  I met at  the start of college for the past year. We always were a duo freshman year, so sophomore year we moved into the same place. I'm pretty sure he expects me to live with him next year as well, but I don't know if I can. I'm a very clean person and he's the complete opposite. What he does:

•leaves clothes on our shared bathroom floor for days

•forgot to flush poop more times than I can count 

•pees in the middle of the toilet as loud as possible, my room right next to bathroom

•leaves a bunch of our dishes in his room for weeks

•rarely, if ever, washes dishes (no dishwasher) if I don't wash them they will be in the sink for weeks, even when I talk to him multiple times about it

•never takes out trash

•takes hour long showers everyday, fucking our water bill. ""What, I like to be clean""

•leaves empty cans, cups, plates, and trash on the counter

•often doesn't clean up spills on counter

•leaves his light,lamp, ceiling fan, bathroom light, and bathroom fan on all the time, fucking our water bill

•leaves rotten food in the fridge (stuff has leaked on my food before from it)

•never cleans the bathroom

•even dirties the bathroom right after I clean it, even when I tell him multiple times to please keep it clean

•leaves beard hair all over the sink, when I tell him to clean it, he doesn't even do a half assed job, like quarter assed

We live with two others that are equally irritated, but they share their own bathroom. But like I said, he's been my best friend since the beginning. although,  I was the one who found our place and set everything up(lease signing,meetings,viewing, everything) when he wouldn't even bother to search. He's not malicious, he's just not the sharpest knife in the drawer(more like a spoon) completely oblivious. I don't want any bad blood between us if I tell him I can't live with him, so I want to know if im the asshole or if he is before I decide."
44noh2,,"Ok let's start with a little backstory. I'm in college and my roommate I got along pretty well, at least I thought so, and we were/are friends. I don't think were like super close friends but I feel like we were/are friends. So now on to the actual story. For the purposes of this story lets call my roommate John. 

About a week ago my roommate (John) was kicked completely out of the dorms at my school. John and another friend (lets call him Brian) were involved in a situation that got them kicked off campus, totally unrelated to this story though. So yesterday John and Brian moved into a new place off campus and they invited a bunch of other friends (who I consider friends too) over to help them move in and had a little housewarming party and stuff. I wasn't explicitly invited but I texted John about it and asked him whether I could come and he never replied. He had just texted me less than 5 minutes before... Do they not want me there or do they just not care enough to invite me? Am I the asshole for being pissed about them not inviting me?  Was I wrong to assume they would invite me? Should I have just gone with my suitemate who was going even though they did not specifically invite me? 

EDIT: 
Update: John and Brian are having a superbowl party tonight. I thought I might just tag along with my suitemate, see their new place, say hi, whatever. Texted my suitemate and he said he couldn't take me because he was going straight there from where he was. He just stopped by to grab some stuff. He was here for 10 minutes and got some stuff and got my other suitemate. I walked in and said hi, asked if they were going to the superbowl party, to which they said yes, then stood there awkwardly and then went back to my room. They just left, now it seems to me the my ex-roommate specifically doesn't want me there. I think i'm just talking the whole thing up in my head and jumping to conclusions but i'm not sure. "
44qtnf,,"Ok so this one has a lot of factors but I'll try to keep it short.

Last year my gf and I decided to move in together, but seeing as we're both university students without much of an income, it was difficult to find a landlord who would agree to have us as tenants.

Eventually we got word from a family friend. Her coworker was moving out of his flat and he'd show us around.

He is a very nice guy and I think he liked us, too, because he told his brother, who owns the flat, that we seem like nice and responsible people.

Here's where it gets tricky. The flat he was moving into already had a kitchen installed, meaning he couldn't take his old one with him, so he asked if we'd buy it off him. It's about two years old and he'd paid 4000€ for it. He told us his price was a negotiable 3000€, which is far too much for us, but we agreed to negotiate a price for it, should his brother let us sign the lease.

To our surprise, we actually got the flat. The landlord told us he didn't care if we bought his brother's kitchen or not. When it came to negotiating a price, we could only get it down to 2000€, though. Still too much for us, especially since you can get small kitchens for like 800.

We told him we'd buy one ourselves, while he put his on ebay for 2800. We did, in fact, buy a nice kitchen for 800.

About 10 days before moving out, I got a text from the guy, saying nobody will buy his kitchen and he'd sell it to us for 1500€.

I responded that we'd already bought one, and cancelling the order will cost us a quarter of the retail price as compensation for the store, so 200€.
Should we take his kitchen instead, we'd only make a profit if he'd sell it to us for 600. We were, however, feeling a bit sorry for him so we made the offer to buy his for 1000, effectively costing us 1200 because of the compensation.

He said he'd think about it.

The next day he sent me a text saying his parents think 1000€ is not enough, so they'll buy it themselves and leave it in the flat, lettin"

44tmnu,,"So on like Wednesday of last week, my girlfriend and I had gone to one of my friends home to chill. Everything goes well blah blah blah. We leave later realize she thinks she left her (expensive) glasses at his house. We try to go back to get them but friend is no longer there. So we try on 3 different occasions to go and get them back but friend is not home every time we try (for legitimate reasons). Basically it's been a week and she calls me at work telling me how she searched all over her room, and her vehicle, and then my vehicle searching for the glasses but can not find them. So she tells me they have to be at (lets call him Joe) Joes house which is fine we suspected they were there anyways. However she starts talking a ton of shit saying how if hes lying shes going to whoop his ass and blah blah she goes off on me laying into my friend joe for not returning her glasses already. I tell her at first calmly how if they are there she will have them returned as soon as we can all meet up and look for them in his house. She does'nt want ot listen and keeps going on about how he is a liar and all this so i got pretty pissed off and tell her that its not joes fault she left them there and that he has searched and can not find them, and im kind of annoyed so my tone is a little stern. however she wont listen to me so i eventually tell her its not our fault she lost her glasses and she cant blame me or him and that i dont want to talk to her until she calmed down then i hung up on her. am i the asshole for (kind of) yelling at my girlfriend and hanging up on her?

Some background info: Joe is lifelong friend of 22 years (literally known him since i was born no exageration) so i know he is not lying

I basically told her that its not our fault she lost it and that its probably at his house anyways and not to talk to me until she calmed down

She basically said that shes pissed at my friend *Joe* for hiding her glasses and not returning them suspecting hes (forgive me b"
44uq5b,,"I probably am. Here's some back story:

Something recently came up where I realized I was really upset by a statement my bf made. It was along the lines of: ""although I do like pleasuring you, it is a bonus. I'm primarily motivated to have intercourse to meet my own needs and self pleasure. It can be mentally stimulating, but generally I can't get turned on by doing so. Foreplay is more or less a chore since I initiate everything, anyway.""

So I tried to bring this up the other night, and I know that it probably wasn't the kindest way to put it, I just wanted to be honest because I realized that in a sense, it scarred me.

I lead with, ""I didn't realize how much *statement* bothered me until I realized that I'm sometimes more put off and feel less inclined to do anything to pleasure you, I'm sorry."" 
To which the first words that came out of his mouth are: ""I don't know what you want me to say.""

 He did at a point claim that there is no guy in the world that thought differently, which I then started to compare him. I explained that the only reason why I'm comparing him with my friends is the fact that I wanted him to understand where I'm coming from, and why it's not ridiculous for me to expect something different because my friends have told me otherwise. 

I said, ""That's definitely not true, my friends Bob and Nick told me that they actually get physically turned on by being able to please their SO. It exists.""

And before he stormed out, he said ""Well shit, I'm so sorry I'm so shitty to you.""

I really care about him and honestly don't know how to communicate this in an any more effective or nicer approach, so any tips would be greatly appreciated. Although I know this isn't an advice forum... thanks!

451501,,"So, I don't think I am the asshole in this situation for my actions, I'm just curious if I'm an asshole and getting upset about something dumb, or if this is a legitimate reason to be pissed at someone. I have some mental illness and as a result I have a bit of a victim complex. I hashed this out with my fiancé many times, at first he said its no big deal, now after hearing the same story many times he says he sees why I'm upset. But Id like some fresh perspective.


So there's this girl I work with, let's call her Sue. Sue is a friend of mine, we actually hang out outside of work, we talk at great lengths about personal matters. I've known her for years. She has been with her boyfriend for 6-7 years, they lived together at Sue's parents up until about a year ago when they got a place of their own. For a great deal of their relationship, he did not work, just generally a deadbeat.

I have been with my partner relatively shorter, we have been together around 2 and a half years. Our relationship was rocky at the start, and had quite a few on-and-off hiccups (again- mental illness). I got the help I needed and completed therapy, he worked through his issues, and things were good for awhile, so this past summer we moved in together. In December he proposed. (Yay!)

Now, as excited as I was that he got down on one knee and gave me jewelry, it wasn't really a ""surprise."" We had been talking marriage for the last year, and around the time we moved in together, we began making plans. We wanted something small- either just going away and eloping, or a courthouse ceremony with our family. We (well, I) decided it would be nice to have more family there, so we wanted to put the wedding on the back burner until we have the funds, and I told him I might like a ring. And he got me a ring! 

Now Sue was very unsupportive of the ""eloping"" idea. She kept insisting it was too soon, and we needed to wait to get to know each other better. And I could see where she was coming from, as in"
45278h,,"Hi again! I seem to have a real knack for dog drama.

This time, my mom got a puppy. I am a Sophmore, I have my own dog. She gets walks for exercise. One in the morning and one in the afternoon if I can get home before dark.

I was against it from the start, and so was my brother. My mom has two toddlers at home, and my stepfather works all day. No one has any time for a puppy.

But in the end they did it, and it's their choice. We tried to warn them.

So the thing about Leo the Puppy is that we have to take him to pee every three hours, even during night. At first I did it, because my mom and stepdad went on vacation the day after we got Leo. (I was supposed to be paid, but instead I got a screaming match. That's a different story however.)

They come back, and now my mom takes over Leo, because my stepdad can't. We're all fine and dandy, I babysit him sometimes, he's cute.

Then my mom decides to move his crate to downstairs in the garage. It's easier for her, my stepdad and my brother to get it, but I'm upstairs with my dog (with separation issues), so it's a bit of a trip. 

Then my mom snaps.

Now she starts texting us rapidly while we're in school, going on about how she hates Leo and she can't do it and we need to take a few shifts each (suggesting times such as 9pm, midnight and 3am).

I was perfectly okay with a couple shifts, if she moved the crate back upstairs. I could do the 6am shift for her so she could sleep and I could let him out and still eat breakfast. We have a door upstairs to the deck and he can walk down to the place we normally let him out.

My mom did not want to move the crate again. She called me selfish, and told me if I didn't do it she'd shut my phone off.

I told her again- I can't do the 6am shift if he's downstairs, and still have time to eat breakfast. I don't have much time in the morning- I get up at 5, walk my own dog, and have a quick bite to eat before the bus gets here. If I handle Leo, I can't eat, or my dog can't get exerci"

The wedding is not in my hometown, but 300+ miles away so I would be away the entire weekend.

We know each other through a mutual friend and became FB friends after being thrown together when our friend was in a crisis. I've interacted with her basically two times over the last 12 years or so: when we were both in our friend's wedding 12 years ago and, recently, to help our friend. 

Usually, I try really hard to refrain from engaging in political discussions on FB. Every once in awhile, though, I go ahead and take the bait. And this is what happened this time."

Yesterday Bob and I were shooting the shit, with Adam jumping in here and there, when suddenly Charlie pops up with ""CAN YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN, I CAN'T EVEN HEAR THIS GUY ON THE PHONE."" He was pretty angry, and understandably so - we were definitely being loud, and not even for work stuff; Charlie was actually in the middle of a work call. We shut up right away.

Now today, we're all talking about not-necessarily-work-stuff, but the volume starts creeping up. At which point, I throw out ""EVERYONE SHUT UP CHARLIE'S ON THE PHONE."" (He wasn't.) Man, he got PISSED. Called us douchebags and said ""Sorry I actually show up to work, instead of talking about [Bob's and my mutual hobby] all day."" (And yes, we do talk about it a good bit, but not at the expense of getting our work done. More to keep ourselves sane than because we're fucking off.)

I let a few minutes passed, then apologized via our IM program, and said, ""Hey, sorry if I touched a nerve. I don't think you were wrong to ask us to shut the hell up yesterday."" To which he replies, ""pretty fucking low to give me shit for trying to work a serious issue yesterday.""

I think he's still kinda pissed. But I did apologize, and sincerely. I know I probably *was* an asshole, but am I still? Is there anything else I need to do in terms of offering an olive branch?

EDIT/UPDATE: He's still been pissed all day, not reacting to any of my normal banter/jokes with other coworkers, but laughing at theirs and making his own. I mean, not just a week ago I had him and his wife over to my house for dinner. What the fuck.

I have to get on the first train to make it to work on time. This is also about the time that the elderly start their day. It's nice that they're trying to support themselves (not nice that they have to), but they do shit that makes travelling about as inconvenient as possible. I don't know about other countries, but the rule of standing by the side of the subway doors to let people out is actually written here, and somehow there are always at least a few people, invariably old, who think they're exempt. They'll stand right in the middle of the door to get on asap. Some stand aside when they see people want to get out, but others push their way in.

At my stop at the end of the line, and probably others, they'll squeeze at the door and once they open, sprint to the stairs. This is actually okay. They have the right of way (remember we're getting off now), and everyone wants to get out quickly. I have a shuttle bus to catch, and they might have one too. But once they reach the stairs, they slow to a fucking crawl, making a wall of slowness that holds up everyone behind them. I can understand they can't descend as fast as younger people, but don't fucking rush to the front if you're not at least moving at an average pace. You only get a benefit of being in front if you're faster than  the guy in front of you.

When it was time to leave, I dialed up uber. At this point my mom geek asleep. When the uber driver arrived, I started to carry my backpack and the kid's booster seat outside. The booster seat's back and seat kind of click together, and at this stage they became unhinged. As I was fumbling my way outside, I asked my brother ""could you go get her please?""

I struggled to put the booster seat together. Apparently I had left the front door open (however I did not realize this at the time). When I turned around, there she was next to the car. I was pretty annoyed, as I never let her near the street without an adult holding her hand. She tends to run around a lot and not pay attention. 

So I say to him ""did you really let her run out into the street like that,"" to which he responded ""well she's not my daughter."" At this point I went from being annoyed to livid. Yes I fucked up by leaving the door open. However I think that he should have tried to stop her from running outside, or at the very least a heads up like ""she's running over to you.""

45y58z,,"My bestie (call her May) and I met when we were young (she was 16, I was 20). We've been friends ever since, staying close (pre-internet!) even when we lived far apart. For the last decade we have lived in the same town and been very close. We'd usually see each other a couple times a week, and we have a group of friends that get together at least once a month. But May has been my best friend my whole adult life.

In the past decade, we have both had ups and downs, because shit happens. She went through five years of progressively worse pain that resulted in a hysterectomy. She always wanted babies (we met and bonded when she was babysitting a mutual friend's daughter) and she was obviously crushed by knowing she'd never have her own. Through all of those years of pain and depression, I was always there for her, as a shoulder to cry on, for distraction when she wanted, or just to listen when she had to explode. Once I stayed with her for two days when her husband feared she might self-harm. In the last year, her life has come together nicely; she and her husband bought a house and a new car and they are preparing to adopt a child. I've seen a lot less of her since they bought the house but it's out in the country (I can't drive) so I expected that and haven't complained.

Meanwhile, my life has fallen apart. I was diagnosed with a chronic, disabling neurological disease, my marriage disintegrated, I can't work in my field anymore because of my diagnosis, and other life crap. Through all of it, I have relied on May; she's the only friend I've felt comfortable being totally honest with (besides my therapist), not having to wear a social mask and pretend things are better than they really are. I'm not generally a negative person; even with my life getting harder, I still look forward to every day, and I still expect that things will turn around eventually. 

Last night, May came over for a ""quick visit."" She told me that she has been coming over less because she can't "

I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.

My housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.

He knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again.

So this is ongoing and rather annoying. One of my good friends (also a redditor, hello if you’re reading this) and I are in one hell of a dispute and I need help.

Basically, he (lets call him Matt) and a girl (let’s call her Taylor) had dated a few years back, and with Taylor recently being single, they decided to hook up, no strings. I am very good friends with both and heard both sides of the story. Both sets of parents HATE the opposite child, so although they both kind of want to date seriously (Taylor more than Matt), it could never happen. Matt decides after a few weeks that he doesn’t like the risk/reward of the scenario, has been contemplating ending it for a wile and complaining about the situation, and thus decides to call it off. He calls and texts her, and they discuss it, and eventually there is a resolution made: no more hooking up between the two. Now, this is where perspectives begin to vary.

Matt says that Taylor begins at this point to spread rumors about him amongst his and her (therefore my) friends. She tells people that he pushed her into things, and that she wanted to do them but he started it all. She tells people that he promised to eventually take her out, and broke those promises. She tells people he dropped her out of nowhere with no reason. He feels she ruined his life by spreading all of these rumors.

Taylor says that she talked to her friends about the situation, and never spread any rumors maliciously or purposely. Although she was upset at the time of the breaking-off point, and probably dropped a bit more profanity than necessary, she didn’t carry it over. She says she talked to her friends about the situation, but only to figure out what to do and how to handle the situation. He is overreacting a great deal.

And of course, as per the old saying, ""there are three sides to a story: his way, her way, and the truth”, there’s what actually happened. From what I’ve gathered, Taylor probably was upset and tal"

Well roommate 1's boyfriend, BF1 and his roommate, Curly, pay rent at a house about five minutes away in a slightly sketchier part of town. Well, apparently their house has been broken into before and they would like to move.

Roommate 2 and I share a bathroom and each have separate rooms. Roommate 1's dad owns the house and knows roommate 2 and I live here.

We recently learned that the money roommate 1 receives stays with her and that her ""allowance"" so her dad doesn't have to give her any money. Okay, that's fine. *** end clarification***

We all agreed that it is okay for Curly and BF1 to move in since school ends in May and their lease isn't up until February 27th. So they'll be here for only 2ish months. Fine.

By the time we made it back to campus after my RA took a cab with us, my friends who had kept the couple separate had to go home, so I had to take more of an active role. We got him away from her and back to my room, but he was being drunk and unreasonable and kept talking about how he wanted ""to win."" He rambled on saying how fucking your RA would achieve ""diplomatic immunity"" as a dealer. I argued that such immunity would only last until they stopped fucking and the RA realizes how her job was on the line, when she would likely throw my roommate under the bus to save herself. And if the room ever got searched after this ""diplomatic immunity"" ended, I would become my roommate's cellmate. For a long time. 

Fed up with his drunk crap, I saw an opportunity to slap him and took it. I hoped it would either slap some sense into him, sober him up a bit, or make him take a step back and think about the situation from another perspective. I continued to try to reason with him but his mind was made, and I was a dick for cockblocking. 

Albeit it would be legendary to fuck your RA, am I unreasonable for expecting my roommate should wait till the last week of the semester, rather than possibly throwing away both of our lives? And AITA for trying to bring him back to earth wi"
46syyi,,"There'll be mostly only one other person (aside from OP) in the story so I think ""I"" will always be the pronoun for me, the OP and ""him"" will mostly be about this one other person.

I have a bi friend who we call Bifriend came out to me when I came out to him. This was around two years ago or so? We used to be high school buddies, then drifted away, then we got to catch up online and sort of came out to each other. We have a completely disjoint set of friends now.

Thing is, I'm the only friend he ever came out to. I live in a country where the culture is just starting to accept same sex relationships. So it's still a bit taboo in a sense. But not too taboo.

Just in case he came out to me because he's interested in me, I made it clear that I'm not.

Everything I say onwards happened online now, unless stated otherwise.

At first, it wasn't yet a burden that he'd exclusively talk to me about guys he likes. It's like 99% of our conversation topics. At first it was fine. But then it gets tiring, since he keeps on sharing of guys I don't know and tells how hot they are. During the first few days, I was fine with it. But then it got old very fast. Especially since we're basically leading different lives now and I'm pretty much disconnected with what he's doing.

I told him this and tried to suggest that he tell other friends (friends that he hangs out with personally these days). This is because (a) I'm not too interested in ogling strangers. (b) I think it's healthier to have someone you see on a personal basis to be some kind of support friend for being bi.

He holds this belief that he can be happy without coming out to any more people. And I hold this belief that it's always better to at least let your close friends know. So basically, with his principle, I remain the only friend with whom he's out to.

Today, I came to the realization that I am in some way enabling him not coming out to any more people because he can always have someone to talk to. This is because "
46x51k,,"This morning, after 2+ months of morning showers that start out on the jet setting and having to switch it back to the rain, I asked my sister why she uses the jet setting to take a shower. She said she doesn't, she uses the rain to shower but she uses jet at the end, when she turns the temperature to cold to wash her face, because she doesn't want the cold water hitting her whole body. I told her she should start switching it back to rain when she got out of the shower, just to be considerate to the people (two of us,) who use the shower after her. She said why should she, when, hypothetically, if she did use the jet for the entire shower, I never flip it back to jet when I'm done with rain for her. I said that didn't make sense. Number one, majority rules. If two of us use rain and one uses jet, rain should be the default. Number two, she'd just admitted to using the rain, so my flipping it off of jet is actually doing her the favor. She said that's not the point, and that it didn't take very much energy for me to switch it anyway. It doesn't, but it's annoying as hell to reach up and twist the shower head and have the cool water being pushed out go down your arm. I told her I hadn't said anything for awhile, but it was getting old, and I compared it to someone leaving the toilet seat up. It's fine the first few times, but when it keeps happening you're going to bring it up. She maintains that if it was me using the jet setting, I wouldn't change it back either. I maintain that that's irrelevant, because I don't use it. It's a stupid argument, I know, and we were both irritable, but it *is* annoying. AMITA for wanting her to flip it back?"

However, I am big on getting both sides of the arguments. I want to know how he's able to sway so many people and how he got to where he is today, even though I don't particularly like him.

I asked my parents if I could pay for it on Amazon and they said no because they don't want to give him money. Also, that they won't let me buy it. They're liberal themselves as well. They said that they're ""open-minded but not so open-minded that their brains fall out"", which is kinda insulting to me personally because they just low key called me unintelligent. 

I just feel like they say that they're open-minded, yet refuse to let me even read something written by somebody they don't like. I want to read Mein Kampf for the same reason. I want to understand another POV, even though I disagree with it.

470rur,,"I work as a night shift security guard alone at a construction site.

On weekends we have a day shift Guard come, who we must be relieved by and in turn relieve on rotating 12 hour shifts over weekends and holidays.

The guy that has been there for the past two months consistently shows up 15-45 minutes late and a couple times has been 2+ hours late.

And the only times he was still there when I arrived (usually 15 minutes early like you supposed to be in security), we're the first 3 shifts he worked. Every other time I get a text from him saying ""Keys in the BBQ, have to catch the bus"" and then I need to either hop, or disassemble the fence in order to enter the site because all the entrances are locked.

The times he has been on time have all been because someone from the company drove and picked him up at his house and drove him to the site. Mainly myself because I had a lot of shifts that met with his and usually didn't want to have to stick around for an extra hour.

Yesterday he said he was going to be late and I covered for him for the first hour when he was giving regular updates as to when he would arrive. And I covered for him because I figured it was an easy extra hour's pay. During these conversations he let slip that this shift was going to be his last.

After an hour 45 minutes, I stopped getting updates. I called and texted him, I walked out to the major street to see if he was coming and his phone had died, nothing. He is at most a 20-30 minute walk from the site. And we make enough money that in the past 2 months he could have bought at least a cheap bike to ride to and from work if nothing else.

At the 2 hour mark I called our Operations Manager, I informed him of the situation and he told me to stay there for another hour, if he didn't arrive the manager would be there by then to relieve me (this would be pushing a 14 hour shift).

Essentially me and a friend both had a crush on a girl. He came forwards and told me about his feelings for her, being his friend I agreed to try and wingman for him, he had no idea I liked her. We were talking every so often and I was dropping hints and trying to find out how she felt about him.

Anyway, the one fateful day at a party I was talking to her and being drunk me after failing for most of the evening to get them together asked her if she had any feelings for him or found him attractive at all. No way apparently, she figured out ages ago that he liked her but didn't want to flat out reject him.

Here's where I'm potentially the asshole, a little while later I take my chance figuring that since their situation was now clearly a no no it was ok. Things went pretty well and understandably he was pissed.

To be honest I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole here but I would like to know how much of an asshole. As said this happened years ago and I haven't spoken to either of them for at least 2 years so it doesn't matter either way. Thanks for the judgement reddit"

He smokes one after another without even noticing and does it in the places where I would go like the kitchen. I told him that it's making my throat sore and cough but he continues to do it in the kitchen. I try and stay away from him when he does it but the smoke billows through the house and I asked him to not smoke in the kitchen and to do it outside or in his room and he just ignored me when I asked at first but now he gets bitchy when I ask him and whenever I cough.
The other day I snapped and said ""I know this is your house and everything but your smoking is pissing me off because my throat is constantly sore from it and we eat and clean clothes in the kitchen. Is it that difficult to just stand at the door and smoke out there? I had to make changes and compromise when I moved in here why can't you do this one thing?""

47c4l4,,"Hoo boy, this is gonna take some explanation.

My partner (m/21) 'Allan' and I (m/27) have been in a relationship for the better part of two years now. He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).

Previously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.

We've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.

And so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.
On top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project.

I got into a bit of trouble at age 15, and my adoptive parents gave me back to my grandma and basically said ""you deal with it"".
I moved from Miss. back to Washington.
Long story short, I believe grandma has a narcissistic personality. She screamed at me because I ""did the dishes wrong"". There was only a single dishsoap bubble on a plate, and she accused me of trying to make her sick. [Edit] *She* *kicked* *me* *out* *over* *this* *shit.*
I ended up hooked on drugs at age 16, and I pulled through it all on my own. I moved to Nevada and never looked back.
In that time, I had broken contact with grandma several times. I had my daughter last April and decided every great grandma needs to know their great grand child. Im an only grand child, the daughter of an only child, in a long line of women. So this was special to me!

When I called grandma, she asked me to move in with her. ""I'll let you live here rent free if you just come here and help me do things around the house and you get a job.""

I sold my new sporty little Abarth for an 05 CR-V, packed up, and didnt think twice.
In two days, I landed a little job selling pot legally. I make $10 an hour and work 8 (ish) hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and I LOVE it.
But I stand all day. So I'm ready to relax when I get home... Kick my shoes off..

Well, grandma has cleaned up her drug habit. But now she has a new one.

Methadone.

She sells them. She abuses them. She stays up all hours of the night pacing, stomping, cleaning, cussing herself out, yelling at the cats. And I'm like.. Dude.. I have work at 9 am? And I just want a moment to kick my feet up...

So a week passes by, and I'm losing my patience. But I keep quiet. Really quiet. Too quiet for grandma.
She would ask ""whats wrong?"" and then chew me out for telling her ""I just dont like the way you talk to me. I just wanna have a norma"
47eqxj,,"So for some background, I'm a college student from the US who's 19, turning 20 a week from Sunday.  I have your stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother, and I love her, but I think what she did recently is a little out of line but I might just be thinking like a spoiled bitch.

A few months back, I made plans to go to Trinidad with some friends for spring break.  I had the money for the hotel, food, spending, etc. but had a little trouble coming up with the money for the flight when it came time.  I mentioned to my mother that I needed to work a little more to save up the money (I have a pretty well paying and flexible job) and she asks how much, then says she'll just buy me the tickets as a 20th birthday present as the family business is doing well and I've been doing pretty well at school lately.  I said she didn't have to, she insisted, and I was honestly pretty stoked about saving $400.  

Fast forward to a few days ago, and once again I'm planning a trip.  A friend from high school and I want to visit his family in Germany for a week in the summer.  I call up my mom to tell her I just bought flight tickets to Berlin in June, and she's furious with me.  I want to pull the ""I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions"" card, but I know that won't go over well, so I instead ask why she has such a big issue with it.  

She tells me she doesn't think it's safe for my friend and I to travel to Germany just the two of us, because it's so far away, Berlin is a big city and cities have crime, because I'd be ""closer to ISIS"" (what??), and she's not sure if she can ""trust my friend"".  I respond with ""so you're worried about me going to an extremely safe country I'm familiar with, with someone you know well, who I've known for five years.  But you're totally okay with me going to an unfamiliar country with a high crime rate with people you've never met, who I've known for three months?""  She immediately says ""Well now that you put it that way, maybe I'm not okay with it!""."

I should probably clear something up. Before this happened, my parents had a dog and two cats. I did grow up with animals so I had some experience. Also, we only found 5 of her 12 cats. That following Sunday she bought a new trailer a couple of blocks away from her old one. My dad and I went over there before she did and we tour out the carpet. We agreed to never tell her there was ever a carpet there. She had to stay an extra week to get the heating built in, but I had to leave that Tuesday because classes were starting. 

I came back to my parent's house last night for the weekend, my parents did a terrific job cleaning up the aftermath of that experience. They also decided to keep one of her cats. 

My grandmother is at her new place now. The cats are housebroken. I think they were housebroken before because it only took a couple days to get them to use the litter box. Though I was never able to housebreak the dogs because my grandmother would keep letting them out of their crates. Though now she is paying someone to walk her dogs daily and she agreed to get a house cleaner to come in three times a week. It was the best my dad could do, but that woman is stubborn. So everything is back to normal. "
47yygk,,"I am currently in this group project with a couple of people and today, we were deciding on who is going to get how much credit for their work. This is when things start to get heated. 

While we all agreed that the team leader and his brother should get the most and least amount of credit respectively for the project thus far, we are having a disagreement on the amount of credit for my work in the project and this other guy's credit (Let's call him Francis). From the very beginning, Francis latched onto the team out of nowhere when we were assigned into a group for our class but we decided to be nice and let him stay on our team. Soon after, we saw that he was incompetent in writing and didn't have the skills that we need for the project but we still decided to give him the benefits of the doubt, seeing how it was only at the beginning and he might need some time to improve. However, as time went on, we saw that he repeatedly slacked off whenever we meetup to work on our project. We all knew this but nobody wanted to tell him that he's been burdening us with ""babysitting"" him and making sure that he does his portion of the project.

And so today, after seeing how he was on his phone again and not paying attention while we were racking our brains on this hard assignment, I decided that it was the last straw for me and called him out on it. I listed out all the things that he has been doing such as the lack of focus, the lack of quality contributions and so on (all of which we know are true). But of course, he felt shocked and was genuinely surprised by why am I ""low-balling"" his contributions when in fact, us remaining three made up of most of the contribution in the team. Apparently, I upset and offended him for telling him something that were all on our minds, even though we should have told him from the very beginning. 

To his credits, he did contribute a tiny amount of effort to the team since the team leader has assigned him a couple of tasks that he completed"

2fkgww,,"So a bit of backstory in May of this year I was involved in a wreck where I was hit by a drunk driver and then she hauled ass off in her truck and hit a light pole about a mile down the road and was arrested. 


So since then I have had to go to physical therapy for several months out of my pocket until I can get reimbursed (I've spent almost $1000 just on that and Dr visits and I only make $8.12/hr) anyways I always took solace in the fact that she was in jail for what she did I looked up her arrest record to find out that less than a year ago she had received another sui charge and had her liscense suspended. 


So after dealing with the insurance company for about 2 months I decided that I should get a lawyer come to find out that she got charged with dui, driving with a suspended license and failure to yield. She was found not guilty of everything but the failure to yield so I'm fucking pissed about that already. 


Now here's where the new thing happened I checked my email this morning and saw I got an email from my lawyer and it read 


"" Good morning vapormaker843:  I received a call this morning from Progressive advising that this claim was not reported to them until they received my letter.  They are asking for an explanation as to why the claim was not reported at the time of the accident.  Can you please update me in this regard?  Thank you for your continued cooperation and I will anticipate your expeditious response."" 


Now please know neither me not the drunk idiot have progressive as put insurance provider. 


So why is my lawyer sending out personal information about me to a company that has nothing to do with them. And more importantly they are taking 33% or whatever I win so I'm paying them a third of my money and they can't even send the paperwork to the right insurance company.

We all had 4 people to each room, but the rooms only had two beds.   
  
Two guys were sleeping in each bed.  They were pretty big and we weren't gigantic dudes, so not a problem.  The other two guys and myself were fine with it, but the guy who was going to be sharing a bed with me said he didn't feel comfortable sharing a bed with anyone.  
  
I basically told him that I wasn't going to sleep on the floor for a night just because he has a minor problem and that I was sleeping in the bed and he could sleep wherever.  So he slept on the floor all three nights(with blankets and pillows of course, but still a disney hotel room floor).

I tell him no, basically said that's not my responsibility and I shouldn't have to do this to get my money back. (Keep in mind he's being fairly vague until now. It took about 3 texts for me to understand one thing he was sayin.) He then tells me he'll give me $8 to pay back the griptape guy.

2fnf78,,"Heya reddit :) I know it's sort of an out-there question, so I definitely need to give you guys some background so that this makes more sense. I have been working as an escort for about 16 months now. As a college student, it is a wonderful source of income because I make insane money per hour and so only need to work a tenth - maybe even a twentieth of what other college students are working to finance themselves. This was all well and good until about 12 months ago when I met my boyfriend. At the beginning we just met through mutual friends and enjoyed hanging out. Pretty shortly after, we ended up hooking up and right after I immediately came out to him as a sex-worker. When I told him this, he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact, he seems really interested in it, asking a lot of insightful questions and also remarking that he was pretty turned on that he was getting what other people payed so much for.  He also remarked that he didn't think it was too big of a deal because he usually only dated in an 'open-relationship' paradigm where sex with others is not cheating. This is the kind of relationship I like also.

Needless to say I was totally thrilled by this because to be honest I thought that I would be single for as long as I escorted. I couldn't imagine someone being comfortable enough with it that they could date me. I was also really into him, so obviously this response of his propelled us into a relationship, which over time has become very serious and intimate. We now live together and for the most part are very happy together. 

Here's the tricky part. For awhile, his words rang true. I was always honest with him about when I was working and at what hotel in the city (He insisted on knowing for safety reasons) and he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact he would occasionally drive me or pick me up afterwards and we would talk about our day/how it went with no awkwardness or tension at all. However, in the last 4 months or so I have noticed his attitude c"
2fntbb,,"Throwaway account here.  
  
Here is some backstory: I've been with my partner for 2.5 years. Last year, his sister got married in a small ceremony at their parents' house. She and her partner were planning to travel abroad for both work and honeymooning, so they wanted a marriage license to cut down on nonsense if something happened while they were out of the country. It was a small, lovely ceremony with family and basically-family only. They had plans to have a larger party later on for all their friends back home.  
  
Fast forward to this year. I'm now in graduate school and my partner and I only get to see each other on weekends. This sucks mightily and I really treasure the time we have together now. I get really, really annoyed when anything interferes with our time together. This weekend is the sister's second wedding. And when I say second wedding, I mean it's another ceremony with the same person she's still married to, but this time with the family AND 200+ guests AND a huge amount of pomp and circumstance that I've heard my ""in-laws"" planning. The sister's family is all going, including the extended family, and of course, my partner, all of whom were there the first time. I'm not attending, as it's a 6+ hour drive for me and graduate school waits for no one. And, you know, I was there the first time when they actually got married.
  
So, here is my question: Am I the asshole for thinking this is a hugely selfish thing to do on the part of the sister? God bless her if she wants to have a huge party with her friends at home who didn't get to go to the first ceremony. But making all of her family up and mobilize to watch her get married...again? Why not do it right the first time? If this were the only ceremony, I'd totally understand and would even try my darndest to attend, but now I just miss my sweetie and think this whole thing is a huge indulgence and a waste of time."
2fo3p5,,"Perspective:

-I'm still in high school

-She won't allow me to get a job (she says I should do extracurriculars instead) (edit: which I do plenty of)

-Ever since I had to spend it she said she would pay me back

-It was on toilet paper, food, school stuff, etc.

-I spent it in July and it is now September

I wouldn't care that much but it was all my birthday money, and I need a new wallet, so I was going to use it to splurge on a nice one. Now I only have $20 in my cash stash. I feel like an asshole asking for it but I don't know what else to do. 

EDIT: The thing here is that she said she would pay me back. I remember her words being ""Could you go shopping? Would you mind using your cash? I'll pay you back later."" I had to spend it on groceries because she was on a trip and wasn't going to be home in time to go shopping. Later just never came.

2frddy,,"Here's some backstory: 

A couple months back I bought an XBOX 360 controller since our other ones are kind of crappy. I bought it for $30. The controller worked fine, however, I instructed my brothers that under no circumstances are they to use this without my permission (because they are known to leave things around/break them).

Lo and behold, I find one using the controller without my consent. Because I wasn't particularly pissy that day, I told him he could continue to use it ***in the event he puts it back unharmed.*** He doesn't put it back, but instead puts it in a precarious spot where it can fall. I tell him to move it, but he refuses.

Later on, he ends up dropping and breaking the controller (he technically broke the mechanism that connects the right trigger to the circuit, which renders RT unusable. Therefore, the whole thing is useless because RT is so universaly used). I inform him of this, and tell him he can get me a new controller or reimburse me for my purchase. While normally I wouldn't care, this particular controller was the only one that worked with the computer, so I cannot play games that require a controller now (emulators).

----

Fast forward to now: my brother announces that he is planning to buy a new hunting game (with what funds, I don't know, since he doesn't have a job and has been known to take money). I tell him that he must get me a new controller before proceeding with the purchase. He at first dodges it, claiming the controller isn't mine, then that he didn't brake it (even though I have a witness), followed by his flat-out refusal to purchase it. 

Now I am planning to take his new game and withhold it from him until he reimburses me for the controller he broke. I have given him multiple warnings, and he had ignored all of them. Does that make me an asshole? 

P.S. I have more than enough money to purchase a new controller. This is more about his refusal to repay me and his ignorance than it is my care for a new controller.

2fsaf7,,"I started working at a convenience store on Friday night. Its a nice, higher end convenience store, but isn't nationwide. I don't want to name names for obvious reasons. I got hired on the overnight shift. I was kind of weary about this even in my interview. I am a full time student in university right now, so even though she told me I would be doing overnights on weekends (mostly Friday night and Saturday night), I wasn't sure if I could handle it. 

The job isn't particularly bad, its just not something I really want to go to every weekend between 10 PM and 6 AM, and not something I want to fuck up my sleep schedule to do either. I'm already feeling the effects of this, as I slept between the hours of 7 AM and 11 AM this morning (or... yesterday), but now at 1 AM, I can't fall asleep.

I also just don't really like the job. Its overnights at a 24/hr convenience store, not particularly exciting. I like the people who work there, and they seem to like me, but its a lot of the shit work that I'm not keen on doing. 

I'm still actively looking for jobs. I've only worked three days and I've already decided I kind of hate it. Am I the Asshole because as soon as I find a new, different, better job, I plan on putting in a two weeks and getting the fuck out of there?"
2ft7yg,,"Last night, my girlfriend  and I got back from an evening at the beach. We went to my house for a little bit just to spend some time together (she texted her mom to let her know that she was safe). We watched a TV show here and there and then spent the next few hours just talking to each other, kissing and cuddling. Without us realizing, it got a little late and we grew tired. She asked if she could take a quick nap which I said was no problem. However, I ended up falling asleep as well and when I came to, it was 2:00 in the morning. I realized that I was way too tired to safely drive her home and we ended up spending the night together and didn’t wake up until 7:00 this morning. My parents were already asleep by this time and I didn’t want to wake them and I hoped that they’d be understanding. 

A few minutes after we were both awake, I made her breakfast and then drove her home. My mom was more understanding than her partner who said what I did was horrible and an asshole thing to do. My mom of course still wasn’t exactly pleased but she was happy to know that we didn’t have sex or anything (which I wouldn’t have done anyways because we’re not at that point yet.) Did I do the right thing last night or am I, like my mom’s partner says, an asshole?

Additional Information: 

My girlfriend and I are both close to 19 (she turns 19 next week and I turn 19 in three months)

We have been together for a little over a month

My mom’s partner and I have been at each other’s throats for 8 of the 13 years that she and my mom have been together. Which is why I’m asking this on here because I know I might be a little biased when it comes to what she says. 


Edit: Feel free to ask any further questions about the situation and I Will answer 100% honestly.

In a nutshell, my fiancé has this thing where she gets really high and eats until she can't do anything but pass out. I smoke pot myself, but I don't have the same habits as she does. She will literally eat dinner, a bag of chips, two Popsicles and then eat goldfish out of the bag until she falls asleep. I don't really find her actions as attractive but I love her either way, but if the moment apparently sparks she will always stop and say that she doesn't want to because she is too full. I know this is really weird but it's been about 4 months since we have made love and sometimes I feel like she is not attracted to me anymore.

2fyaw2,,"I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, I'm on my phone.

Me and my drum major don't always get along. At practice today, she was saying ""oh you have no friends"" and stuff like that which I don't take personally because I know she's kinda joking around. In return I said something like ""you're just bitter because you liked me and I turned you down"" and she got a bit defensive. Later on at practice, the fellow band member that was standing next to the drum major flicked me off and I asked ""what was that for?"" And she said that was from the drum major and the drum major said something like ""oh yea that was from me, I had her flick me off for me"" and then I said ""well why can't you do it yourself huh?"" And then I can't remember exactly what I said after that, hut I was insulting her conducting skills. It might've been something like ""oh because you can't even conduct by yourself?"" Or something along those lines. She got REALLY defensive and told me to put my horn down and run a lap because I was talking back to her. I refused, and it escalated a bit. She told that I have to ""run off my bad attitude"" and until I ""realize who's in charge"" I'm going to never be anything. I just refused to run and she eventually just told me to stand back in line. I find this to be an abuse of her power, and that I should tell the band director about this. Looking back after typing this, it does seem very juvenile and pathetic, but this really made me steamed.

Am I in the wrong here?"
2g0lkt,,"This morning, I was stopped at the ""T"" [right here](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0493477,-118.4480272,88m/data=!3m1!1e3), waiting for the traffic to clear up so I could turn right on Ohio. 

There were a LOT of cars, as there always are in the morning, heading towards Sepulveda, so you kind of have to wait a long time for someone to actually slow down and let you in. 

Or you have to wait for the light at Sepulveda to turn red and for traffic to pile up at it and work its way back to you before someone ""keeps clear"" and provides a gap you can go into once the light turns green and people start to take off again.

Anyway, this older dude behind me in a sedan starts honking and flipping me off, telling me to ""go! go! go!""... I motioned to him that there was still oncoming traffic, and that I would be cutting them off if I went, but he continued to honk and flip me off.

I told him to calm down, at which point he flew off the handle and started flipping me off even harder and yelling at the top of his lungs. I just patiently waited for a sufficient gap to appear. 

When I did enter Ohio, he followed close behind, still honking and flipping me off. I was going to turn left on Sepulveda, so when I got into the turning lane, he pulls up beside me on my right and goes, ""FUCK YOU!! SUCK MY DICK! MOTHERFUCKER!!"" whilst flipping me off. He then proceeded to turn right, going south on Sepulveda. 

I figured he probably could have saved himself some headaches if he had just turned on Massachusetts instead.

So someone made a comment about how Destiny wasn't on PC, in a very rude way. I was annoyed by the comment, so asked if he could treat other users with a bit more respect, because all consoles have their exclusives, whether it be WiiU, 3DS, PS4, Xbox, or PC, and that you shouldn't boast about your own, especially because it's entirely an opinion whether or not a game is good. 

  Someone asked me if I was really offended, and I explained that I was annoyed, and why it was a big deal. I explained that this type of comment is toxic, and that it causes a cycle of people making two wrongs, in hope of making a right. I explained how that turns into a cycle of people being jerks to one another, and people feeling bad. I made sure to say that this is a bad thing no matter *who* it is coming from. From a PC user, Xbox, PS4, WiiU, Vita, 3DS, it doesn't matter, it's still bad. I tried as hard as I could to not take a side, and just try to strive for people not being jerks to each other, yet I was still downvoted.

Frank: Seriously guys, I know that I joke about being racist, but I'm really not. But, in my personal experience, every single black girl I've ever met has been really fucking rude and annoying.

Me: ...No, that's definitely racist.

Tina: There's no way that's racist, I can totally understand why she'd feel that way!

2h2jy7,,"My friend and I were playing some online game together. I was with another friend in the game lobby waiting to queue up for matchmaking. The friend in question, lets call him B, joined our chatroom and wanted to tag along. I invited him and he joined our lobby. The only thing he needs to do now, is selecting something and then we would have aprox 10 min time till the game starts. He tells us that he was watching a stream and wanted to wait till it was over. So instead of wasting 1 second to start a process that would take a lot longer than his stream, he made us wait another 5 minutes. When he told us his stream was over,
 I said to him:"" Can you pick now ?""

B:""yes,yes. Why are you so pissed again ?""

Me:""you just had to lock and we could have queued up !""

B:""Stop bugging me!""

Me: ""We just waited 5 minutes for you. The world doesnt evolve around you, you know !""

B: ""you can go f**k yourself, play alone! ""

He leaves the chatroom.

I know this guy for years and although we are just ""online friends"" i have met him severall times. We play together all the time and I know him for being really relaxed and slow, while I am doing things in a rush. I was used to waiting and even tolerated his ""afk really quick"" just before a game that turned out to be a 30 minute break. But recently this behaviour of his went out of hand as he was getting passiv-aggressive every time I was asking him If he was ready.

So Reddit, was I being an asshole for reacting aggressive towards his usual behaviour ?

2hv6pe,,"So I order a computer case fulfilled through an amazon seller at about 1pm on a thursday.  Base shipping was around $11, ""Expedited"" is $20.  I want it by the weekend so I grab the ""Expedited"" option. 

On saturday, I decide to track the package and there still isn't tracking info up.  I send them a friendly email to the extent of ""hey, could you update the tracking info?""  They do, and it turns out that it was shipped FedEx ground.  When I send them an email asking ""What gives, I paid for expedited,"" they didn't sent me anything back.

Finally, about a week after I get the package (7 days after they ship it), I post a review that reflects my displeasure.  Yesterday, they get back to me that if I remove the review, they will refund the excess money I paid for expedited shipping.  

I say I will as long as they tell me what the alternate method for non-expedited shipping is.  They just got back to me and told me that it's ground.  They literally charged me $10 for nothing, their reasoning is that ""it would have taken two weeks otherwise,"" meaning it would have taken them seven days to actually put it in the mail.  

Now, $10 isn't a lot of money, that's why i spent it on something as trivial as getting a package a few days earlier, but from where I'm sitting, it looks like they are scamming people double for shipping and pocketing pure profit and that just doesn't sit right with me.

I happen to be a very independent person, and choose not to ask for help often because I feel like I can accomplish something myself. My roommate is not the same way.

For example, he physically came to my door and asked me to show him where to find the defragment option on a PC that would have taken 3 seconds to look up. this happens I would say 2-3 times per day. I would also like to point out, as it may be relevant to my thought process on helping him, that he enjoys annoying me through his stupid actions everytime he goes to the kitchen and makes me get up out of bed to answer and put up with that.

About a month ago, he found out he had a project to do that involved filming stills and his particular scene involved having lions in it. He made an off comment about how I *could* put lions in a picture with photoshop, and I said, that I probably could. Fast forward to tonight, and he comes up and says that he is taking the pictures now, and will need the photoshopped results tonight. At this point, I had both not realized that that offhanded comment was my agreeing to this, and that it had to be done tonight. I am thinking to myself that he could figure it out as it is his project, and he waited until the last minute to do it, and I say that I think that he should work on his own homework as this photoshop would easily be a few hours, over 50% of the project, and I have my own homework to do. I did focus on how he shouldn't rely on me for helping with everything because at this point I was annoyed with having to do so.

2xv6te,,"My mother recently revealed to my sister and I that she has no retirement money put aside.  At 73(?) years old, she's taken ill with a chronic respiratory condition that requires her to be on oxygen all the time.  She needs assistance with some tasks, but (by her doctor's advisement) is capable of accomplishing most tasks independently.  For now.

More background:  my mother is a certified narcissist. She only cares about herself, and everyone else she considers her ""loved ones"" are there to support her and give her life structure and connection. She has always wanted only to be taken care of by the people around her.  

As far as her health, my mother ignores doctor's advice, and cancels appointments at whim. We encourage her to be independent and active (key aspects of living successfully at any age, but particularly at her age), but she is argumentative, and refuses to do anything to help herself.  We offer support (logistically) when we can, but it's extremely frustrating to deal with her, for these reasons and more.

She was abusive (physically and emotionally) to my sister and I our whole childhood and mentally/emotionally cruel on through young adulthood and beyond.  She was unable to help us at any stage of our life, and worse, she was a detriment to our lives for the most part.  She is a horrible person who just assumed someone would step up to take her in.  Our relationship is, at best, strained.  My mother and father separated when we were young, and she never remarried.  She has pushed away her family, and lives too far for them to be of help, even if they wanted to.  She has had money, but largely squandered it away through various bad decisions.  

My sister and I live alone, and live outside the city she lives in.  We don't have the means to be the caretaker for her--even if we wanted to, which we don't.  I feel guilty about it all the time, because I think most people SHOULD help their parents out if they can.  The fact that she has no retirement mon"

During the month or so she is gone I end up reconnecting with my ex girlfriend right before this other chick comes back and end up getting her pregnant.  She lives the next city over but I am there for her emotionally and tell her I will support her 100% with any decision she ends up making because I love her.

I pick up the other girl when she gets back in town with a huge chip on my shoulder.  We end up having the most impersonal sex of my life and after its over I just pass out with my back to her.  Basically just screaming i dont like you with my body language.  The week goes by and over the weekend she starts to ask questions why I don't call her anymore, act so distant etc but with a very angry tone.  She ends the conversation with a ""should we just never talk again?"" angry message and I just say yeah thats probably for the best.  Since its the weekend I make the drive back up to where my ex lives in the next city over.  We have a long talk, admit our love for each other, and decide to get back together.

Colleague B recently left the company and moved in with her fiancée in a different country. She never really liked her job here and she's pretty much persuing her dream abroad, so it's unlikely that she'll come back.

2xyle6,,"Howdy all. I live in a fairly small city/town in central Oklahoma.

Every time you go in the damn library, there's hobos outside wanting this or that or the other. They sit outside and smoke all day, and leave their cigarette butts everywhere. They harass people going into the library. They stink up the place (literally, they smell fucking horrible). They're rude.

Just the other day, a homeless guy in a wheelchair was sitting in front of the door. I offered to help him in, and he accepted. After I wheeled him across the threshold, the smell hit me-- old cat urine, cheap tobacco smoke, and rancid food. Just imagine being waterboarded with a bucket of Chinese food mixed with cat urine (from concentrate) that had been sitting out in the Texas summer for two weeks, mixed with the juices from a roadkilled rabid raccoon that had eaten nothing but skunk. Imagine the slimy brown juice sliding inexorably into your nostrils, dripping down into the back of your mouth, the hot-sweat-and-metal tang of the rusty bucket... that's how bad this dude smelled.

Anyway, I went into the main part of the library and he stayed in the foyer... and after a few minutes, you could smell this guy in the library itself. He never went in, either. He just sat there staring at everyone as they went in and out.

Quite frankly, there's no excuse for that. The tribes have quite a few social programs and there are two homeless shelters nearby. The only requirement f"
2xzh55,,"My girlfriend has a hole in her heart and has to go into the hospital like twice a week, usually from about 10 pm to 4 am. If we're fighting about something at this time, she'll tell me she can't deal with us right now and that I'm stressing her out. Whenever she has to go into the hospital I feel obligated to stay up with her but honestly I'm missing copious amounts of sleep. Am I the asshole for just wanting to go to bed when she has to go to the hospital? Or for not viewing her heart failure as a valid excuse to get out of arguments? If you need any more details I'd be glad to elaborate.
Thanks!"
2yc7e5,,"Essentially I asked her how many people she has slept with and done anything with. (we are both young) She lied to me twice, first saying she slept with one, then two, then five which I presume is the truth. Then she said she's done things with 6, then 8, 7, then 10, essentially she just won't give me a straight answer about it. This is more of a trust issue than anything at this point and I got mad she was being evasive and said ""Fine, I don't even want to know if you were a slut in your past"" and now shes PISSED at me. So amitheasshole for saying that, or even asking? Or is she for not being truthful about it? She says shes ashamed of it and regrets all of it so maybe thats why shes evasive but... i still wanted to know. Are we both assholes? Thanks"

Nearby I see a woman quiclky hide hers in her own bag so she doesn't have to give it up. She's not legally obligated to after all so she has the right to do this. I ask her for it and she pretends like she doesn't have one so I make a move to steal it. In the struggle I am forced to break her arm to take it from her and use it to save my mothers life.

2yjcbz,,"So I go to college at a decently-respected art school in the Midwest and last semester I took a writing class in which the professor quite seemed to enjoy my work.

One day near the end of the semester, I spoke with her after class, asking her if she had time to talk at more length about my work and things that could be improved, and she said she did and had a conversation with me about it. She brought up a well-known paper in the area and asked if I had ever considered writing for them, saying that she knew someone there and would be happy to connect me.

Before the semester ended, I emailed her politely inquiring about a possible positive entry in my file as well as the internship, which she had told me to ask the school about (there was no fellowship or credit for it at my school, it would be completely separate). She never responded.

After the new semester started, I once again emailed her about the internship, and she once again neglected to respond. 

This was beginning to upset me after two weeks or so of no response, so I asked another student who I knew was taking her class to email her and ask about it, and she neglected to respond to him. The other student told me he would ask her about it after class when he took it but this didn't really sit well with me. Luckily, my class that day got out early so I went to try and talk to this professor after her class let out.

Once my friend had left, the professor started saying that my emails had made her feel harassed and trapped. She was confused as to what I wanted. About my request for a positive note in my file: ""I only give letters of recommendation for people seeking to enter grad programs"" (I am a first year student). 

She accused me of wanting her to introduce me to her connection with the internship and get my foot in the door, which I did admittedly want, but when I was emailing her I was only asking general questions about the internship itself and what I would have to do to get it. She said that she"
2ykevm,,"One of the few things my wife and I fight about is cleaning. We both work full time - she is an hourly retail employee and I have a typical 8-6 office job. Last year, my office closed and I started working from home for the main corporate office in New York. Still the same work day, just a different desk.

Anyway, long story short, my wife hates cleaning. Absolutely detests it. She says she's too tired after work to help clean, and gets furious if I expect her to help clean on her days off, because that's ""her only time to relax."" However, I am expected to spend my weekends cleaning, shopping, and running errands, and I get angry comments if dishes are unwashed or carpets unvacuumed when she gets home. If she does clean anything, she makes a big production out of how she's going out of her way to help, and that I never appreciate what she does around the house.

Her reasoning is that, because her job is physical and mine is mental, I should be able to clean while I work, or that I should hop out of my office right at 5pm to scrub the counters. I'd like a little time to unwind too, but because I'm not on my feet all day, she makes it sound like I don't deserve that.

I should point out that even when the roles were reversed - I was working 10 hour restaurant shifts and she was unemployed - I was still expected to clean on days off, because she was too busy looking for a job. If I don't wash the dishes one week, they just don't get done. I understand that retail work is a bit more physically demanding than the mental stresses of an office drone, but I feel like she's just making excuses to get out of doing the work.

tl;dr: I work from home, and my wife thinks live-in-maid is my second job title. Am I the Asshole?"
2ymm96,,"My girlfriend has somewhat of a short attention span. Whether we're at home sitting on the couch or eating dinner together at a restaurant or just generally talking to one another, sometimes I'll start to talk and I notice that she isn't actually paying attention. Here are some of the signs:

1. She's facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she's looking at, all the while saying, ""mhmm, yeah... uh huh""
2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. ""OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.""
3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.

And the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.

Now I'm not an attention whore by any means. I've learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn't even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I've gotten used to it by now, so I'll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I'll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, ""Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don't.""
Or I'll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like ""Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it's not even important. How was your day?""

And now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She"

I understand family.... but ugh. Both of the dogs are Australian Shepherds and (I was told from a friend who dog sat before) one of them is apparently scared and just peed/shit all in the room it was in when it was last watched because it was scared and didn't want anything to do with the sitter.

2yue3v,,"Was hanging with my girlfriend of 2 years today and her 2 friends when white people got brought up (I am white, gf is Filipino, friend 1 is white and friend 2 is asian.) Friend 1 was saying how much she hated white people and all of the stereotypes that come with it while gf and friend 2 are agreeing. I do the whole ""Wow, you guys are so racist, not all of us are like that"" and things are getting louder as they are (jokingly but with conviction) that we all are and I feel a hand slap across my face and look up to see my girlfriend looking at me with a slightly remorseful face and her hand coming back to her side. I'm thouroughly pissed that she did that and immediately left with them yelling behind me still about white people. I text her later that night saying something like ""yeah ya know i hate all filipinos too. they are FOBs and just eat dogs."" still playing along with the racism. Now I didn't actually feel this way but wanted to show her how it felt. Convo continued like this when she says you can't be racist againt white people. 

Now I'm pissed about this and her hitting me so i say ""wow babe, your usually smart but that sentence just dropped your IQ by 25 points"". She restates her sentence and convo goes on without more insults.

The next day after we stopped texting I meet up with her and she says she is very offended with what I said and dumps me. I just really don't say much as I don't think she is that serious but she walks away and texts me about how hurt she is. I later did find out that it was her friend that grabbed her hand and hit me with it but at the time I was pissed and acted impulsively. Am I the asshole for getting that mean with her or is she overreacting?

EDIT: to add, this isnt the first time that weve insulted eachother. she has said to me (of course jokingly) to fuck off, I fucking hate you, you fucking ass and etc. ive said my fair share back so its not like I broke any previous insult boundaries either."

2yzfxg,,"So I was dating this girl for around six months. For Christmas this girl gave me a painting of Batman that took her two months to paint. Fast forward to January, and we broke up because she needed time to be alone and not in a relationship. After we broke up, I defended her to my friends saying that it was mutual and she only needed time to herself. I got into arguments with my friends because I trusted her... Them the other night, I found out (from her sister) that she had cheated on me and really only broken up with me so she could get with her ex. I was furious and messaged her asking if it was true. Her response? ""I don't owe you any explanation. It's none of your damned business."" Well, it was my damn business considering it was me she cheated on. We started arguing and she personal attacks on me, attacking my anxiety, asthma, and clinical depression. So I got pissed... Really pissed, and when she asked for her painting back, I went outside and filmed me throwing in in the dumpster. She said that act had made me the biggest asshole in the world, even though she was the one who cheated on me, lied to me, and used me. So Reddit, am I the asshole or did the bitch deserve it?"
2z0lfh,,"So my brother (19 years old) decided at 15 that he would be an atheist, pretty much everyone took this as typical teenage rebellion but he stuck to it. My family is majorly christian, both parents were raised that way; but only my father has stuck to it after experiencing a crisis of faith similar to my brother's (mother is christian but never attends church and will never be found practicing her faith). I'mat the age of 16, which is the time of confirmation (For ""by the sacrament of Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed."", http://goo.gl/AuqwBT, http://goo.gl/dLYemt) if you didn't read any of that, it's basically a second baptism with the baptized promising (once again) that they will remain a servant of the church/God. I've been having trouble with my faith/depression for about 5 years now (Is god real? If not, what's the point of living out life if our actions will never have ultimate ramifications and if these actions are forgotten, do our lives really matter?). I've expressed some of these doubts with my father, but has just told me to partake in this for him. Anyways, to the actual AITA question. A few of my relatives flew into to see this. So in the morning today (confirmation day) my dad woke me up and told me to get dressed. I asked him if it was alright for someone struggling in their faith to take part in a binding nonessential sacrament (I had no intent whatsoever of leaving at this point, we had engaged in discussions of this kind many times and I merely like to talked to him). He called me selfish when I asked this, saying my relatives had flown all the way out to be with me and I was denying them what they had come to support me in.

2z3jmp,,"I was with my older dad at the mall today in a Barnes and Noble. We come to a table full of vinyl records. He's surprised and asks, ""Do people still buy these?"" I respond affirmatively, ""Hipsters still buy them."" He asks me what a hipster is and I explain, ""A hipster is someone who prefers to use obsolete technology for aesthetic reasons."" While I'm explaining, someone must have walked up to the table when I hadn't noticed. My dad proceeds to ask them if they are a hipster. The guy just looks at me rather annoyed and responds, ""No, actually my dad just got me a turntable, but thanks a lot, asshole."" He said the last part under his breath, my dad didn't notice. He proceeded to ask the stranger about the differences between records, and digital media. I suspect he must have thought I was making fun of him in some way. My dad is fairly out of touch with the culture surrounding the expression. It never occurred to him that it may not be a good idea to ask. I feel kinda bad because I didn't mean to make fun of them. At the same time, I don't think it was wrong of me to neglect to mention why you shouldn't just ask someone if they're a hipster. I really wasn't expecting him to use it in conversation, especially not someone neither of us have ever met. "

The phone was listed as a Samsung in excellent condition, and while it was a bit cheaper than the others I had found, it was not so cheap as to send up a red flag.  Within ten minutes of using this thing I figured out that something was not right. All of this leads me to believe the seller knew full well that it wasn't genuine.

The site allowed me to report this, and I'll be able to ship the phone back to the seller and get my money back.

2zlbmi,,"I had met with a recruiter last week for an initial interview. We had arranged to have the interview after I was done with work because I'm currently a contractor and don't get paid for time off. The initial interview went well. As a result, the recruiter set up a phone interview between myself and the client on Monday afternoon.

By noon on Monday, the client cancelled the interview, stating that they had an ""emergency"". Apparently, the manager of this small business does a lot of the work himself. The recruiter said that the client would reschedule the interview for Tuesday or Wednesday.

Late Tuesday afternoon, I get an email from the recruiter saying that it would be another couple of days before he could get a rescheduled time from the client. By late Wednesday evening, after I had not heard anything from the recruiter, I emailed the recruiter stating that I was no longer interested in the position. The recruiter is now wondering why I'm wanting to bail on the position. After explaining my reasons, he still pushed for the interview, stating that he'd have an answer from his client by end of business today. I'm not very hopeful. Am I the asshole for wanting to not take the interview?

Update (4-3-2015): It's been nearly three weeks since the date of what the phone interview was supposed to be (3-16-2015). The last word from the client is that they are determining whether or not they can afford to hire someone else on. I confirmed with my recruiter that nothing was ever said to the client concerning my desire to pull my application.

Final Update (4-9-2015): The client has officially decided that they could not afford to hire anyone and pulled the job from the market."
2zvgvl,,"Often, my brother and I find works of fiction that we enjoy, and want the other to read. We enjoy talking to each other a lot, so we want the other to watch/read/play stuff so we can talk about it.

The problem is that my brother is incredibly flakey about trying things that I want him to try, even though he'll still find new things to try on his own.

A few years back, I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and loved it. And I knew he would love it to. So I asked him to read it. He said he would later when he felt like it. At that time, the situation I just described wasn't really in place, so I didn't think much of it. Still, it was often at the back of my head that he still hadn't.

A few months ago *at least* two years later, he decided to read it. And it was only because he decided to use it for a school project. Excuse me if I think that gives him a bit of a poor record.

Right now, I can think of 11 things I want him to do. And I am certain there are more. I'd like it if he could finish the Hitchhiker's Guide series (since he only read the first 1 or 2), play 5 videogames (though I think I lost one, so maybe 4), read 4 webcomics, and watch 1 short webseries. He has done none of those things. Some have been things I wanted him to do for years, while some are more recent.

In the last few years, despite the fact that there have been many things I've asked him to do, he has still started a bunch of things on his own. Scratch that, he's gone actively looking for them. Yet, every single thing I want him to do, he says he'll get to ""sometime, when he feels like it."" I'm pretty sure that's going to be never.

Recently, I did get him to play a videogame. And he *really, really* like it. It was Fire Emblem: Awakening. But of course, he had to take a good thing and turn it into a bad thing. It started with one playthrough. Then it turned into one, but with frequent delays where he started the game again to test things out and do them differently. Now it's "

While he already ordered the part, he thinks that I should bring it somewhere and have someone else do the labor.  While I'm not opposed to this, he wants me to pay for the labor.  His girlfriend has expressed similar views.  It's worth noting that I had no problems with the screen before he shot it, and that we are 4th year engineering students, neither computer, so a PC is kind of important.  Am I the Asshole for wanting my roommate to do all the work right or pay for the labor to fix my laptop?

3056p1,,"I get that cabs have to get people from point A to point B in a timely manner but it is a huge pet peeve of mine when they bully other vehicles on the road way.  I was in the left lane driving through a light onto a bridge.  The left was for the bridge and the right lane was turn right only at this light.  Since it was before 9 there is a bit of traffic on the way to work but nothing crazy.  The cab drives up the right side and cuts in front of my car.  This is where I honk the horn, as he is only a few inches from hitting my front passenger side bumper.  He of course does the arm waving and flipping the middle finger thing, which ehh I do that myself.  But then looked like he was about to get out of the car when we were stopped on the bridge.  I locked my doors and got my phone out, took a couple of photos of his car including the cab company info and the state info. When the light changed again we started to move and as it opened up to two lanes at a T intersection (left lane is left turn only and right lane is right turn only) he did it again to the cars ahead of us and moved into the right lane and then turned left cutting off the cars there.  The cars had stopped to not block the intersection but the light was still green.  
  
I called the cab company and had to leave a voice mail for the complaint department. After looking online, I saw that this company has some problems resolving complaints anyways, and they want the city to ban Uber and Lyft drivers even though they are horrible with customer service.

30dtf7,,"**Background:** I have this co-worker who needs help with every move she makes.  I'm not a manager, but the office expects me to function as her manager, because you can't simply give her a task and expect results.  You have to explain every step of every job to her.   This is a college graduate who, if asked to neatly write and mail an already drafted letter, needs to be instructed how to use a word processor, how to print, etc. and does not seem to retain these lessons (nepotism at work, folks!).   There also are several things that are my job that have to be accomplished before she can start working on her part of the job.

So it is understood that anytime she works, she can't do a fucking thing without me dropping what I'm doing to set her up, and support her, and even familiar tasks require frequent interruptions after I get back to my desk.  Because of this, I have her come in on the same day every week, do all my work for he first, and I don't schedule anything else or let anything get close to a deadline that day, so if I lose the day, it doesn't cause any huge problems.  

**So here's the question:**  She can't come in on her normal day, so she just picks a random day and comes in without warning 30 minutes before I leave and starts working.  I drop what I'm doing, show her how her job works as usual, and just don't accomplish anything at the end of my day.  I leave when I'm supposed to, and she's still working.   The next day, the phone is ringing off the hook because the boss (her husband) decided he wants to execute something very complicated on an immediate deadline, and I'm collecting all the info &amp; finishing up documents that are involved while he checks in with tweaks and changes.  Boom, she shows up because she couldn't finish her job yesterday since I wasn't around all day to tell her what her password is, etc.  So she just appears and expects me to jump and tell her whatever little thing she needs to know first.

30hobf,,"Title says it all

Edit:  ok let me add a little background.
 I asked her to lunch a year ago, she told me she did and i backed off. Come December at the holiday work party, i was getting her car gas and she jumped me in the gas station bathroom and told me about the boyfriend as we were winding down. But i've continued with it this long. So Am I The Asshole?"
30jnon,,"Okay, backstory. I have a friend with a dog. Her lease is up this month and she needs to stay in the state for two months so that she can graduate college, the only problem is that while she is couch surfing, she can't have her dog. This is where I come in. I told her that I would be willing to watch her dog, we already have pets in the apartment, my landlord gave me the OK and I talked to my roommates about it, they were down, so long as we got a trial run. 



Cut to a few weeks ago, I dog sit while my friend is out of state on spring break. I tell my roommates to tell me if they see or notice anything that would turn them away of keeping the dog for the two months my friend will be homeless. I told them to tell me if there were any problems as soon as they noticed. Does he chew on stuff, if they started feeling allergic, if he was to loud, and so on.



Now today is the first day that we had the dog. I let my roommates know that he would be coming sometime this week, my roommate comes in and asks if this is the start of the long time we would have him, I tell her yes. And she flips out and tells me that she doesn't think that it will work and that she thought we were going to talk about it. I tell her that I explicitly said to them that they needed to tell me if there were any problems during the one week we had him so that if it was something we could fix that we could get it taken care of; and if it was something we couldn't fix then my friend and I could find him somewhere else to live. She is instant that she is allergic to him and I just tell her that she should have told me earlier. That way we could have found some place different. 



I eventually told her that I would try to find someplace for him so that she didn't get to uptight, but until I do he has to stay with us. So, am I the asshole?"
30nvml,,"My parents want me to go to the local community college, but like a lot of teenagers my age, (I'm a junior in high school) I want to go to college at a university in a larger city. My parents however aren't going to help me pay for college regardless of what I do, and they think I'm being ""rebellious"" and that I ""just want to party with my friends"" by wanting to go somewhere else for college. They also think that I'm going to end up with thousands in student loans because I'll be in college for 5-6 years because I'm partying so much. The student loan is a legitimate concern, but partying and extending the time I spend in college? Not so much.

He also told me that even though he graduated debt free, if I were to keep student loans to a minimum (around $5,000 or less) it wouldn't really be a big deal at all to pay off.

She didn't reply for a day, so I sent her another message saying that if she wanted to do something else I was open to ideas. After waiting two more days for a response, I told her that she could have at least replied, to which she replies that she's been swamped with work. We got into an argument about it, with her saying that people get busy and me saying that it would have taken her 10 seconds to send a reply.

Am I the asshole? I like this girl, and if I'm the asshole of course I'd like to apologize. However, I've been known to be a pushover and I'm trying to change that. Don't pull any punches, I want the truth. Thanks for taking the time to read! You're helping me become a better person.

"
30omuy,,"OK, another work situation with a girl I'll call M. 

  I work on the customer service desk with M, and the rule is that if you can't do a shift, for whatever reason, you should attempt to sort it out yourself and get a shift swapped with someone else, which my line manager is usually pretty much fine with (saves them the hassle of changing rotas). 

Now something I should mention is that usually three weeks worth of shift timetables are available. These are pinned up in the managers office, the staff office and there's a copy behind the CSD. Anyone who wants to check their shifts (or needs to) can go and consult any of these copies at any time. 
  
A few weeks ago, M asked me on a Friday afternoon if I could cover a Saturday shift, to which I said no. I found it totally unreasonable that I was being expected to cover a shift with less than 12 hours notice, and I wasn't particularly happy that her 'reason' for wanting that day off was 'because I promised my little girl we'd go shopping'. To me, the shift timetable had been up for long enough that if it had been that important, she would have spoken to the line manager and asked not to be put in a shift that day (which is entirely possible, I've done it). I told her this in a polite fashion and advised her gently that if she had availability issues, she needed to go to a manager and actually tell them. 

  Skip forward to last two days ago and she seems to be pulling the same thing again. I'm now covering her shift today for what appears to be similar reasons, and I'm not happy as this was supposed to be the start of 4 days of holiday for me. 

Now fair enough, things like childcare are an issue, and I can understand if some genuine reason to do with the kids or whatever is an issue, but to me the whole thing looks like she's using this as a trump card, and I'm being expected to give into every demand. magically virtually every other person with children in the store seems to cope just fine. 

So, AITA here?

30xh5m,,"Yo /r/amitheasshole! 

To preface, I carpool to and from my school with my middle-school age sister and a few neighbors. What's happening is my sister sings a lot. She takes lessons and stuff, and I'll admit, it's not necessarily bad. However, do not let her get near a car, because the second she hears Uptown Funk or Blank Space (among many other songs) on a station, she will belt out the entire song until it's over, then sometimes change the station to look for another song to sing. It bothers me to no end (my neighbors don't really care either way), and when I ask her to stop, she always scoffs and tells me I'm being rude. Am I the asshole in the situation, and is there a way to solve this? Sorry if this belongs in another sub. Thanks!"
55fmd6,,"I share a front garden with a neighbour and the front garden has maybe 50-60ft of hedge. We have shared this garden for probably 2.5 years and in that time I have (not figuratively, literally) always trimmed the hedge, disposed of the cuttings, blah, blah, blah... 
(I bet you've guessed where I'm pettily heading...)

So I had a really busy month at work, then went on a week long holiday, and DID NOT trim the hedge at all. So by this point it was as unkempt as a bag ladies bush. It really did look shit.
So my neighbour hires someone to trim the hedge, or maybe did it themselves, but I doubt it. But not the whole hedge, just the half that fronts their house. 

So this has really wound me up, far more than it should have for a supposedly well balanced individual. To the point where I have decided to no longer do their half of the hedge when I trim in future, despite this being likely to just piss me off as I'll still see the messy hedge.
So a two stage asshole question;
1) Am I an asshole for assuming they would reciprocate the work I had done if they ever did trim the hedge? (noting I didn't leave it to see if they would, it was just because I was busy/away)
2) Am I an asshole (preemptively) for deciding to only cut to the boundary that they went to next time I trim the hedge? 

Tldr; petty dude (also quite drunk) mithering about pointless bullshit, don't bother if you didn't read it the first time round...


EDIT
Well, it appears I'm not overwhelmingly an asshole (in this instance), but am probably petty, quick to judge and possibly unreasonable. Thank you internet!

If anyone is interested I will probably not do their side for a while and then just start again. Though it is coming into winter now so by the time it needs trimming I'll have forgotten all about it anyway... in addition to being petty etc I also have a bad memory!"
55j280,,"My friend and I are both in the process of moving across the country (east coast to west coast) and he has been planning what cities and attractions we will be seeing. I had no problem with this, as he is pretty good at finding interesting stuff for us to do. At the beginning of the trip he gave me a list of places we would be stopping, as we will be splitting off so that he can move south and I can move north. One of the stops listed was Las Vegas. I figured that would be a good place for us to part ways, so I told him that I would be our last stop together. I also told him I was only planning on staying in Las Vegas for a night.

My dad heard about our plan and decided to pay for a nice room in Vegas as a gift to me. I confirmed with my friend several times the date that we would be arriving in Vegas, then had my dad book a reservation for that date. A few days before we arrived in Vegas, my friend's parents met us so that they could continue the trip with him to his final destination. This was fine, as they had told us they had reservations in Vegas the same night that I did, so I assumed my friend and I could hit the strip before I left.

Fast forward to the night of the hotel reservation: I get checked in around 5:30, then my friend texts me that his parents actually booked a hotel an hour and a half outside of Vegas for the night my hotel was booked (despite both of us thinking that they would be staying downtown). He said that I should just do stuff on my own, and then he and his family would be in Vegas early-ish the next day. I told him that I wasn't planning on sticking around for very long the next day since I had a six hour drive before my next stop, and asked that he leave his parents after dinner and stay at my hotel, then we could all meet up in the morning. He said no, that he felt bad but he wasn't going to leave his parents. I told him I felt bad that my dad was spending all this money for a hotel because he thinks we're having a fun night together"
55nipi,,"Now I'm not going to name this user of course. Also they've since deleted the journal that this happened on in question, so I'll be paraphrasing.

So this user has made various depressive journals, and this one in question talked about how they wished they could make all humans disappear and undo the damage we've done. I took a bit of umbrage to this idea, and told them that I disagreed and thought that we should better ourselves from what we've done, instead of trying to redo what we lost.

He responds be saying how he doesn't see a point to life, and that he has a respect for mother nature and thinks that he thinks it's better to undo humanity and that we refuse to better our impact on the Earth.

I respond by saying as someone who once suffered from depression and better myself from it, I understand how they feel, but don't see a point in being so depressively pessimistic as a result. I then explain how we never intended to damage the Earth, and only really noticed our impact in the last few decades, and that we should try to better ourselves with what we have instead of trying redo what was lost because of us.

His final response accuses me of looking down on him and thinking I was better then he was, and then tells me to leave his page and don't come back.

Now my response back may have been going too far honestly. I respond by saying I tried to help, but he chose to reject it, and instead decided to wallow in his own self-pity, and how I lost any respect I had for him up to that point.

I have since blocked him, and I assume he did the same.

Now I'm torn. I don't know If I was being to hard on him and overly condescending at all, or if my frustration with him is justified. I have difficulties comprehending my actions sometimes, and I feel this may have been one of those moments.

I don't know, am I the a-hole in this situation?

55oync,,"To make a long story short (hopefully) I rent a condo with an attached garage. I live in it with my wife and school aged step kids. Sunday morning I notice the hot water heater is spraying water at the (not appropriately named anymore) drywall behind it which in turn is reflecting off said wall and wetting down the entire garage. This was 8am so it had been spraying overnight for an undetermined amount of time.

I immediately call my land lady who sends a plumber. The plumber fixes it fast and recommends  she have a water damage expert look at it. He comes quickly and assesses the damage using an infrared camera. Because of the age of the home and potential for asbestos, he described the correct by the law process to me (which I verified). He then called my landlady to explain he abatement process and recommended an asbestos licensed contractor to her along with his plan to set up several fans and a dehumidifier to dry it all.

She refused and stated her ""crew"" would handle it and simply rip out the existing drywall and replace. She called me to explain her position and I argued that I was concerned about the lack of drying equipment and potential for mold and mildew. (The garage smells terrible and it wafts throughout the house). I told her I didn't feel her plan was to code or the law. After this her attitude changed and after some berating my knowledge of this and how she is an expert... someone who didn't even give me the correct keys when we leased the place... she stated ""if you don't like how I am going to repair this then you can give me your 30 day notice, move out, and I will cancel your lease.

Her statement struck me as suspect. I ended my call with her and began researching this stuff. She sent a handyman over with a single small fan and he drilled holes into the wall (not legal in this situation) so the fan could dry behind the wall or some such nonsense.

Am I the asshole for insisting she make repairs to code? I am concerned for our health because as"

When this happens, he tends to go on a rant about how dishes are ""the only thing I have to do in this house"" and talks about how easy I have it. I admit, I do have it relatively easy but it's frustrating that he claims that dishes are my  only responsibility.

I currently do the dishes, clean the counters, fold the towels, clean my room, clean the bathroom, clean my hedgehog's cage, and sweep the kitchen, living room, and laundry room. It's not much, but it isn't merely dishes. So am I an asshole for being upset when he says it's the ""only thing I have to do""?"
55snbp,,"This happened awhile ago, but it still eats at me. So some second opinions would be nice.

I met this girl online. We started talking and quickly become friends, eventually evolving into best friends. During the friendship, I never got the opportunity to meet her, all our contact was over the phone/skype/social media/etc. Also during our friendship, a male friend and I were starting to form a relationship. It was exciting, and I would talk to her about it. She always sounded excited for me, too. And she was more than willing to listen to me when boyfriend and I were having problems. She was, in that sense, a great friend.

One day she told me that she had developed romantic feelings for me. She told me she loved me, and was upset that we couldn't be together. I felt bad, I really did. I've been in her shoes with other people and it always sucks. I told her I would stop talking about my boyfriend if it made her uncomfortable. I also made sure to tell her that this wouldn't change how I saw her or our friendship, and that I still considered her my closest friend. All was well for a bit after that.

But then she'd start bringing up her feelings every now and then. Just saying ""I love you"" at random times (times that would be totally appropriate if we were dating, but inappropriate that we weren't), telling me how much she cared about me and going on and on about it. And when she was having a bad day, would say she wished we could kiss and cuddle.

I never once got frustrated with her because she had feelings for me, I got frustrated with her because she wouldn't let it go. It was especially inappropriate because I had a boyfriend that she knew I was very serious about. I offered more than once to give her space if she needed, and she always refused.

So one day I told her that I was the one that needed space, that she was effecting my relationship (he knew about her and what was going on). She was very upset, but said she understood. I told her I still wanted to talk a"

I took another look through her pictures and saw that in some of her later pictures, she looked very overweight. Her initial picture wasn't a close-up of her face, she just looked pretty and a healthy weight.

However, I've been on Tinder dates before where their initial pictures were cute and their later pictures weren't, and the later pictures were how they actually looked on the date. In this case, I decided to ask her if she had lost weight since some of the pictures were taken. She said that the pictures were taken over the years and that the glasses may have an effect on her appearance (she was wearing glasses in all her overweight pictures). I asked her if her main picture was her most recent one (because she was very cute in it). She asked me why that mattered. I explained how I've been deceived before, and her response was that it shouldn't matter how made up she is in her pictures and that I'm just projecting insecurities. I then unmatched her, thinking that because she had been so dodgy with her answers, I was right to be cautious.

So, am I the asshole?"
55yzpc,,"I was talking to my friend on Skype (we are both adults) when they mentioned they were reading fanfiction about a particular pairing from a TV show. I said ""ew"", but they thought I meant the show and not the couple. They said they were surprised I didn't like the show because it was so much like another show I love. Our conversation got a little tense over that because I insisted that they were nothing alike.

While that was going on, I looked up the ages of the characters they mentioned, because I was pretty sure one was a young teen and the other was in his 30s. The idea of my friend being into something like that made me very uncomfortable, but I decided I should ignore it. My roommate saw and questioned me about the situation, then sent a message to my friend from their own Skype. (It was nothing more than a ""hi!"", but I asked them not to start shit.)

So my friend got suspicious and asked why my roommate messaged them, and I explained that she saw me looking up the ages of the characters. My friend then explained that there were no official ages of the characters, only speculations. They did admit though that there is likely a decent age gap, and that the wiki pages do say that one is an adult and the other a minor. They then assured me that they like the pairing only in the context of both being consenting adults.

I said ""That's a relief"" but it really upset them and they accused me of being a bad friend for jumping to conclusions and assuming they would be into a pedophilia relationship. I said I was just concerned and surprised, not trying to judge, and explained that ""people are full of surprises"" especially with internet friends and how anyone could be into weird shit. They tried to drop it but then brought it up again by mentioning that I didn't seem happy with them.

563054,,"I know not totally in keeping with this sub, but this seems like the best place to put it. My gf and I are arguing about what is considered cultural.

There was a wine store next to the restaurant we were eating at, and I said ""hey did you know that place has beer there?"" and she said ""well duh."" I defended my ignorance by citing that where I'm from you couldn't buy everything at the same place (by law, beer, liquor, and wine were all sold in separate stores); it's a cultural difference. And that's where the argument broke out. 

What I'm arguing is that my not knowing is due to cultural differences: Within the subculture of my state/county/whatever, since you couldn't buy all three at the same place, it's a cultural difference between where I'm from and where you're from.

My argument is based on 1. the freaking definition of culture which includes laws, 2. that other examples such as not being allowed to spit on the ground in singapore or the uk banning private gun ownership lead to cultural differences where a singaporean would be surprised to see someone spit on the ground in the US or a brit being confused by ""from my cold dead hands"" gun culture


Now here's my girlfriend with her terrible rationale:

Basically childhood friend shares [this](https://www.facebook.com/WhisperApp/photos/a.424652490884618.119983.424639800885887/1497250360291487/?type=3&amp;theater).
I say that, while I don't like Trump either, it's not fair to compare the two images because they're taken out of context. She comes back with a comment that was basically saying 'Stop being a nob and disagreeing with everything I say because it's my account'. I say that I'm not dissagreeing with everything I just don't think it's fair to compare the two photos.

She then said something that was just a way of saying 'whatever' and deleted the comments.
Really annoying to me because I wasn't trying to have an argument I just thought it wasn't fair to say that, and the fact that she just deleted the comments annoyed me further because if she didn't want to keep going I wouldn't have minded if she just said something like 'lets not argue' or just 'lets agree to disagree'.
Still, seeing her tomorrow. No idea whether to bring it up or just leave it and awkwardly avoid it (assuming she doesn't bring it up first).

56lto8,," So I have been working in a place for 5 months now and since I was last hired I got stuck with having only 2 shifts a week and then picking up shifts nobody else wanted, often at the last minute so if I had something planned I'd often cancel whatever it was to go work. I had one really busy shift that I had to work with another person and a really slow shift that saw me doing very little besides cleaning and stocking, generally picking up the slack of the other people who just didn't do any cleaning, or actual work.



   I made clear to everyone in charge that I'd love at least one more shift, unfortunately none were available I was told. Fast forward to a week ago, someone is let go and I was called to cover the shifts, which I'm fine with, and am happy thinking finally I can get close to full time, it's been a struggle! Instead I find out they hired this new guy who is friends with the manager, (really he is the owners nephew and has never worked in this industry before) and they want to be fair with the hours so we get the same # of days, but instead of having set days they are rotating so now everyone that comes in when I normally would be there and all of the people that I've told I work this and this day and time show up and someone else gets to benefit. I'm told this is all fair and etc. But I can't help being passed off and thinking it's exactly the opposite, am I the asshole for being mad. 



 Also the whole rotating shifts every week just went out the window as the schedule for this upcoming week is same as last. The people who have the good shifts have next to zero experience, leave the place a disgusting mess, and customers are always complaining about them but they happen to be best buddies with the manager/ nephew and his girlfriend."
56teeb,,"I'm 18, just recently graduated High School, and I haven't started work nor college yet (Work starts this week.) He's 16, and I love him, but we oftentimes have it out verbally. 

What usually ends up happening is that we'll go a week or two getting along, and then he does something or gets an attitude about something that absolutely drives me mad. Then, inevitably; we end up fighting about it.

Half the time I feel that I'm not in the wrong. What usually incites these arguments is the fact that I tell him what to do, even when my parents end up saying the same thing I do in the long run. No matter what it is, if it comes out of my mouth he's going to have an attitude about it.

Within the past 2 days, we recently had to mow. I usually do a good bulk of the mowing, and he gets the trim. That's how it's been for a long time and it works well with both of our schedules. So I let him know that the mowing needs done (Yesterday) and he goes out to do it. Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.

Flash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed.

We made plans for Saturday and that day she told me she couldn't come because of some ridiculous reason. I was ok with this even though it seemed odd. We then made plans for Sunday which she also blew off last minute. Then today (Monday) we made plans to hang out again which she once again blew off 30 minutes before. I haven't said anything to her yet  but I'm really upset. I made an entire weekend free so we could hang out and it seems like she doesn't care. (If it matters we are both in high school. Both juniors). So I'm I the asshole for being mad? I'm probably going to confront her about it today.

Little noises have always bothered me, and last night his phone buzzed by the bed side four times after lights out and while I was awake anyway, it grated on my nerves.

When I told him I found it intrusive on my quiet time he said I was being oversensitive and that I should be glad he has a social life."

This guy doesn't have a great command of the English language so it is hard to communicate with him, as I do not speak Spanish. To top it off my hearing isn't the best from years of playing music and working in that industry. Therefore, phone conversations can be hard for me to understand.

This guy will call me from his speakerphone while in the car. Couple that with his thick accent and lack of English and I honestly cannot make out what he is saying.

Last evening he did some repairs and was telling me he'd call in a couple days to set up a time to finish. I asked him to text and informed him of my hearing issue. I didn't mention the language barrier but he pushed back slightly implying he doesn't know how to write in English and as such would prefer a call. I insisted that text was better for me and I offered for him to even send it in Spanish and I'd have it translated. It's not difficult as I know a few people who speak Spanish who I could text for a translation or even use google. I told him all he needs to text me is a day and a time and I'll confirm or propose a new time. So the text exchange shouldn't be too difficult and I can figure the days in Spanish on my own. He still insisted on a call.

A group of my friends and some new acquaintances were playing a drinking game. Anna was in our shared room, on the phone. I went through our room briefly to get my bottle-opener, heard her laughing and saying cutesy stuff. I got back to the group and about 5 min later, Friend B (will be called Bonnie) asked where Anna was.

ME: ""She's in our room on the phone, I think with [Anna's bf].""

I said this because 1) she was in our room, 2) she was on the phone, 3) it sounded like it was with her bf and so this wasn't a vast leap of logic, and 4) the one time I accidentally interrupted a phone call by speaking to her before I could see her as I entered a room she got super mad about it and I figured she'd get mad about anyone interrupting her phone call. I didn't lay out this reasoning, only said what's in quotations above.

We continued our game. 10 min later, Bonnie leaves the room where the games were going on. Two min after that, I leave the game room and go into Anna's and my shared room to use the ensuite bathroom. In the bedroom, Anna and Bonnie are having a hushed conversation that abruptly ends as I pass through.

When I come out, Bonnie is gone. I say to Anna:

ME: ""Do you want to join..""

The unspoken completion of the sentence being ""...us in the other room? The French (a group of French people cohabiting with us) are teaching us a new game.""

ANNA (interrupting): ""Nuh-uh, don't you talk to me. I'm mad at you.""

ME: ""Ok, some other time, then.""

I reply, and leave. It's evident she's mad at me and was before I spoke, but I'd assumed it was because she hadn't been invited to join yet as well as for whatever mystery reasons have been making her mad this whole time. So, I'd thought I could remedy it by inviting her and trying to talk"

I found out about this from a friend who Beth doesn't know THAT well, so I was pretty insulted that she didn't tell me this

When I confronted Beth with this a few hours later she explained that she didn't tell me because she wanted to spare my feelings because she had someone new in her life and I didn't, even though I've been trying a lot harder than she has. I fully believe that this is the reason that she hid it from me but I'm still disapointed and kinda mad that she did it

I get talking to a girl (lets call her Janet) which is pretty drunk. Janet asks for a cigarette and we chat a little bit. Janet's speech was slurred and she had this look in her eyes that very/black-out drunk people get, and she didn't seem understand personal space, I had to keep stepping back.

Outside the club with my friends as we kind of lingering and saying goodbye to each other I see the Janet being led by a guy (Lets call him Ben (which I don't know)) . So I ask Ben quietly 'do you think that maybe Janet is a little too drunk? If you see what I mean'

The Ben was a little taken aback and got a little defensive. Ben said that he hadn't planed anything with Janet and that he just wanted to go home and sleep. We chatted a little and I wished him a good night.

I didn't think about this interaction until a few days later when I was talking in Skype with a friend (who wasn't there that night). I was telling him about my night, and this story came up. My friend told me that he thought I was a complete prick for doing that to Ben and a ""sjw"".

Which made me think. I might have come across very rude in Ben's eyes. My intentions were genuine, but then again maybe it was wrong of my to try and ""white-knight"" Janet, and that she was an adult and could make her own decisions. I mean I wasn't Janet's friend or anything, I didn't know her.

What are you guys think? Should I react differently if a situation like this occurs again? My friend seemed to think I was in the wrong, I don't, was I though?

She's really upset about having to leave, and she's said that I can come to live in her country so we can stay together if she has to.

She's brought up marriage once, while getting upset about her situation. She was sad that I hadn't brought up marriage as a way to deal with the situation and help her stay here with me. My feelings are that we should get married for love rather than convenience, and that the relationship is still too young for me to be seriously considering it. We've been together for a year and some change.

Am I the asshole?

57k9ws,,"It's a short story. 

I exercise a lot, and carry icy hot, to help my muscle pain afterwards. One day I offhandedly mentioned how difficult it was to get icy hot into the center of my back. She said and I quote ""It must be difficult, with all those muscles. Maybe I can help, and do it for you""

I took her up on the offer, and we went into the bathroom for her to apply the icy hot to me. I got hard pretty much instantly.

Afterwards, I thought that that meant she was into me, and so I flirted with her, trying to get the ball rolling so to speak. She showed disinterest in me, and at one point came into our place of work on her time off, and didn't even acknowledge me. She just got what she came for, and left, never looking into the back where I work for a second.

I'm not trying to spin it to sound like a victim, I'm just saying I flirted with her, she treated me like a skeevy pervet who's just trying to bang, and then after stopping we went gone back to a very normal friendship. I just want to know if I was an asshole for it?

Also, we are cool now, but I still always have this lingering thought that she thinks of me as a douchebag who's just trying to get with her. Even though I really do respect her and think of her as a good friend. IDK

Edit: She had a boyfriend at the time. Just in case that's important."
57lo0d,,"We adopted a Lab-Mastiff mutt a couple months ago.

This was to help keep my mom company as my dad and I both work long hours and my mom could use a dog to exercise with.

She has a tendency to feed the dog human food, and in quick to Google and stop her when the food is bad for the dog (watermelon rinds, grapes, etc), or let her know that the food is good for the dog and something that he should get as a treat.

After I left for work last night she fed the dog the remaining thanksgiving leftovers. I return home this morning to find the dog lying in his bed lethargic.

They explained what they fed him and I told them that they can't do that. That the dog doesn't eat human food that often, and never as a full meal replacement.

They said I shouldn't lecture them because they've raised more dogs, and I told them that they apparently need to be lectured because they need to know that certain things aren't good for the dog.

AITA for lecturing my parents about feeling the dog thanksgiving scraps and making him sick?

Edit - For those wondering, it turns out he just has ""garbage gut"" because he apparently ate a whole container of margarine Thursday night and I never knew. They didn't feed him the margarine, he stole it."
57n083,,"I'm in college and one of my best friends is visiting this week and wanted to see me but I told her I didn't want to.

We were part of the same friend group, but she graduated two years ago. Since then, my mental health issues got very bad and I became really withdrawn, causing the rest of the friend group to shut me out because it was uncomfortable for them. I understand that, even if I don't agree with how they treated me. I know it's different for me because I have mental health issues so I'm very sympathetic to others and their problems because I know it sucks when people are misunderstanding like that.

Anyways, the friend group turned kind of nasty towards me after she graduated. Instead of just ignoring me (which I would have preferred) I was constantly made fun of by them. They would joke about me killing myself and were just really insensitive overall. I couldn't really get away from them either because we were all really involved in a club and I had a leadership position, so I was kind of forced to stay on...

Anyways, the old friend group still like my friend who is visiting so much that they threw a massive party for her coming to visit. Another girl in my old friend group who I'm still sort of close with told me it was happening and told me that everyone else didn't want me to come.

So I stayed at home and didn't open their snap chats from the party. The next day, the visiting friend tries to play it off like ""oh we missed you last night!""

I've been really fed up with how my not-my-friends-anymore have been treating me. I avoid them but they still like to harass me from time to time. I know my visiting friend probably didn't tell them not to invite me, but I feel like she's still part of the group that bullies me so much. I told her I didn't want to hang out. I mean, what does that say about me if she has to arrange to see me separately because no one else can stand me anymore?

57polx,,"My group of friends haven't seen me irl for at least a month. I have two separate groups of friends, one are my classmates and one are my club members. When I first came to university, I constantly hung out with my club members since I didn't really know anyone yet. Since I started getting closer with my classmates, I've realised that I don't particularly like going out with my club members a lot. I like them individually as people but I just don't like hanging out with them as a group. With them, it feels very superficial. It's all smiles, and small talk. They always say they love me for my bubbly, talkative, and happy-go-lucky personality. Problem is, I'm not always like that. I'm a fan of comfortable silence but they're the types who think that when I'm silent, something must be wrong. I feel the need to always be talking, even when there's nothing to talk about. It makes our hangouts feel like a chore. The few times I've let myself be visibly sad in front of them, they've always just said something along the lines of ""don't be sad!"". No offers to let me vent, even though I've done the same for a lot of them. I also don't like their stance on alcohol. I was the one who introduced them to drinking, but I do it infrequently and know my limits. They now are of the opinion that things are only fun if there is alcohol involved. They're also a firm believer that friends must share everything with each other, if they're real friends. They get mad that I don't want to share all my secrets with them, and it makes me annoyed. They even got angry with me when I didn't let them read through my chat messages. I have no obligation to tell or show them anything. I used to go out with them every two days, now it's a surprise if I even go out at all. I still keep active in our group chat because even if I don't like going out with them, I still care about them. They're good people, I just don't enjoy myself with them as much anymore. They've stopped asking me why I don't show up "

57v6on,,"My grandmother and I are very close. I am probably closer with her than I am my mother, and I really think of her more of a mother figure than a grandmother. She lives close to me, within walking distance. I do not have a washing machine in my apartment, and I do drive (everything in my town is within walking distance lol) so I do my laundry at her house normally. Saves money at the laundromat, and we get to spend time together on laundry day. 

Well the past laundry day we out shopping &amp; to eat, we were running late, and while we were out, my clothing was still sitting in the was because I thought we'd be quicker and I'd have more time after running around to dry it. She offered to take it out of the dryer for me, and I could pick it up the next day. I was hesitant to say yes, I felt guilty tasking her with that, she told me it really wasn't a big deal. So I figured it wasn't a big deal, she could just pull it out of the dryer and leave it in my basket.

So I went to pick it up today, she wasn't home so I just grabbed it and brought it home. It was all sorted and folded. Now, I should be grateful I don't have to do that, right? I'm annoyed. She said that evening ""I'll fold it for you,"" and I said ""No that's ridiculous, don't do that."" I'm a grown woman, I feel bad enough that I need to rely on her to do laundry there. But I don't HAVE to rely on her, I went to the laundromat for months, until she offered to let me do it there to make it easier on me, so I figured why not? 

I'm annoyed because pulling a wad of clothing from the dryer into a basket is one thing. Her sitting there, sifting through every item of me &amp; my fiancé's clothing honestly makes me uncomfortable. What if I had some of my sexy lingerie stuff in there? She wouldn't say anything, I've bought nighties in front of her, but her sitting there folding them for me like a kid makes me uncomfortable.

Instead of saying ""sure"" or anything remotely polite, I get a ""Uhh, Im actually your hostess.."" in a really bitchy, Mean Girls kinda voice.

I myself am a waiter, so I know a bit about customer service and what not, but is it like a total no-no to bother the hostess or was she just being the asshole?"

She said it was for her and she wanted to help do stuff like make hampers for people in need and I should come because apparently the owner had offered free barista training for volunteering in the cafe. Only it turns out thats nowhere near what my mum has signed me up for as as soon as we me the owner she starts talking me up, how I'm a psychology student at uni(first year, don't really know how to calm down someone having an episode), how I've worked with homeless people before (another thing that she 'volunteered' me for without asking) and how I'm a great talker and an empathetic person (nope, have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the pass and had been medicated for it, still struggle to talk to people that are not friends or family).

581uqy,,"Earlier I was with my girlfriend of two years, and we've been talking about marriage (within the next 2-3 years potentially) a bit recently. She said that she wouldn't go through with it if her parents disapproved of me. In what I feel to be a perfectly natural reaction - I got upset and we talked about it. She expressed a fear that her parents would disown her if she married someone they didn't approve of, and expressed a fear that I would treat her badly after marriage (which she has absolutely no reason to think).

Now, her parents are a bit mixed on me. Number one it's not really 'open' we're together. My girlfriend fears them disowning her over it but they know anyway. Her mother likes me (though dislikes how I'm younger than her) and her father is downright passive-aggressive towards me. Number two, I'm not from this country so that's an obvious tick against me.

She tried to console me by telling me even if they disapproved of us, our relationship would remain the same. I told her that it wouldn't and that I couldn't be with her if she let her parents stop our future wedding. She berated me for being 'too lazy to convince [her] parents"". Where as I don't feel like I should have to because I'm not dating her parents. I can respect that she values their opinion but giving them the decision like that, I feel that's bullshit.

Near the end she kinda caved in and was like ""Well fine if you can't convince them after trying I'd go through with it"". I begrudgingly accepted that, then she told me she was hurt. This was about 6 hours ago and she's still really upset about it, but I don't feel I did anything wrong. I don't feel I'm obligated to stay with someone who lets other people determine what happens in our relationship."
584kr8,,"Here's the situation:

* I'm in a country where $300 is a decent monthly salary. So, this isn't all that trivial in terms of where I'm from.
* I have an iPhone 4S that's got a short-lived battery and swollen backside that pops up the rear, left-hand side.
* I have an iPad 2 that's got wear and tear.
* My father, completely unannounced, bought me a Galaxy Tab to act as both a phone and tablet.
* His reasons were to be more presentable in business environments and have a more reliable device, which would be important since we're in the steps of handing down the family business (from him to me) and a device that is fully functional and lasts from morning to night on a single charge would be ideal to be reachable by clients.

Here's what went down:

I thanked him for the thought. I realise that people out there don't have parents, much less parents that care enough to make such a gesture unprompted. I told him as much.

I refused the gift. I have $300 to $400 of apps I've bought over the past 5 years, most of which I use often. To spend as much to buy their equivalents (if even available) to migrate to Android doesn't make financial sense. It would cost $50 to get my phone fixed up or just as much to upgrade to a used 5S.

(And IMO, if a client dumps us because my iPad has some scratches or my phone isn't brand new, I'm not sure we ever had a chance with them in the first place. But he's all about keeping up appearances, so I didn't say anything.)

My mother later privately tells me that I was wrong to refuse a gift bought with good intentions and that it is demoralising to my father to refuse the gift.

In my honest opinion, he shouldn't have spent that kind of money (however much he did) on something I'd be using so heavily as a phone/tablet without asking me beforehand. In the days leading up to this surprise, I kept talking about ***repairing*** my phone, not replacing it. So, it's not like I planted the idea of a ***new. Android.*** in his head.

58b7on,,"I live in a shared house with 3 other people. I live on the first floor with housemates 1 and 2, and housemate 3 lives in a bedroom attached to the kitchen (it's in the back of the house and you walk through the kitchen to get there). We have a dryer in the kitchen next to our washing machine and I use it the most. The other housemates have been making a lot of comments on me using it. 

The person who lives downstairs doesn't like the dryer noise. As we are students, we are often in at random times of the day and he's frequently in all day, studying/napping, because he likes studying at home and not on campus. The others keep talking up the environmental impacts of the dryer and the bills.

I hang my clothes out to dry when I can, but I am more time pushed than the others - I have university for 3 days and also a job for another 3 days of the week, and I travel to a nearby city to visit my girlfriend, so I'm rarely in the house. It rains a lot so leaving things outside all day is risky, often they end up more wet than they started. I get in at 6 - 7pm mostly, so washing can't be done until late on evenings, or on the 1 afternoon/morning I can squeeze in to be in the house - often this coincides with housemate 3 being in her room, she is there most days. 

I don't wash things late at night, I dry things on the radiator when suitable (small items that won't make the house damp if windows are left open) and I use the eco setting on the washing machine (makes the clothes less wet so they dry quicker). The bills are the same as they always have been. There are 3 other people needing to use the washing machine so generally, leaving stuff in there for periods of time isn't good (plus they get mouldy). 

Am I unreasonable for being annoyed at this? 

Side note: one of the housemates is particularly preachy about loads of things environmental related. She's a vegan and she likes to constantly point out how we shouldn't use palm oil, Nestle, buy clothes from Primark, Topshop"

58w68u,,"The skype conversation (which was initiated by a lax discussion of Alzheimer's, and then became a debate) should contain all the relevant context. Some background information, however, is that my friend is currently studying biology and hoping to go into a medical field (which stupefies me personally that he would defend such widely scientifically debunked claims) and has always had a certain dalliance with esotericism and superseding relativism. He brings up religion at one point; I identify with an individual sort of freethinking Protestantism, while my friend is a disinterested agnostic.

The questions I'm trying to answer are: ""Are his views truly antiscientific, and am I justified in criticizing those views? Am I going about it like a friend ought to?""

This is the first time I've really decided to attack one of his views of this sort head-on. All the other times I've perceived something antiscientific in his beliefs, I've let it slide (partially because I myself can't stand the beating stick that some modernists have turned ""science and rationality"" into).

58ylm0,,"So I have pretty solid plans to move out of my parent's house in a few months. I have a place to stay and all that. I've tried to discuss this with my parents so I'm not just walking out the door one day, but they refuse to listen. They like to pretend it's not happening. I'm the oldest sibling, so I understand that cutting the cord must be hard. But it's bound to happen eventually.

I had posted on Facebook that I was at a bar near where I'd be moving to. A friend of mine commented saying I was minutes away from her house. I responded saying I'll be moving down there in a few months and we can hangout and whatnot. This was posted last night.

This morning I wake up to a text from my mom saying that before I go posting things like that on Facebook I should talk to her and dad first. I responded saying that I've tried and they won't listen. I know when I get home later today they'll want to have a discussion about how I need to watch what I post online and blah blah blah (I'm 21 for god's sake. I make an innocent joke about Ted Cruz awhile ago and my mom gave me a long chat about that).

Am I the asshole here? I feel like at my age, and the fact that I pay all of my own bills already (insurance, car, phone. Everything except medical.) should be grounds that I can move out basically whenever I want. Am I wrong?"
58yxl4,,"So the other day I was doing some math problem when my wife walked in. She joined me and together we did some calculations. When I looked over I noticed some odd step that I have never seen before.  When I challenged her on it she told me that's how she learned it and it makes sense to her.  It still gives the right answer but I have never seen (in any book) this step and felt like it was redundant. So we discussed this at length. Eventually it became an argument. Her sister explained that's how she does it as well. Now I knew where my wife found it. So I tried unsuccessfully to explain basic math with examples. We went to bed in disagreement. 

Here is the question :
500 - (-100) =600

My answer :
Negatives cancel out and the equation can be written as 500 + 100 =600

Her answer :

You can't just say cancel out and need to show it. Therefore it's really 500 - 1(-100) = 600. You go with bedmas and then add. 

I'm at a loss. Every book I have read just states the following: a -  (-b)  = a + b and not a - 1(-b).

We were drinking in the outdoors area, talking and people watching. I noticed a girl walking with a couple of people on the other side of the street wearing a really nice red dress. Being in the drunkenly uninhibited state that I was I called out to her. ""Hey red dress, you look gorgeous."" She smiled and sort of waved. However my friend chastised me for doing so, she said that it was misogynistic. My other friend, her boyfriend, backed her up and also told me off. He tried to relate it to me saying ""imagine if the roles were reversed, how would I feel?"" To which I replied I'd probably feel pretty good if some random person complimented me. I didn't approach the girl or have any further interactions with her. 

Am I a misogynistic asshole for wanting to compliment a woman who had obviously put a lot of effort into her appearance?"

592ij1,,"a couple months ago I moved back home to save some money. I'm a full-time student with some pretty intense classes. I spend a lot of time studying and doing HW. My parents seem to be really bothered by this. They never went to college so I'm not sure they understand how much time has to be put into school. My brother is also in school but never studies or does any HW and since he lies about his grades they seem to believe that no one has to put a lot of time into school.

Anyways, every night they ask me to go sit with them, have a drink or just hang out. Sometimes I do, but most of the time I can't. I'm pretty busy most of the day and the evening is the only time when I can get some work done. So most of the time when they ask me I have to say no. Not only do they not seem to believe that I'm studying, but they get pretty mad too. There's also times when they ask me to run errands and while sometimes I do, when I don't I get a lot of shit for it. It's really annoying because they always tell me how busy they are and it would really help them out to to run a bunch of errands for them. It's really frustrating because I constantly get a guilt trip for saying no to anything and then when I say I have to study they just badger me with questions about when I'm going to graduate. I wouldn't mind hanging out with them more and I do try to make more time for that, but a lot of the times when we do hang out everyone just sits around and doesn't say a word. So I start to feel like I just wasted time. 

It's gotten to the point to where I feel guilt studying or do HW. So AITA for picking studying over spending more time with my parents?"

This kind of news story except that a few dudes started to do such things in our local area while also robbing the people.
I wanted to listen to that story so I told my boyfriend ""be quiet"" in a quick and maybe rude way, while he was about to tell me something. The news story went on about a mother asking the radio station how to protect against such clown attacks and then my boyfriend blowed his nose with a handkerchief (we are both a bit sick right now) and he proceeded to put it in the toilet and flush it down....before he did so i knew what he was about to do since i could see it through the shower curtain and said quickly ""stop, don't flush, i want to listen to that story""(the flushing sound is so loud it would block the radio sound and well this story was important to me) i saw his hand basically freezing midway while telling him.
But then like 2seconds after i said so he did flush the toilet. 
It made me so angry i yelled loudly at him "" [His name], you asshole, this news story was important to me"".

I felt so disrespected by his actions, it made me angry. But then he got really angry and yelled at me back like ..how rude i am to him in his flat, and how i can call him an asshole about such a small thing like flushing the toilet.

Sara was undoubtedly my best friend my senior year as we talked (and still do) every single day. We hung out quite a bit (and for someone like me who's been a loner for most of my life, I mean that we hung out outside of school a few times a month). We've told each other big secrets and have big through some big life events together. I thought we were close enough that I asked her out the day of my high school graduation. She ended up saying no, and that she's rather just be friends and that she doesn't want to date anyone. The reason that I think she's embarrassed by me is that she will never acknowledge that I exist anywhere outside of our conversations. I've been told that if I'm brought up in a conversation that she will quickly try to change the subject and doesn't want to talk about me. She has also never posted anything on social media about me. Not a snapchat story, not an instagram post, not even a tweet. We even went to Prom together and she put nothing up about going with me, only a photo of her with her closest girl friend. We also drove to a resort community 60 miles away and she didn't even post anything about me going with her. That was a day I begged to have off of work from. Meanwhile, her face is all over my social media accounts. The night before I left we hung out for like an hour. The whole time she told me how she just wanted to go home and sleep. She also told me that she deleted a bunch of photos off of her phone because she needed space. It wasn't really a happy send off. Then after dwelling on it for a few weeks I asked her about it and she said it wasn't a big deal. I also suffer from depression and she doesn't seem to be very supportive of that.

I am a freshmen at college and my roommate (who I did not know beforehand) has a girlfriend. The rules of the school are people can't sleep over more than three times a week but his girlfriend has been sleeping over 4-5 times a week usually. I've tried to talk about it to him around 5 times with the first couple of times he said things like I understand and ok but the last time he said ""I don't see why this is such a big deal"". He has also said things like his girlfriend is having roommate troubles so I tried to be understanding and let her sleep over for the rest of the week but after that week it didn't stop. I feel like i'm paying a lot of money for a college dorm and I paid for a double not a triple and with his girlfriend sleeping over i'm getting all of the negative sides of a triple with none of the benefits of having one. I feel like i've been more than understanding but he has taken advantage of me. Am I the asshole for making a thing out of this or am I right to be annoyed? 

-Edit 1) Hey all thanks for the responses. To add more info about a week ago I filed for a room change but i'm very low on the list most likely nothing will become of that for a while. I have also contacted my ra and he is going to get involved soon! While I very much don't want to get my roommate in trouble or be a rat i'm not going to lie to the people in charge of room changes especially if that lowers my chances of getting a new room.

""God"" for me is a general concept, doesn't represent anything. To me, saying something bad about a god is the equivalent of saying something bad about my favorite rock band or pop artist. Sure it can awake passions but does it really give anyone reason to feel particularly offended?

59e61o,,"So I knew he did coke when we decided to room together. I told him before we moved in that I wasn't exactly comfortable being around it all the time. He told me ""It'll be a once or twice a week thing, I promise"". Well, I think he's got a pretty serious habit because it's basically everyday. He stays up all night every night usually playing video games by himself and blowing lines. I guess it doesn't really affect me that much, if at all. But it still pisses me off that he does it so much especially considering he told me he wouldn't. He's also annoying AF to be around when he's coked out and Im cold stone sober, but its not like hes aggressive or dangerous or anything. I've pretty much made a big issue out of it. We argued, yelled etc etc.

I should also point out that we are both in law school. So, its already a pretty stressful time in my life as is. 

Am I being the asshole reddit?"
59e7me,,"I know the title sounds like a joke and I obviously know I'm in the right but I really don't. So I used to be with a guy who was Mexican. We were together for over a year and he was my first love. 

Anyhow, since we were in high school, there was a lot of racism. His friends would even call him beaner but since he didn't seem to mind, I never said anything about it.

One day these kids are saying some really racism shit and I just can't take it. And so I tell them off for it. I later tell my ex and he gets mad at me. He basically said it wasn't my place and that I only embarrass myself. 

Is it not my place as a white girl? Should I not have said anything since I don't know what it's like to have racism towards me?"
59edy3,,"My wife is incredibly messy and lazy person and makes piles of stuff everywhere and then piles more crap on top and mixes important stuff with stuff destined for the trash. So today after picking up the kids I get home and start to clean up the house a bit. Wife comes back home later, asks where her papers are, gets mad as hell. 

Apparently, somewhere in the mess, sandwiched between junk mail and diapers was a pile of printed pages in no particular order or orientation, the top one with caked food on it, which I assumed was part of the usual pile of trash and various paper projects gone bad by the kids, was weeks worth of research on a case she's working on. 

Apparently, I'm an asshole for cleaning up behind her and the kids and not noticing her work. 

TL;DR: wife mixed work papers with junk mail and garbage, I'm an asshole for cleaning up."

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.

When I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big ""gift"", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. 

So it's getting to that time again and I figured my ""gift"" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. 

I even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me "

He wants me to give him my Origin information so he can play it on his computer.

59uwfg,,"The title is really poorly worded, so let me give some context. I'm a university student, last night I was at a club with a lot of freshmen like myself. I was dancing, and briefly danced with this girl from my year. Afterwards, this freshman I know (who I thought I was good friends with) and his friend came up to me and told me things along the lines of: ""You better fuck off, I mean this in the nicest way"". ""Don't come near her again, she's taken. Else, you'll be in trouble"". Mind you, this girl is not taken, and I wasn't trying to get with her anyway. I talked to the girl and she didn't even know what the guy was talking about. 

Now, I'm not a violent guy at all. But I was pissed. My buddy was around when this happened, and I told him what they said. He got mad and walked up to them, asking if they have a problem with me. Then I came too and pulled the dude who told me to fuck off to a corner, told him it's alright if he has a crush on the girl but it's not alright if he threatens me. I told him he better not do that again. My other friend is a big guy and he scared them pretty well, but when I talked to the guy he was full on denying that he ever threatened me.

I know he's the bigger asshole (at least in my opinion), but am I also an asshole for dealing with this the way I did? I also continued dancing with that girl just to spite the guy who told me to fuck off."
59w1hy,,"My girlfriend and I were going to some place she wanted to go to. When we were getting on the bus she went on about 3-5 seconds before me, as people rushed ahead of me. She sat down, and a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken/if she was with someone that would be sitting there. As she was reserving it for me, she told him it was right before I sat down.

About 10-15 minutes later with no provocation she let out a ""Can't even claim his own seat on the bus"" in a very annoyed tone of voice. I asked her what was up, she told me that I 'let a female claim [my] seat for [me]"". Now, me and my girlfriend are from different countries with somewhat different cultures, but I personally don't believe that attacking me for being 5 seconds later on a bus is acceptable in any culture.

I told her I feel it makes no difference who claimed it for whom. I happened to be 5 seconds later, I didn't intentionally lag behind so she'd be the one guarding the seat. I told her that I don't feel either of our genders really matter in situations like this, to which she replied with ""oh I see"".

I feel it's important to note that I am most definitely not the stereotypical man from her country. But the thing is, she likes that. The stereotypical man from her country is not gentle, is loud, unaffectionate, completely out of touch with their emotions, etc. And I'm the opposite on all of those. She praises me again and again for going against her country's gender roles/sterotypes but attacked me for not fulfilling one (by accident) that's convenient for her. All the while genuinely fearing that I'd expect her to fulfill her gender roles of the country (work + take care of kids alone, clean and cook everything, etc).

After more poking and prodding (me asking why it's such a big deal and her trying to weasel out of communicating) she told me that I should've just pushed the people out of the way, etc. I told her I wanted an apology because I felt like she made a not-so-thinly veiled attac"
59xs6m,,"So my brother is trying to become a cop. He's been going through background checks and the police departments have been coming around talking to people, including me. My brother and I don't get along mostly because he's super volatile, lies about me or too me and more recently has even stolen from me. He always tries to piss me off or mess with me by slamming doors when I'm around (he doesn't slam them when I'm not near by), trying to get me in trouble with my parents, usually by making stuff up. He's told them that I go around coughing in the kitchen, that I'm taking stuff from their office, it's all pretty petty. He even lies to me. He never cleans up after himself and when I confront him about it he just lies and says he didn't make the mess. He has taken my clothes out of the dryer mid cycle and told me  that I deserve it or that he didn't do it. He loves to make little comments under his breath about my girlfriend and I when we're around. He even got really angry that we went to my Moms birthday dinner so much that he started cursing in the restaurant and threw money at my dad when he left. 

More recently he stole some shirts and camping stuff I had. I know it was him because it disappeared when he was the only one in the house. And I also noticed he was checking out a shirt I was wearing right before it disappeared. Just a few weeks ago my girlfriend and I were at my parents house putting up curtain rods for them. My brother started throwing a fit as soon as he saw us. He turned on the TV which he wasn't watching at all nor could he even see it since we were in the way. He had the volume turned up super high, louder than he normally has it. He then went to my dad and told him, ""Tell them to fuck off! I'm watching TV!!"" and started slamming doors. This is just one example of his many outbursts that he has. He's 26 and has always had some serious anger issues.

5a0uqq,,"I got into a fight with my bf because I stayed at my friends house last night. We were going to a gig and she had a spare room and said I could stay because I couldn't get home without spending almost €30 on a taxi. The reason is because my shares her house with 4 guys and her bf a few years ago she tried to set me up with one of them before I met my bf. And we dated for about a week or two.
Now he's mad that I stayed in the same house as this guy. In my opinion that is just stupid although I said it in a much nicer way. 
So am I the asshole for going out and staying there even though I know he doesn't like it? "
5aatus,,"This is more of a would-I-be-an-asshole, because it's still going on.

Anyway, I flew down here to visit two of my best friends. Most of the trip seemed fun until the end when one of them, Lisa, started to lose her facade and start to show who she was when she didn't have guests over. She would bitch and complain about not having cash, act like everyone was out to get her, etc. My last straw was when she started putting her boyfriend over me, and her boyfriend decided to go off on me. Also, her and her boyfriend had sex on our friends bed despite this friend begging her to please not to.

So, my friend kicked Lisa out. It was a long time coming anyway.

The issue is, this friend still has some important, expensive shit. For example she still has the keys to the house and my friend doesn't trust her to have those. I left my very expensive, very elaborate lady Joker costume in her car after we went to comiccon. I need those back today because I have an early morning flight.

Lisa refuses to respond to anyone now. We've even tried to contact her boyfriend, who hung up, and her boyfriend's friend, who literally acted like a child and did the whole ""new phone, who dis"" kinda thing.

I finally told Lisa that if she doesn't want to return my shit, I'm taking something of hers equal in value. She still has her stuff here until she can come pick it up. I decided to take a bunch of pop funkos and some autographed stuff that'd all add up to the amount of my costume.

Am I the asshole here? I keep having guilt but I need this costume back and it's the only thing I can think of that would convince her to give it back. If she doesn't return them by tonight I will have to keep them, and maybe make an exchange to return it."
5acgc9,,"Tldr at the end...

This side of my family has had many problems and doesn't get along as well as it should. This story is very long and hard to explan though I will try my best.

My mother had my oldest sister at a time when she was too young to understand what she was doing we think, at 19 years old, and wasn't always the best. She didn't have the money to let her do everything she wanted and she made many mistakes by being harder on her than she was with the rest of us. I don't know the full story here and it's hard for me to talk on something I'm not sure of. Even so, from what I can remember, my mother has always tried reaching out to make up for her mistakes and all my oldest sister has done is be worse to her and even more so to my grandparents who have cared for her. She is selfish and rude to everyone of us. I know her life is hard because of her illness (RSD), but even before this it was still true.

Now to this situation, my mother recently told me that she is in the hospital. Apparently she had hallucinated from her antianxiety or antidepressant she had been taking for awhile. We just got the news that she has ulcers inside of her stomach that have been causing an incredible amount of pain.

Even though I don't wish this on her, I just felt emotionless when told this. My mother is emotional about the fact that her oldest child would be more stressed by her (their relationship is incredibly strained) being there than if she just stays away. I find myself just feeling bad for my grandparents and mother and not my sister. She never made any attempt to be a real sister to me throughout my life (she's quite a bit older than me) and I feel no connection as family.

Tldr: Me and my oldest sister have little to no connection due to family tensions my entire life. Am I the asshole for not feeling bad for her when she's in the hospital even though she's technically family?"
5acifc,,"So I was dating this dude for a year or so. He wanted to move up north to go to university near me. I told him 3 months but he needed to find his own place.

At the three-month mark my mom invited him to live there permanently. I kinda felt like I couldn't protest without consequences. Well another three months go by and the relationship goes sour I end it. In a sane world he would have taken his financially viable ass and moved out into his own place.

Instead dude quits his job which let him support himself while going to school for a slightly better paying one. Only to quit that one because it wouldn't fit his college schedule. He moves in with my brother but now my brother wants to kick him out. My mom feels sorry for him and wants to bring him back to my house. He has a new job now. God knows if that will last. 

His side of the story is that his parents kicked him out for being gay and he says that there are no family or friends that can take him in that live near the university he wants to go to.

I think the commute from his aunts house is about an hour but not all that bad. He has friends who would take him in if he was in a tight spot (like the one he got himself into. Mind you he financially destabilized himself the second I broke up with him.) who live closer to campus than I do. The only advantage of living with my family is social and physical proximity to me as far as I can tell.

My mom feels sorry for him, my brother is getting sick of his shit like I am, and I'm stuck with this guy who six months after I broke up with him doesn't seem to be moving on. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable that this guy is still part of my life after all this time against my will.

Am I the Asshole?"
5afndb,,"To preface this my roommate and I both work at the same store in the same department, so this is how something like this could happen.

My roommate clocked out to go to lunch and set his vest behind the desk that our department has.  A few minutes later I clock out for the day, put my vest down to put my jacket on, and accidentally grab his vest without knowing and leave.  This happens around 5 pm.

I head back to the apartment, grab some stuff because I'm going home to watch the Badger game with my family.  I leave the apartment around 6:10 pm.

Fast forward to 11 pm I've been drinking for a few hours and I'm kinda drunk, and I'm heading to bed.  I get a text from him saying I have his badge, and he needs it to clock in tomorrow morning.  Obviously I can't drive, and I'm going out with my parents the next morning since it's my birthday, and can't really make the drive back to the apartment in the morning.  I told him if he hadn't waited so long, I could have driven back and given him the badge, or leave it at the apartment.  So I tell him he can come pick it up either that night or right in the morning before work.  He declines both and doesn't text me until the next morning.  I  He wrote:

 ""So since you're so willing to drive to Creek, how about you drop off my vest, or are you going to be drunk for the rest of today too?""

Now I got this text at 7:40.  He told me previously that he worked at 8:30.  So there was no way I would be able to get the badge to him on time.  Turns out he worked at 11:30 and failed to tell me.

That really pissed me off so I muted his texts.  He really put me in a position where I couldn't really do anything.  He has no excuse for not texting right when he found out, which would have been around 5:30 pm that night.  Him waiting until 11 pm essentially squandered any solution that could happen, and he refuses to accept that because ""I didn't accidentally take the vest.""  And because of all this he had to pay for a new badge, and he is wit"
4m2vs0,,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 1,5 years. Things haven't always been easy, and about a year ago I met an old flame, didn't do anything with him, but obviously broke my boyfriends trust. After that I felt that he wasn't being honest, read his messages, and and saw that he had been writing with a girl he used to have a relation with, and there was some sexual messages. We worked though our difficulties but the trust was obviously broken on both parts.
Fast forward to now. I had the same feeling, and he hasn't showed me affection like he used too. Once again I read the messages, and found that he had been writing with the same girl, no sexual stuff this time, and he claims that it's just to talk to her. Things are shirty now, but I can't help but feeling that I'm not the asshole here? Or what do you think?

Edit:
I can see how this seems like a very immature relation, but when I wrote was a bit simplified to make it shorter. We do have a lot of good times and we are more often than not honest with each other.

Some people wrote that we were a high school couple, and that's not true. We are 24 and 23. The reason I used the word ""old flame"" was just because it's a guy that it has been a lot of tension with, without anything ever happening.

Thanks for the comments! Sometimes it's a good thing to hear that you're an asshole :)"
4m4wm4,,"Okay, so I'm back home for the summer (health calls for it) and my younger brother is finishing his last year of high school online (due to his hearing and learning disabilities). My mother has complained for the last two years that my brother has never done any work, but I haven't had a first-hand account of this due to me being away at college. (I gave him the benefit of the doubt because my mom is mentally unstable and for other reasons that aren't necessary to disclose.)

However, now that I'm home, all I see him do is play video games for hours on end-literally from the moment he gets up to the moment my mother comes home from work (a good 8-9 hours a day). He scrambles to finish 2-3 assignments per day to make it seem like he's working (in reality, this is a terrible strategy since he has 8 classes). He gets into these terrible anger fits when he can't play so nobody ever has stopped him until I came home. It doesn't help that I am (not can be, but am) a bossy cunt-I get pissed that he doesn't do his work and start ordering him around (totally my fault for losing my temper, I know).

Now, fast forward to the past week or so-my brother needs to finish his work in the next two weeks or else he has to postpone something super important that has been planned since birth (almost out of the question to postpone). So my mom has started asking me to 'check' my brother's work-apparently I didn't catch the memo that this meant 'do' his work, and when I didn't comply (because that is cheating) she said (and I quote): 

""You know what's cheating? Us giving you the money to take your GREs. Other kids out there have to work for that test and you just stole the money from us. You had an unfair advantage over those other kids. Now THAT'S real cheating.""

Naturally, I pulled a major bitch fit and spent five minutes almost yelling at her for various reasons, and stormed off. I guess she became apologetic because she tried to talk to me but I didn't respond (because no), and now"
4mblyv,,"So here's the scoop.

My boyfriend rented a cello for me for Christmas, it was very sweet. He knows I love the cello, but I haven't played for 18 years and even then I was a beginner. 

So, I get this cello, awesome. Then I break my back. Seriously, I had to get my spine plated and fused. As soon as I started healing (about 4 months later), I had to have knee surgery. 

I was unable to play the cello in the 6 months I had it. 

So now it is time to send the cello back and he's upset that I haven't played it. I get it, but I was physically unable. Now he wants me to pay the $100 return shipping fee. 

I've been out of work since the beginning of the year. I have no money, and I don't go back to work for another month. I told him I can't afford it. 

Now we are fighting about it. 

Am I the ass hole for not paying the return shipping? "
4mlvos,,"Hopefully you can leave party affiliations aside for this but I'm not a fan of cats. Definitely a dog person and this has been true forever.

My girlfriend (21) is about to move into an apartment with a friend. This friend owns a cat and it lives at the apartment. She's moving from her parents home where she currently has a cat and dog. Part of her decision to move was to be about fifteen minutes closer to school and to live with her friend, knowing this would mean seeing less of her pets and losing some space. She claims she has wanted this cat for a while but I haven't heard a word about it and I'm convinced that the new friend has sort of convinced her to get this new cat.

We talked (maybe even argued) about this on and off for almost 7 hours today while I was at work and now she's just worked up and upset that I'm not validating her feelings or understanding her point of view. So here I am trying to understand. We've been dating for a long time, she knows I'm not a cat person, we have some loose plans to move in together next fall, so any decision made now has to sort of consider that.  

As far as actual reasoning goes, this is what she has shared with me; she's worried if she doesnt get a cat now, she won't have the chance to later. She wants the other girls cat to have a friend. And that's it. Nothing about wanting something to take care of, come home to, or anything actually emotional or meaningful in my opinion. I don't see why she cant just enjoy having the extra time with her friend and the other cat and even see her own pets on weekends or whenever she wants to drive home. On top of that she's starting a new job and still has a year left of school so she has plenty to keep her occupied without having to take care of an animal. 

Feel free to ask questions but I'm working on getting to sleep soon so I may not answer until morning. Hopefully someone can provide some sort of insight because the whole situation feels like a really juvenile and pointless arg"

4mueq2,,"A bit of background. My wife and I have been looking for a new apartment to rent. We've only been looking for a couple of weeks. 

We've saved up enough money to cover agents fee, a deposit and the first month's rent but we agreed that we would tell agents/landlords that we are looking to move in at the beginning of next month. We both get paid at the end of the month meaning we would have plenty left over ater fees for any appliances, furniture etc we needed after we moved.

We've seen about 5 apartments so far. A couple of them, we realised, were a little out of our price range. One or two were a bit too far away from our jobs and family.

A few days ago, we viewed a gorgeous apartment that was well within our budget, was in a nice area, and was only 1 mile from where we work. Plus, the owner was a private landlord so there were no agents fees to pay.

We told the landlord we hoped to move in around the 1st July but we would pay the deposit there and then in order to secure the apartment. The landlord seemed to like us but said he had another couple arriving in an hour who wanted to view the apartment. He agreed to call us later that day to let us know if we had got the apartment.

True to his word, the guy called us that evening to give us the news that unfortunately he had given the apartment to the other couple as were willing to move in the very next day.

Now, where it gets tricky is that in the time between us viewing the apartment and the guy calling to give us the news my wife decided that she wanted to move in straight away and not in early July as we'd discussed. She insists she told me this but I cannot for the life of me remember that conversation. I am usually quite attentive so either my concentration lapsed or she told me when I was in another room. Or she thought she told but actually didn't.

It's been two days and she is still pissed because we should have taken the apartment straight away. She insists it's my fault because I ""didn't listen to he"
4mwqw2,,"The following exchange took place today between 11am and 7pm.
Oombao desired pizza. The first step to making pizza is cleaning the kitchen. Oombao cleaned the kitchen.
Floors: mopped, counters: scrubbed, cutting boards &amp; knives: spotless. Enter: Jiebaseo .
Jiebaseo displaced Oombao , and prepared chinese food using the recently cleaned knives and cutting boards. Jiebaseo inquired whether they were in Oombao 's way. Oombao stated ""how 'in-my-way' you are will be determined by how clean the cutting board is when you're done,"" and vacated the kitchen in favour of cleaning the dining room.
Time elapsed and Jiebaseo was ""done"" with the kitchen. They declared that they were going to lie down and put in some eye drops, which Oombao knew to be a euphemism for taking a nap. Not wanting to clean the kitchen twice in one day, Oombao stated the following:
""You've left the knife edge-down on a plate again. I've told you repeatedly not to do that and now I'm going to have to sharpen it again. Also you've dirtied two cutting boards, and there's rice all over the counter. You have made a mess.""
Jiebaseo stated that Oombao was picking on them, and had a nap. When they awoke, Oombao had re-cleaned the kitchen and was now in a bad mood. Oombao was not polite in informing Jiebaseo of this reality.
Jiebaseo again stated that they were being picked on, and suggested that the house would be cleaner if it had fewer things in it, namely the possessions belonging to Oombao; and it would be were they all absent. Oombao took offense at the suggestion and informed Jiebaseo that they were too fat and lazy to effectively pursue such a course of action. But, if Jiebaseo wished to make a contest of it, Oombao would gladly go tit-for-tat."

So pretty much I have this friend on XBox (I'll call him Bill) that I met about 3 years ago who I talked to every once in awhile. He lives in Indiana and me North Carolina (about a 10 hour drive). Another friend from work is familiar with Bill and could probably call him a friend. I have classes in June but Bill is talking about coming all the way to NC for a weekend. My work friend is excited and whatnot but I've expressed how I can't make any promises that i will be able to make it considering school and whatnot. Work friend is telling me shit like ""He's coming down to see you"" and ""He's YOUR friend"" even though the work friend is the only reason I talk to Bill as much (making a groupchat for us for example). 



I don't find it fair to say you're gonna drive 10 hours to hangout for the weekend without even discussing it first and THEN just expect me to be on board for it. I'm not the kind of person who's gonna make a promise I can't keep and when I told this to work friend, they said I was being ""rude"".

Last night I considered packing my stuff to be able to go straight from work but thought my gf would be put out that we weren't travelling together so I didn't bother.

Today she messages saying she's getting a lift with her flatmate because it's easier than meeting me. But I'm already at work this point, so I have to leave early to go home now anyways. Apparently she decided this ages ago but forgot to tell me.

This is just the most recent time, it happens with bigger things too.-' I right or wrong to be a little annoyed that I think of her first and change my plans whereas she just does what she fancies with me a last minute consideration?"
4n06w3,,"Btw my girlfriend isn't not saying she won't go on it she is unsure about it

4n1ljv,,"EDIT: What people need to understand most is that I gave up trying to get her to work out with me long time ago. Working out together has not been discussed in over a year because she constantly bailed on me. Prior to linked messages there was no talk of working out together or finding someone to train us together. I went off on my own to find a friend to teach me because she wouldn't ever go with me. This was my own thing that she had no part of. This was my decision to look for help because together we got nothing done 

This is sort of longi apologize but I want this to be as unbiased as possible so here Is link to the actual messages nothing altered except names blocked out.

one note as that when she says ""she has been trying to get me to work out for soooo long"" she really means ""hey want to work out next week or something"" then when next week comes says the same thing.

Edit 1: Just pointing out that she has not asked me to work outon over a year and when I try to work out with her she would make excuses and never go in the past. This message was originally about ME finally working out and I was pretty happy to get a start so I messaged her (my girlfriend) about it she flipped it 

EDit 2: This girl has not once asked me about working out in over a year. She has not once mentioned it nothing before this had anything to do with her working out or me. I have not worked out 1 time in my life and I am not comfortable teachin someone to work out because I do not know how, This was never about her until she made it about her"
4n430k,,"He's a childhood friend. In recent years he has gotten himself drug addictions, meth and heroin. He got his kids taken away a few months ago and he's trying to get back on track, despite slipping up all the time, I still love him (no homo) but it's starting to tear me up inside. We'll make plans to chill but come time I can't get a hold of him. a few days later he'll show up at my place and tell me slipped up and wants to get his life back on track, like a broken record, until he finally decided for himself to move back in with his parents. So weeks go by and I don't hear from him because I'm thinking he's clear across town at his parents rather than a few blocks away from his old house but he asked around 9:00 if he could stop by for a bit to figure out what he's doing. I say sure and he arrives with many fresh pick marks and looking very gaunt he tells me he's finally moving into his parents (same thing he said weeks ago) and out of his house then he asks if I could give him a ride but unfortunately I only have 1 car and it wouldn't be back until my SO gets home from work at 1:00AM so he mentions he has a bus token but then he falls asleep on my couch and I mean he is Zonked didn't stir from an awkward sitting neck kinked sleep for hours until my SO gets home at 1:15 I then wrestle with him to wake up so I can take him home only for him to tell me it's to late for him to go to his parents, he doesn't have a key, he hasn't officially moved in, and he didn't tell where else he could go. Now my SO is very frustrated and I'm pretty frustrated too although she doesn't want him to stay here at all. she doesn't trust him and I don't blame her.

http://imgur.com/dHYFkcA

I was in lane 3, in line to enter my University as there was a bit of a congestion at the gate. In my country, most people are dicks, but I wasn't raised as one so I never cut in lines and I'm very hostile towards people that do. These lanes are connected to the main road, obviously, and people saw there was a line in Lane 3 and just went past everyone who was there first (me included) by going through Lane 2.

I was pretty pissed by the situation and when it was my turn to go through the gate (after someone from Lane 1 passed) a guy from Lane 2 tried to go before me and I didn't let him, bumping my left side rearview mirror to his car, which prompted me to roll down my window and scream: ""Don't skip the fucking line, asshole!"".

When I got to class, a friend of mine says to me ""Hey, I drove past you at the gates, haha"". I was still pissed about it and just said ""Oh yeah? I didn't notice, I was making sure that those assholes cutting the line didn't get infront of me."" And she said ""No one was cutting through the lines, though"". I didn't pay much attention to it, but then it hit me: she was one of the assholes at Lane 2, and she totally thought she wasn't doing anything wrong. So, am I the assohle here?"

I'm a White Boy by Merle Haggard

It's racist as hell. i recognize that. it's from a different time, i recognize that. Hell, it's basically just a song protesting affirmative action.  Merle was never the most forward thinking man, but damn if it isn't the catchiest song i've ever heard. I'm a huge Merle Haggard fan and I love this song, but people keep trying to point out to me that I can't love this song without being a racist. Thoughts? "
4n6643,,"A while back I was waiting in a long line at the airport, I think it was to get through security but it may have been to check in (but it was *not* to get on the plane). It was a winding line marked by those retractable barriers, so the order was very clear.

This was a long line that I ended up waiting in for more than 30 minutes. I decided during this time to re-arrange some of my possessions in my luggage. Although I moved up in the line when I could, at one point I had to go deep into my suitcase and over the course of a few minutes (maybe 2-3 minutes) a decent-sized gap opened up between me and the person in front of me in the line (perhaps 15-20 feet). I was nowhere close to the beginning of the line at this time.

The group behind me asked if they could go ahead of me, because there was space for them to stand there.

I said no, because IMO the space didn't matter, only the order in the line. Although there was a physical gap in space in front of me, this wasn't impacting the actual progression of the queue at all, since there was still a long wait ahead of me. There was also plenty of empty space in the back of the line. I felt it was fair that I keep my place in the line.

After this point an employee at the airport opened up the barriers to allow this group (and others) to get in front of me. I ended up waiting several minutes longer because I lost my place in the line order as a result.

Am I the asshole for wanting to keep my place in the order of the line even though I was rearranging my luggage?"

4namte,,"My girlfriend and I live together in what is a relatively expensive apartment for our area ($1675 per month). I make double what she does in a month, but we split rent and groceries 50/50, but I pay for 95% of our meals out which is usually at 1 or 2 times a week. We also both pay for all our own car/health needs (doctors visits, car maintenance).

Recently she brought up to me that she often has to choose between important things she needs taken care of. Basically choosing between going to the dentist, the doctors, getting her car worked on. With this she mentioned that she thinks it is unfair that we split all of our living needs 50/50, because she has to choose between these things while I do not because I can cover (mostly) anything that comes up myself.

I also should mention that I have always been incredibly frugal when it comes to spending money on things I deem as ""entertainment"". So basically music, video games, electronics, or anything I have fun with I will only spend maybe $150 a month on. Because of this I have accrued a decent size savings account which is what I use for surprise appointments for myself or my car.  Meanwhile she doesn't have any savings because she has only recently realized the benefits. I also graduated from college last Spring and continue to pay off ~$1500 in loans every month.

So am I the asshole for not paying more because I make more? Or is it fair that we are splitting our base necessities 50/50?

EDIT: Just for reference, I have offered to help her out with her dental/doctor's bills because I believe these things to be important. However it is frustrating because when she does have extra money she will often use to to buy clothing or something for our apartment (not necessities, things like extra chairs or plants)."
4nq3be,,"Josh gave me a missed call the other day, even though we cut off all contact because he ""can't be friends with someone he's had romantic feelings for."" (We were close friends, then started dating, and because he was catholic, he said it wouldn't work out and eventually asked for a FWB thing instead, and then told me we couldn't be friends at all) 

I used this subtle method of contact (lol) to tell him that he might want to check his penis out with a doctor because I highly suspect that he has phimosis. I know it sounds completely random, but I wanted to state it matter-of-factly without sounding like I still cared about this jerk. I felt like I was responsible for telling this to him since I am the first person that he has engaged in any sexual relations with.

He replied with lines like ""yeah keep telling yourself that (you are telling me this just because you care about it as a health issue)"" [what does this even mean?? that he thinks I want him and this is my way of telling him??], ""I don't care, doesn't matter"" ""even if I did care, I wouldn't be discussing this with you"" ""the only issue I have right now is that I am talking to you""

I got angry and told him his penis is just the tip in terms of the many flaws that he has. Now, I meant this as a bad joke, because we used to joke like this a lot, but I was so frustrated with trying to understand him and why he hates me so much. 

A day after I began to see how my statements might have emasculated/insulted Josh and texted: ""I apologise for being insensitive about the topic. I only told you because it *can* be a health issue and didn't mean to insult you in any way. There is nothing wrong with your body. Don't reply.""

So - am I the asshole here?"
4nqcnz,,"Basic backstory: I met this girl online, fell in love with her, and moved 1000 miles and into Mexico to be with her.

The conflict:

One Saturday we were supposed to go to a little reunion my girlfriend and her old classmates put together.

I had been in Mexico for about two weeks at this point, didn't know anybody, didn't speak the language, and didn't even have internet on at my house yet.

The day of the reunion came, and I texted her to ask when we were leaving to go that night. Her response was that she needed to ask her friends, but she thought they were going to flake. And she said if they flake she just wants to spend the night alone and just be by herself.

Being totally alone in this place, I was kinda frustrated. I told her that sucks because I was looking forward to doing something that night, and she said sorry, but she needs time alone (""I need to be by myself for a while.""). I said alright. It made some sense because between us, school, and her family, she wasn't getting as much time alone as she was used to. I didn't like it because given the circumstances I had a ton of time alone, but I wasn't going to try to force her to do anything.

Later that day I asked if they flaked, and she said yeah. I asked what she'll do for the night, and she said she didn't know, maybe just stay home or go to a pub near her house.

That night I asked if she decided what she was going to do, and she said that she's going to pick her friend Joe up to go to the bar near her house because he was supposed to be playing in the band there that night. 

I felt weird, and I told her that. Because she specifically said ""alone"" and ""by myself"" a few times, and then she was going to pick another guy up to go to a bar. (A guy who was kinda odd towards her. We were in the mall one day, and he excitedly waved to her. On our way out she got a notification that he posted that he was with her at the mall. He was also always asking her to party or where the party is or to get high with h"
4nsc2x,,"So my SO and I plan to go to EDC this weekend... last year, his former FWB told my SO that he wouldn't be able to go and would sell his ticket because he had no money.  My SO, being nice, offered for him to ride with us AND stay with us, for free.  I wasn't asked, so I was extremely upset last year.  I was bitchy the entire time. Even though he ""had no money to go,"" the guy brought a bunch of alcohol with him. 

Fast forward to this year.  It happened again.  The other guy won't be staying with us, but he asked for a ride again.  No offer to help pay at all! I'm already sour and it's ruining it for me.  I still want to go of course, but i'm in a bad mood all fucking day.

If that guy offered to help pay, it would relieve some of the resentment I have towards him.  But it wouldn't get rid of all of it.  He still ""owes"" us 1/3 of the hotel and ride from last year, in my mind. SO and I are now fighting about it.  He says no problem, they're ""friends"" (to me, they're not).  For me and my own best friend, we've always split the gas money to go to vegas. AITA?"
4nt23z,,"We both have some pretty hardcore issues with getting chores done. I hate cleaning up after him, and he hates cleaning up after himself. We'd left the dishes entirely too long and I was finally tackling them. I was almost done cleaning off the stove (which was covered in fish fry oil splatter from his cooking the other night) and he came in to cook something for himself. I asked him to wait until I'd finished cleaning it off, and he went and sulked at his computer. I quickly finished, told him I was done, and he replied that he'd wait until I was out of the (smallish) kitchen since I'd yelled at him last time. I did raise my voice, when he came up to hunch over me as I was washing a rather large skillet and trying to rinse it in the small, shallow sink before putting it in the dishwasher. I told him to back up after bumping against him a couple times. I'm sure I sounded annoyed.

Am I the asshole?"
4nt7z4,,"This happened a while back, I hope that's not a problem. I've always been confused by it, though.

Context:
The coffee shop I used to go to gave out a chip with your purchase, which you could put in a container that dictated where they would donate a small percentage of your purchase. At the time my then gf was studying optometry and is pretty passionate about the career.

Situation:
One day we got coffee together and she noticed that I put my chip in a bin that had something do with homeless people, and there was another bin that had something to do with supporting an eye care clinic I think. Forgive me not remembering the details.

She said I should have donated to the clinic because she cares very greatly about it. She said I wasn't supporting her. Homeless people make me sad, though. AITA?

edit: I remember she added that because it was such a small gesture, it shouldn't have been a big deal to accommodate her."
4ntkig,,"Not sure if this is the correct place to put this, but I'll give it a go.

A few days ago I was hanging out with my friend in her car when she decided she wanted to drink. She got fairly drunk, and I wasn't going to compromise my own safety by letting her drive. We were pretty far away from either of our houses, and the only way to get back was to drive. Obviously I wasn't going to let her drive, so I took it into my own hands.

 While I was driving, a raccoon ran out into the road and I ran it over, damaging the underside of the front bumper somewhat significantly, (the underside panel ripped off, causing all her windshield wiper fluid to spill out), but the car was still completely fine otherwise. At the time, she didn't care at all (because she was drunk) but now she's blaming me for it.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay? I feel like the technicality and legality are that I should pay, but the morality of the situation makes me feel otherwise."
4ntsf0,,"Hi Reddit. I hope you can help me. I feel like I should let you know a little background info. I have Aspergers and see things very much in black and white. I am married. I have five kids ranging between 12 and 1 year old. I work part-time. My coworker, Nala works full time. She is 23 with no kids. 

So I guess the situation started a couple months ago. Nala mentioned in passing her mom told her she had a month to find a place of her own. She often talks about her mom not letting her have a key and her mom telling her she wants her to find a place to live. A month goes by and I find out through Facebook that her mom went out of town for the weekend and she has no where to go. I message her and say just come sleep on my couch for the weekend. She does. Sunday she goes back to her mom's house. 

Two more weeks go by. Now her mom is not letting her in the house at all. I talk to my husband and we let tell her she can couch surf at our house. We are led to believe this will be a short term arrangement, after all she has supposedly been preparing to move from her mom's house. 

I allocate a drawer in the fridge for her, i begin putting some things together for her that we have around the house. A kitchen table, TV stand, pots, pans, cups, rugs, I even go to some yard sales and get some things for her. We have never asked her for any money for rent, or using our things, or eating our food. 

Four weeks go by. I let her know we have an out of trip coming up in two weeks. I let her know she will need to find somewhere to stay while we are gone for five days and the exact dates we will be gone. 

A week before our trip she goes and sees an apartment. She says she likes it but won't have the money for it till Friday (payday and day one of our trip). I let her know that sounds good, but just make sure she has arrangements in case anything falls through since I will be out of town. I also ask another co-worker if they will make sure she has a place to go and help her out while "
4nulm9,,"So right after I got my schedule on monday for work I got a text from my friend that I work with saying ""Hey can I have your shift saturday"" basically I worked 4-8 he worked 11-4 so he wanted the to just extend that day and get some extra hours. This friend also makes websites as a side job. So come friday I get a text saying ""Hey I scheduled a meeting for my website thing with some clients so you may have to take your shift back"" I told him well can't you just do the meeting before work or on sunday and he said ""No also these 2 sites are gonna be worth like 2 grand"" I told him well you should try and find someone else to take the shift he said ""Im just telling you you need to take your shift back this is in your hands now"". That pissed me off to no end i didn't believe that these meeting were only flexible during the hours he had work but i just didn't respond. The next morning comes I'm pissed off thinking this is BS I was gonna just relax and go to se graduation parties and he's sitting there acting like my boss demanding me to work the shift he asked me for. So I called him and said I'm not working that shift my brothers graduating college and i have to go to his graduation which was a lie and that hes just gonna have to work. He gets mad and calls my boss my boss took my side saying you can't plan something on top of a time you have to work and just expect the person to take their shift back for all you know they could have plans or not even be in town. So now he told my boss to tell me he wont be talking to me anymore. I don't think he should have planned something without knowing if I could work or not, and when I tell him he should find someone else just demand that I work because he has better things to do.

4nwbjq,,"One of my best friends is having a bachelor party next weekend in NYC. A friend of his planned out the evening and booked a 12-14 person limo for 9 people. However, he did not consult us before he booked it and then told us it will cost $225 per person. 

The limo will take us to the city, drive us around to our destinations and take us back home afterwards. Although this is great, I think it is very expensive, and unfair not to ask us before he paid for it. He now expects us to pay him back by the end of the week.

A few of the attendees, including myself, have low paying jobs and this is not a small cost by any means. I really think there could have been a better way to plan transportation and I feel if I back out, not only will I cost everyone more money, but I'll look like a jerk. I understand you cannot put a price on friendship, but I can't be the only one who thinks this is a little crazy to ask."
4o4thj,,"So let me preface this with a couple of things. 

First, I am a known headphone guy. I love headphones and audio in general, but I am very picky. Everyone in my family knows I am a headphone guy as well.

Second, I'm not trying to play victim. The other party is by no means in the wrong, but I may or may not be.

Just wanted to get it across before I begin. 

So it's November an my Uncle, who I have been living with for the past 4 to 5 years, asks me what I want for Christmas. I ended up having to decide between a new motherboard and a new pair of headphones. I finally settled on a new pair of Audio Technica ATH-AD900X's. They are well known to be a very open, very neutral set of headphones that I had my eye on for a while. I tell my uncle this and make sure to tell him that they are not available in most retail stores and if he is unable to get them to buy the motherboard instead.

Christmas roles around and he goes to Best Buy in search of the headphones. He is in his 50's and is very oldschool, so he doesn't know the first thing about technology. He barely knows what to look for. He ends up unable to find them, so he asks an employee about headphones. The employee, who is also not knowledgeable when it comes to audio, sells him a pair of Turtle Beach's for well over the price of the intended cans. For those of you who don't know, gaming headsets have really terrible audio quality with the exception of one or two, which aren't even spectacular. Turtle Beach is especially bad. So Christmas roles up and I open the package to find exactly what I was fearful of. I put on a face because I'm not going to act like a 12 year old because I didn't get what I wanted. He included the receipt in the wrapping because he knew I was very specific in what I asked for.

I take that as permission to return them with no hard feelings. A few days later I return from a local shop with the headphones I wanted. Immediately upon walking through the door he looks disappointed. It's pretty "
4o5a1o,,"To be blunt, my home life is very toxic. My mom is manipulative and controlling, feeling the need to seep herself into every aspect of my life and make me feel like shit. Her and my dad are in the weird middle of getting separated, which makes things awful. They're both just fighting for my love and side in the divorce. My younger brother and I don't talk much, and my older brother is a Marine so I never see him.

 I graduate high school this Friday, and then leave in August to live on campus for my college. I didn't have a choice in where I went to school, I only got to apply to only one college, the one my mom works at and is 20 minutes away from my house. She constantly threatens to not let me live on campus, which is my one escape from my house. She knows this. 

Basically, my plan is to work my ass off and save all my money so I can move right out of my dorm into an apartment, no need to go home. I feel like an asshole for this because my family barely has any money, and my mom is paying all my tuition/room/etc. right out of pocket. We didn't get any money from the FAFSA. I feel like if I abandon her, she will just hate me and stop paying my tuition, leaving me stranded and forced to drop out of college. I also would feel like an asshole because my whole family would know that I just abandoned her in her time of vulnerability (the seperation from my dad.)

The thing is, I just can't be at home. I struggle with anxiety/depression and I honestly feel it the worst when I'm in this fucking house. Theres no safe place here. When I was younger, my older brother would do sexual things to me in this house. My parents got separated in this house. I've been abused in this house. I understand that for my own well being, I have to leave, but I feel like such a fucking asshole. I feel so bad leaving my mom in her time of need and I know that everyone in my family will just blame me.

In an iMessage group chat, the topic of how we were going to get there comes up. None of us can drive because we are all teenagers without licenses. We try our parents but none of them are willing to drive us there. An idea pops up in one of my friends head: Uber. Okay let's just use an Uber that could fit all six of us (expensive) to go to a place that is miles away from where we live (even more expensive.) Keep in mind this would be doubled because they were planning to take Uber to and from the amusement park. I ask them how they're going to pay for this Uber and whether there will be an Uber drive who will be willing to drive 6 kids to an amusement park for 2 hours. Especially when we leave it will be 10 pm at night. We needed a card for Uber anyway and everyone claimed they only carry cash. One girl, let's call her Dana, suggests that I pay for the Uber, using the fact that she remembers that I had one against me. I don't have much money in my debit card because what goes in there is basically allowance money and gift money. I tell her in private that I don't want to use my card. Dana replies with, ""Why Not?"" I told her if she had her own card she would understand. 


Well this private conversation with her gets screenshotted and sent to the group chat where we were making plans. So much for private messaging. Everyone is in the chat act offended and say ""exposed!!!!!!!"" They tell me that they're going to give me money so I can put it in my card before we go on the trip. But how are they so sure that "

I gave him 3 month's notice and told him I'm moving in my with S/O. He flips his shit, tells me I haven't given him enough time to save money for a big move like that. He'd just blown thousands of dollars on tattoos. Why didn't I tell him sooner? Unlike me he didn't come from a coddled rich family etc etc etc.

For 2 months he's made passive aggro insinuations that a pampered trust fund kid like me would never understand the difficulty of a mentally ill poor kid like him, and that's why 3 month's move-out notice is cruel and not enough.

4obf97,,"So I am a high schooler who drives a car that is a little too nice for me. I've been working since I was 11 and I put a lot of money into getting this car (Not all of it, but a significant amount). Included in this washing my car twice a week, and spending hours just caring for it. It's honestly one of the few things I care about, and when people mess with my car I don't take it lightly. 

So the incident happened yesterday when one of my friends decided to do a slide across my hood. When he did this he put a pretty good sized dent in the hood. I was immediately pissed and he was also immediately apologetic. He said he would pay for the damage and I agreed. I think he was expecting around $60 to fix it, and I was too. I managed to fix it a little bit, but there is a very slightly noticeable crease in the hood that only I can notice, but it is there.  Today I was driving around and went to 5 different auto body repair shops, and all agreed I needed a respray, which would be around $400. I know his family can't come close to afford paying for it, but he damaged my car and I'm insisting that he still pays. It's such a bad place for me to be because I know that he can't afford to fix my car, but he should take responsibility for his actions. He's a good friend and I don't want to have to take it to a further step if he can't pay. I don't want to risk the friendship over a dent, but I don't want the dent in the one thing I care about. Am I the asshole for making him pay?"
4og510,,"Please ignore my bad engish.

I live in a very boring city. I used to go to the same bar with two other friends, *A* and *B*, but five months ago we found out a bar with a pool table. Nice, finally something different to do around here. We go there all the time now.

The thing is, friend *B* has a girlfriend and she is sick of watching us playing pool. Friend *B* stopped going out with us two months ago because of his girl.

I'm still going to this bar with friend *A* and a few other friends. Friend *B* is upset because we dont hang out much anymore, he wants to go to another places, but the 3 of us did the same things for years. I wanna play pool for now, friend *A* wants to play pool too. Sometimes we go to another places because of friend *B*, but friend *B* stopped going to the bar with the pool table.

AITA?"

4orf18,,"A while back I left a job to focus more on school. Money ran out faster than I thought and my parents, who own a small business, offered me a job. I took it because it was flexible, I could work from my place and mostly because I needed money. We all agreed that it would only be temporary as they didn't want me becoming dependent on them. After a while, my mom would even get irritated with me because I still had not found a job. 

Recently I found a job so I put in my 2 weeks notice and left. However, they still come to me and ask me to do things for their company. It's easy stuff like entering data, but with my new job and summer school I've been super busy. So I don't really have the time or the desire even to work for them. But I still get emails from my parents asking me to do stuff for them. Whenever I say no, I get a guilt trip. I get told that it wont take that long and they would pay me for it too. They even tell me that I'm not helping out around the house all because I don't want to do more reports. But I just really don't have the time to and I really don't want to either. So, AITA?"

I've grown up around cars and bikes all my life so it's a big part of my life. I've had my eye on a BMW E30 and I recently found one with good mileage and at an affordable price. Any person reading this who likes cars will know my reasons for wanting this car. So I rung the guy about buying it to get more information etc. So I'm going to see the car this weekend. I told her about it and showed her photos, the main reason she doesn't want me to get it is because 'it's ugly'. She also went on to say how it's stupid because it's 25 years old and will constantly break down, I understand her reasoning behind saying it but old BMW's are very reliable and rugged cars. I've been working hard this year in my apprenticeship and I feel like I deserve to buy this car, so I'm going to buy it, but she just doesn't understand why I want it because it's ugly and doesn't belive that it'll last a day before I get problems with it. I'm buying this car because I've worked hard and it is honestly one of my dream cars to own and I have an opportunity to buy it now so I'm taking that chance. We got into an argument about it as I was taking her home from work earlier and I just want to know am I the ass hole for going to buy this car even though she doesn't want me to?"
4p1hcu,,"Me and my friend made a bet on if she would do well in a maths test at school, she did do well so she owed me ten pounds (I'm British just couldn't figure out how to do a pound sign on my computer). Anyway she was refusing to pay me and as I always pay up i was pissed that i wasn't getting my tenner.

So a few weeks later at a party we were both pretty drunk. I went into her jacket and took out a ten pound note, seeing there was other money in there so I wasn't robbing her broke.

I told her straight away and although she was angry at me we had a laugh about it and she 'let' me keep it.

Was i the asshole???"
4p33fj,,"My friend and I are both musicians. We play in a band together and see each other regularly. Back in September he went off to school to become a band instrument repair guy. I had an old clarinet laying around and I thought ""hey, maybe he could use this to practice on."" I let him take the clarinet with him so that he could use it as a practice instrument, something to mess up on or fix or whatever.

He kept the clarinet from September to May, his entire program, giving me updates here and there along the way. He would tell me this week they were doing pad work, that week they were working with whatever tools. One day he told me he needed to replace the pads and he could get them for a low amount, so I told him to get me an amount of what it would cost. He never got back to me.

Flash forward to today, he texts me and says ""I have your clarinet, it will be $300 for the repairs."" I kind of respond in jest, thinking he was messing around, to which responds he isn't kidding. His reasoning is that $300 was a third of what it would have cost had I brought it in to a shop.

I'm between a rock and a hard place. Part of me thinks that, at the end of the day, I got a completely overhauled clarinet that is probably in pretty good shape. He performed a service on the instrument, and he should be compensated. Maybe I should have been more aggressive in knowing the price of everything. The other part thinks, he never quoted me any kind of number before doing the repairs. He just told me out of the blue what the cost is going to be. And, because he's a pretty good friend of mine, I feel obligated to pay. 

I agreed to pay $100 a month for the next three months. Today I asked him for a receipt, just so I could see exactly what he did that would constitute a $900 repair job. He replied saying we don't have to worry about a receipt because there are still some moldy pads that need to be replaced, but because he doesn't want to work on it anymore and I don't want him to work on it anym"
4p8ggs,,"My birthday's in a couple of weeks, and I have two friends of mine that used to be best friends with each other (Let their names be Bean and Nana).

A few days ago, Nana obliviously said a very, VERY insensitive comment to Bean, and Bean insisted that Nana should never speak to her again. Nana had been saddened and enraged about this whole thing and has attempted to apologize to Bean multiple times, but it didn't work and it resulted in Nana getting blocked on every form of social media, allowing no form of communication between them. I've been trying my best to comfort Nana and help her feel better without badmouthing the other, but Nana is still very bitter. 

Earlier today, Nana expressed to me that she hoped that I wouldn't invite Bean to my birthday party, but I had already invited her. She then started to name every ""reason"" why I shouldn't invite Bean (she's fake, you don't talk to her as much as you talk to me, she's a b*tch, etc.) Nana's not very happy with me, as you can probably tell. It is true that I am closer to Nana than I am to Bean, but it just wouldn't feel right to have a party without Bean, and it feels rude to just un-invite her.

Am I being an inconsiderate asshole to Nana by wanting Bean to come?"

We can't close on our new house until the 14th of July and are staying with my parentson.

But he has to do condo stuff while I watch the kids so guess who has to do all the prep for my supposed to be a surprise party. That's right. I get that honor. On my actual birthday I just wanted to have dinner with my fsmily, but my mom was sick, so we didn't go. Fine, it happens. We reschedule for today. She is still sick, so she canceled with my grandparents and sister without asking and then said, well, you don't mind, right. I do mind, actually. I would like to go to dinner and she could just sit it out. But no, that is unreasonable. She days she wants to be part of a dinner she is paying for, but I never asked her or expected her to pay for it. I just want to go out and actually have a nice evening out. On my actual birthday I got to sleep in, and that was about it. My husband took it off, but after going onowhere a business trip last week and being going non stop with all we have on, he was tired and checked out and I basically did what I always do, which is to take care of the kids. I didn't go for a walk, which I asked to do, or take the kids five minutes down the road to a merry go round because that would have been fun.

4po9sj,,"Due to gaming on his computer, my boyfriend often stays up until the wee hours of the morning. Sometimes he doesn't even come to bed until I get up for work at 630am. I go to bed between 10-11 usually on work nights. 


I've spoken to him on at least 3 separate occasions about how this affects me and how I feel it isn't good for our relationship to frequently go to bed at different times, if it can be helped (which it can, he doesn't work.) Every time I've spoken rationally and calmly, using ""I feel"" instead of blaming him for anything, and every time he listens well and agrees with me and promises he'll work on it. Yet he continues this behavior.


I understand that it is not my place to set a bed time for him; he is a grown man and can do whatever he wants. But the fact of the matter is it affects me emotionally, something I can't help even if I try. Sometimes I'll get up around 3 or 4 to use the bathroom, find he isn't in bed yet, and then be upset enough to take half an hour to fall back asleep. Going to bed together is important to me and he knows this.


So am I the asshole for being upset??


Edit: also, the reason bed time is so important to me is I pretty much only have 4 hours of free time between work and sleep"

4pr9li,,"I was about to close up work today when I got a text from my sister asking if I could go halfers with her on dinner. ( She ordered Chinese food and it was a lot more then she was expecting. ) I'm very careful with my money and don't like spending it on unnecessary things.

I got into the car and asked her how much my pitch in would be, I'm going to be honest here and said it in kind of a pissed off tone. She she'd we'd split it 60/40, alright cool I'm totally fine with that, it's going to hinder my plans for this weekend since I set myself on a very strict budget but that was fine.  

She then asks if I can pay for all of it and she'll transfer me the money later. I say what ever just to drop the conversation but at this point I'm kinda of pissed off because I have to take out an extra $100 from my bank to pay for this.  We're close to the bank now and she asks if it's okay that she pays me back in a few weeks for dinner because she's not 100% certain how much she'll get paid next week. I don't answer because I'm getting a bit more ticked off since it went from me paying half, to me paying it all then her transferring me the money to you'll get it in a few weeks. She's done that kind of thing before to my sister and she never got paid back.

So at this point she gets mad at me for asking her why did you order the food if you knew you couldn't afford it line and that's where that ended where she got pissed off went to the bank and paid for it herself.

4q3j91,,"If you're interested, here's a [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4ppio6/my_26m_parents_60mf_want_to_see_my_current/) to a thread I did on this in /r/relationshipadvice. 

I am a 26 year old guy who is getting a second degree and living with his parents. I am also a complete shut in loser, and I literally have  no friends. 

Anyway, so my parents and my therapist are great people, but they did something that has hurt me to my core. My parents have been struggling in their marriage ever since I was a small child, and probably before that. I have begged them for years to seek marriage counseling. Unfortunately, they chose my therapist to go and see. 

The reason they did this was complicated, however it ultimately boils down to my father having trust issues, and he has known my therapist for about forty years. They have a professional relationship, and that is ultimately why I was recommended to her by him. 

Now, my therapist and my parents are my only social contacts. I am far too shy to say anything to anyone at school. I have a roster of mental health diagnoses, but among them is a pretty nasty case of social anxiety. 

Anyway, I feel betrayed by my therapist for not only meeting my parents, but the entirety of my social circle behind my back. I am considering firing her, despite liking her a lot, because my trust in her is fundamentally shaken by this. My parents are begging me not to, citing that I have grown a lot since seeing her, and that it would be tragic if I did indeed leave after this mistake. My parents insist that no therapy took place in this situation, but instead, the therapist said that she would counsel them only if I allowed it. I am totally not okay with that, since I live with my parents, and my therapist would not be seeing me for me if she also got information about my life (at least indirectly) from my parents. I think that is fundamentally a terrible idea. 

What do you think? Am I the asshole for wanting to fire "

4qh352,,"Hey guys, so I know breakups typically go with walls of text, so I'll be as brief as possible

Was with my girlfriend for a year and a half. I noticed she randomly started to never want to be intimate, always go out with her friends instead of spending any time with me, and just seem really uninterested and distant, which is super painful. She also started spending (a lot) more time than I was comfortable with with this other guy, sometimes just not coming home until the next day. I was pretty pissed.

Anyway, her birthday rolls around and she has a party at our house. I fucking cannot stand her friends and I know this fucking guy is going to be there too. In the spirit of fairness in storytelling, she knows I hate them and always go out of my way to avoid spending time with them and will just ditch if they come around because fuck them.  They are all just such trash, I could go on. I begrudgingly take the night off to attend it, though I suck at hiding my emotions, so I'm fairly hostile to the guests. Not yelling or anything but a couple snarky comments and a very rude exit (I'm not going to pretend I handled it well).  I just go to bed early. 

I wake up and she's gone and won't respond to texts. Finally at 1pm she shows up in that guys car. We get in a big fight and go on a ""break"" for a week in which she basically refuses to talk to me , because apparently the silent treatment is a great way to resolve conflicts. Anyway, that ends and we have this brief, fucked up ""open relationship"". She's still never around ever. Everytime we talk she seems distant and we fight a lot, and she always brings up how I acted like an asshole to her friends at the party. She also tells me in some weird vague way she thinks I'm abusive and jealous and possessive (I would deny the first, but I'll admit readily to the latter 2).

I eventually break up with her because I'm sick of being constantly ignored. We still live together and fight a lot. We have a big blowup about her relationsh"
4qh38s,,"So my gf and my birthday was a week apart.  I was out of town for business so we decided to celebrate few days late and for her birthday present I took her to NYC for the weekend including 4 star hotel and a front row seat to Aladdin on Broadway, her favorite disney movie and a dinner at a 5 star restaurant and a beautiful pearl necklace to wear to it.  Originally she said we should just combine our two birthdays for the trip but I told her no cause I wanted my birthday to be about me and her birthday to be about her (plus I paid for the entire trip).  So it was just to celebrate her birthday.  We get back from NYC and its the day between getting back and in 2 days is my birthday.  Her roommate's father passes away.  She and her roommate is very close so she decides to accompany her the wake but promises to be back in time for my birthday.  Next day she calls me and says due to miscommunication that she's actually gonna be there another day and will miss my birthday.  I understood and I told her funeral beats birthday.  However I don't hear from her me entire birthday, she comes back next day in the afternoon and when I brought up making up for missing my birthday and doing some post-celebration she simply asked me ""didn't you celebrate with your friends and family already?""

TLDR+additional details
So i understood her missing my birthday for her roommate's father's funeral but got mad for several other reasons, primary center reason being she didn't seem to care about my birthday at all

Instead of suggesting something something to do on my birthday or come up with a plan she just wanted to throw it into her celebration

her-It makes sense, trip is right between our birthdays
me-yeah but I am paying for the trip and want our respective birthdays to be about you and me separately

Didn't hear from her at all on my birthday

her-I was at a funeral with a broken phone

4qn1gw,,"A couple of days ago, I was out biking on a mildly busy road (about 4-5 bikers around, only one car nearby). One of the other cyclists went into the center of the lane, planning to turn left at the upcoming stoplight (she didn't signal for her turn). The driver, who came up behind her about 8 seconds after she went into the lane, honked his horn at her as he was stopping (behind her at the light). I gave him the finger, as I thought that was pretty out of line. Once we got the green, he flew past her accelerating to about 30, missing her by about two feet (as she was turning).

At this point, I was furious, and decided to let the guy know how I felt. I caught up to him at the next light, after blowing past a couple of stopsigns (which were clearly and visably empty, making this illegal but not dangerous) and gave him the finger again. He got out of his car and started yelling at me, ""What is your problem"" etc. I told him my problem was that he had honked at a girl for no reason and buzzed her, which was dangerous. He responded with ""Shut your damn mouth or I'll shut it for you"", and proceeded to call me out on blowing past the stop signs, and said he had honked because she didn't signal her turn. I said I had done it because I wanted to confront him on his dangerous driving. We were both pretty angry.

Anyway, a couple other bikers came up behind us, which was fortunate because I was seriously a bit concerned this guy might get back in his car and run me down at this point. He got back in and drove off.

So, I know that the driver is a serious asshole, but was I way out of line here too? I thought he should know how dangerous his driving was, but maybe I should have left it alone."
6xb5m0,,"I was in the subway with my friend, next to a pole. An elderly lady was sitting about 6 feet from us. I was hanging on to the pole, and my friend wasn't, so when the train started, he went back a step. The lady told him to hold on to the pole to not fall on her, and he did.


Anyway, I moved a bit and forgot to hang on to the pole. Again, the train started and I went back one small step, not touching the lady. She told me to hang on to the pole this time she looked a little angry. The way she said it was quite blunt, so I told her I'm sorry, but I haven't touched her. I didn't hang on because I'm usually careful (never fell while doing this).


My friend then exits the train and while I walk to a seat, the lady mumbles ""Yeah, sit down."", to which I respond ""What did you say?"" and proceeded to take a seat. The lady looked at me and turned around.


The lady wasn't very respectful, but I still felt like an asshole for talking back to her and not simply ignoring her (I'm 18, so it doesn't seem fair to confront a woman much older). Also, I feel like an asshole because despite her way of telling me to hang on, I could've simply obliged.

6xb9sw,,"So my brother broke his arm about 2 months ago and recently had surgery. The doctor said nicotine slows healing or causes tissue and bone to heal incorrectly. My brother is constantly asking to smoke my vape and I tell him no for the reasons above.

6xhojo,,"I'm home on vacation for a short amount of time before leaving the country for a year. About a week ago my brother introduced me to his friend, let's call her Cecelia. Now, Cecelia and my brother work together, and have been friends for a bit over a year, as far as I'm aware. Cecelia also just got out of a relationship that she was in for about a year. 

Before I met Cecelia, my brother told me, ""I wouldn't be able to handle Cecelia's crazy, it's probably somewhat related to why she's no longer in the relationship she just got out of.""

I hung out with Cecelia at my brother's apartment a few more times this week and every night Cecelia and I would stay up talking past midnight, even though she had to work the following day. I wasn't really able to sleep well do to being incredibly anxious about moving out of the country, so we just talked. 

On the third night Cecelia and I kissed and slept on the couch together. The same thing happened the fourth night but at some point my brother came out and saw that her and I were cuddled up on the couch (completely clothed mind you). I saw him because I really wasn't able to sleep much, and I heard him come out.

I decided to tell my brother that I had a thing for Cecelia, because I didn't want it to come and bite me in the ass. After I told my him that I had a thing for Cecelia, he told me he kind of saw it coming, but asked me not to act on the feelings I had due to her just getting out of a relationship, and my leaving the country for a year. He also mentioned to me that he has had a thing for Cecelia for the past year and a half, but she's never been single for long enough to get over her ex's. 

I've talked with Cecelia a bit about the situation, but she just doesn't have the same feelings for my brother that he has for her. And her and I both want to get to know each other more.

So am I the asshole for still wanting to get to know her better?"

6xqyf1,,"So this happened last weekend. I was in Seattle with my best friend who was up from New Jersey visiting me for the weekend. We went to one of my favorite pizza places in town, Windy City Pie. They do a great Chicago Style Deep Dish, so the pizzas are pretty filling. I normally go plain but they heavily recommend getting toppings so I got an extra pizza for my friend so he could try some of their toppings while I had my cheese pizza. It turned out to be too much for him to eat so he decided to give his left overs (about 2/3rds of a pie) to a group of people waiting in line who seemed a little hesitant about the wait. They were really grateful and bought my friend a beer. It wasn't until afterward that I realized we just cost the place a pie, but I think we may have also gotten them some repeat business from the people who might not have stayed for their pie anyway given the wait. So are we assholes / did we do the wrong thing, or is it something that isn't really that big of a deal. I don't have a lot of insight into the restaurant business but I know it can be difficult."
6xvf2m,,"So my boyfriend of 2years is moving in with me on Tuesday. He lives with 3 of his friends in an apartment downtown, and I have my own apartment on the other side of town. So far I've done most of the prepwork myself, I've disassembled my old couch, bed and other various things and moved them downstairs (4 flights) on my own or with the people who bought them from me. I've also moved the new ikea things upstairs with the people who delivered them. I've been sleeping without my bed since Friday, and I'm living surrounded by boxes since Wednesday. 

Tuesday he's going to hire a van and deliver his stuff to mine, with the help of his mother. I'm really glad, to me it's a special moment. It's the day we finally move in together. I kind of, sort of, expected that we would have dinner afterwards. Also, it's a lot of work. Moving stuff from there to here, assembling 3 closets, a bed and then putting all of our things into them. Clean up the place and stuff. It will take at least all day.

Here's the catch though; one of his friends from overseas that he only sees once every few years is over. He's been here since yesterday I think, and he leaves on Wednesday. They were supposed to meet up tonight, and see each other maybe tomorrow as well. But that was cancelled. Now he and his friends want to have dinner together on Tuesday. At 7pm. My boyfriend thinks I'm an asshole for telling him that I don't like that. So, am I an asshole? Just saying that I'm not forcing him to not have dinner with his friend. I just told him that I didn't like it, and that he can do whatever he wants.

TLDR: Boyfriend is moving in on Tuesday, instead of having dinner with me and his mother, he will leave after dumping his shit in my apartment and go for dinner with a friend from overseas he can only see once every few years."
6xw66t,,"My friend and I were kind of mad at one of our friends we had got into an argument with. However, I realized that the argument was totally useless and childish, so I forgave her. We began talking regularly and such, and my other friend found out. It wasn't really good after that.

She was saying things like..

""Why are you friends with her again? Weren't we just mad at her? She's/You're disgusting! Did you remember what she did to me? I can't believe you just betrayed me like this.""

I am still yet to understand her reasoning for saying things like that, since the argument was very petty and not a sensitive topic. 

I want to break ties with her, because of all these unnecessary comments she was making just because I was friends with her again. But am I an asshole for doing that?"
6xyy1g,,"I was on the underground last night with my earphones in. This guy comes along the carridge and he looks like hes about to ask people for money. I can't really hear what he is saying but then he looks at me and asks me a question. I take out my earphones and ask him to repeat himself and he asks me to choose from 5 different words. I choose one and he goes on to say that he is a traveling poet who will make a poem based on the word I chose, and at the end we can give a tip if we like it. At this point I'm thinking oh shit I don't want him to busk as I do not have any money, but maybe it will be ok as I am off at the next stop and maybe I can sneak out. The guy proceeds to quickly ramble this poem that I could not really hear a word of, that finished just as we got to the next stop (now I think about it, they are probably planned that way). He finishes and asks for some coins. I tell him that I'm sorry but I do not have any money and start to move towards the door. He gets a bit annoyed and squares up to me a bit and asks why I chose a poem if I knew he was a busker and didn't have any money. I tell him that all I heard was him asking me a question and that I didn't hear the busker bit until after, but he doesn't believe me and eventually walks off swearing at me as I leave the train. 

Now I will admit that I am stupid for both not realizing he was going to ask for a (compulsory) tip, and that I did not stop him from reciting his poem. But was I an asshole? 

TLDR- stole a performance from a tube poet"
6y0bkw,,"I caused a motor accident, in which I was the party at fault. To explain the situation simply, I drove into someone while trying to evade an emergency vehicle. 

There was only minor damage to both vehicles, but the other driver did not have insurance, which complicates things a little.

My insurance company approved my claim and repaired my vehicle, but they seems to have found a legal loophole to decline the other driver's claim (the involvement of an emergency vehicle; this is not in the USA, if you're wondering). The other driver is therefore left with a damaged car and no payment, unless she can muster up legal fees to take on my insurance company (which I suspect she can't).

I have not spoken to lawyer, other than the one that represents my insurance company (and me) against the other driver. 

Am I the asshole for leaving the situation as is? Should I be trying to help her personally? I could try to find the money to help her, but it would be a huge knock to my finances. "
6y2tex,,"A lady friend I've known for over a year accompanied me to vacation resort (my treat) in June. She also agreed to accompany me on a road-trip to Montana in September. It had been 6 weeks since our last conversation (we're 900 miles apart) and when I sent a text a few days ago reminding her, she acted surprised to hear from me. She said she was working and will call me at 7:30p when she gets home. At 7:30 no call, 8:30 no call and I sent a text saying I'll call. No response, so at 9:30 I call a full voice-mail box. I didn't want to assume she was flaking on me so the next day (18 hours later) I sent a text wishing her luck with the emotional issue preventing her from calling me. 16 hours later, still no call but a text telling me I was judgmental because her cousin needed her more than calling me to ""catch up"". She also tells me everyone comes to her with their problems and she should charge for being a shrink. This is now two days after she said she would call me. I text her that there was nothing judgmental and I just wanted her to be considerate about keeping her word. I also told her if she's too busy, maybe we shouldn't remain friends. BOOM! She says I'm being a judgmental asshole to the only person willing to keep a decent relationship with me, and she was helping her cousin out with a problem so I can cram it up my ass! Huh?! Game over, I replied simply. Okay. 
If it makes any difference, it cost me $2.5K for her part of the vacation. I never said a word about it because I had a good time even though she friend-zoned me."
6y38z6,,"I'm a new grad student. Today one of my deskmates brought her emotional support dog into our studio workspace. I asked her about it and she told me it was an anxiety dog, which is a little ironic because dogs give me major anxiety, although I can work with it if it's a well-trained service dog and stays away from me.

This dog was not well trained. It whined loudly the entire time it was there, wouldn't sit still, and barked whenever anybody entered the room. It was distracting and the barking really freaked me out. I wound up needing to move to a table across the room, which helped a bit but isn't typically an option.

From my understanding, emotional support animals are not permitted in classrooms (I have an emotional support cat that I would never bring anywhere public), although from googling a bit I found that there are exceptions to this. I emailed my professor asking for clarification and he told me he would find out for me.

I would be really relieved to have this dog out of the workspace, but otoh I feel bad being so afraid of and distracted by this girl's anxiety support dog, which obviously she must feel she needs or she wouldn't bring it with her. Should I try harder to adjust to the animal? AITA for wanting it out of the class environment?"

so last year i was best friends with amanda. like, up each other's ass best friends to the point where we were planning to have a joint graduation party this year. then, this summer i went to an academic summer program and while i was gone, everyone got closer without me. apparently everyone was also annoyed with me talking about my summer program, i really loved the place and the people there and i was excited to share. but no one had told me something was brewing until the day i got back. i was talking to amanda and she was giving me short, one-word responses like ""ok"" to everything. i was so frustrated because i felt like something had been off just like this for the past few weeks, so i went off and asked her what was really up and we got into a huge argument. she then ignored me for days without an answer as to why she was acting this way. 

i went out with our mutual friend, brittany, the day after, and brittany was surprised to know that i had no idea what was going on for the past few weeks. brittany told me that our other friend, sarah, and amanda are now best friends and tell each other everything. including some problems that me and amanda both had with sarah that i had intended to bring up with sarah personally when they happened. 

back in the spring of last year, sarah would talk behind our backs/not tell us things that were going on. one of those things being something really direct and personally harmful to me. i was fed up. i put in the notes app of my phone the things she had done recently that pissed me and amanda off, and i wanted to meet with her about those things and see if we could actually get anything resolved instead of harboring these pissed off feelings behind sarah's back. however, each time we would try to make the plans, something would happen and me and amanda just figured it was a sign and we should let it g"

I even scared a bitch off.

I looked at it and saw he was making fun of how I look... editing in things to make me look like an idiot. I went off on him and eventually because of that everyone in the chat did. The whole time he was defending it but I feel guilty for turning the chat against him. But on the other side I wanted to keep my face unknown... Am I the asshole?

For the past few years, my friend Bob and I have been working to help him through his issues.  You see, Victor also has a lot of unchecked anger, and he won't confront it.  He complains about his anger issues and the like, but he won't take any advice on how to fix it.  My friend Bob and I have both experienced depression as well, and we often try to help Victor with a few bad habits that can make it worse (like poor sleeping, eating habits, and overloading himself work-wise).  We're coming from a place of concern, and we try to bring these things up gently, but it's yielding no results.

I know that as his friend, and a fellow teenager, my advice may not be the best, but he completely blows me off.  I try to research before I tell him anything at all.  So, am I the asshole for wanting him to change?"
6ysshh,,"I'm sorry for any errors and confusion on stuff as I'm on mobile. 

To get the ball rolling, I'm fifteen (so I can't go anywhere) and I am at school from 8 AM to 3:06 (odd time I know). I walk home so it takes anywhere from ten (if I'm hauling ass for whatever reason) to twenty minutes (If I'm seriously dragging my feet) to get home. The first thing I do when I get home is play my guitar for about ten minutes until my older sister comes home from work. 
She then will start bitching to me about some irrelevant bullshit for another hour and a half (while I'm trying to do homework) before my dad comes home. Then I get lectured on why I'm a lazy degenerate for not doing something even though I have been doing homework except for the first ten minutes. Within a few minutes of my dad coming home, my mom comes home and then she starts arguing with my dad or my sister over some more irrelevant things. While these arguments are taking place I try to get in a few more minutes of practice instead of being caught in the middle of some bullshit argument. 
Every time I turn on the amp (a shitty little 25 watt amp that never usually goes above four on the master volume) it's always ""I have a migraine"" or ""Can you play it later?"" To which I usually turn it off, but lately it's been getting on my nerves as it happens every fucking time, so I call them out on their bullshit (respectfully).
I tolerate the countless hours of them arguing, my older sister loudly watching shit on YouTube at 3AM (I have insomnia and the sleeping pills usually kick in around 1 or 2 AM) my dad blasting the fucking radio from 4 to 5 AM, and my mom's irrelevant story about her day (even though I never asked how her day went). Is it fair for them to at least tolerate (at most) a fucking half hour of my guitar playing, or am I being unreasonable?"
6yuper,,"I moved into a new shared apartment a few days ago. There are four people in total me, another guy and two girls, everyone has their own room. Because I moved recently, I don't know any of them very well.

My friend needs a place to stay for the night. Unfortunately, I'm at work until 3am. So it's going to be a bit tricky to let her stay there. I thought of three options for how to do it.

1. She'll stay somewhere in the city centre, we'll meet after work and go to my place together. This option is not that good for my friend because she has to get up early.

2. She'll come before I go to work, stay in the apartment and I'll return from work in the middle of the night. She'll have to be in the apartment the whole time, as I'll need to take the keys so I can get back. Also from the roommates' point of view, there'll be a strange girl in my room.

3. I can just give her the keys, this would work best for her. But I don't know if I'd be OK with any of my roommates giving keys to a stranger, so I thing this might be disrespectful to them.

I have already let my roommates know she'll be staying over.

Which of these options makes me an asshole the least, regarding my roommates?"
6yvf2g,,"(I'm on mobile and this is my first post so sorry for any screw ups) 

My younger sister (17) brought a kitten home at the beginning of May, and my parents weren't big fans of it. So I was home from university, and basically raised the cat while she was at school. When summer came around, she got a job at a summer camp, and was gone Sunday-Friday every week. I took care of the cat then as well. At the end of summer, my dad told me he wanted the cat out of the house. So when I left I told her I was taking him multiple times, and she always blew it off as a joke. Now the cat is living in my apartment and she's telling me that she hates me and never wants to speak again. "
6yvw3u,,"Without getting into too many details a brief backstory. He owes me close to 10k dollars, all of which I got through student loans. Started with big loans and then small loans one after the other every time he went over his budget. He has a history of delayed pay-backs but I thought with me it would be different. After a while I kept discussing our money problems calmly but a few months ago I snapped and had an angrier conversation. Since then he has been a little more hesitant about asking me for anything at all really. 


Lately he started asking again and at least he started paying back the new loans fairly quickly, but I really don't want to be his personal bank. He keeps guilting me into paying saying we need food (we live together) and other supplies, while he hasn't had a consistent job in forever and does 0 budgeting. He just spends and spends and then comes to me when he has nothing left again. He acts like a millionaire when he has money... The kind that likes to show off how much he spent too. 


Meanwhile I'm still only getting student loans and all this loaning has really affected me negatively over the years. Like more than you can imagine. Both academically and mentally. I can get really angry when I think about how much he owes me and especially why... I get even angrier when in his eyes I'm probably being greedy or acting like a terrible son because I bring this shit up.


 Today he asked a small amount for food again and as soon as he heard I was hesitant to say yes he just hung up like my little sister would: ""yeah ok whatever"". Like, really? If I was rich I'd buy you guys anything, but I'm giving you my loans here. I've already given plenty. This has to stop somewhere. I'm trying to help you with budgeting and I really cut down my own expenses too. On top of that he makes me feel selfish. Well if this is what being a selfish asshole is like I'm going to start doing it more. I *need* to be more selfish. Am I wrong?"
6z5een,,"Throwaway account because ex is a redditor. Also not really looking for relationship advice or anything like that.

So my ex that I dated for about 2 years. We were fairly off and on during those 2 years, argued a lot, communication was a pretty big downfall of ours. We both have fiery tempers and while we never said anything particularly rude and definitely never did any physical harm, I always felt we were both too quick to just break it off over an argument. Our ""breakups"" usually lasted long enough for us to cool off, maybe about a week at most. 

I know, it was unhealthy.

Anyway, last summer we had a really bad break up. Since then things have been tense between us most of the time, with a few glimmering moments of friendship. He was there for me when my dad passed away suddenly a few months ago and from that time, he and I had been in contact more often than we had been before. Little by little, it got to talking about mundane subjects every day, he'd tell me about his son, he'd ask how my day at work was, I'd ask how his work was going...that sort of thing. It eventually progressed to light flirting. 

We weren't getting back together or anything but I thought we would at least get to be friends again. We were talking every day, all day and all night mostly. 

A few weekends ago, I happened to be up in the city he lives in and he did me a favor so I ended up seeing him for the first time in a year. We ended up sitting in his truck and talking and the whole time he was acting very flirty, putting his arm around me, holding my hands and eventually kissed me. I should have put a stop to it but let's be honest, I still like the guy and I enjoyed kissing him.

The few days after were fine, we didn't see each other anymore but both of us were fairly busy so I didn't think much of it. The talking stayed the same. In the week or so after however, he started showing signs of ghosting me. I called him on it, one, because I knew him better than to think he's just do th"

So last night my grandfather found out that some music artist from when he was young had died and to honor them decided to play one of their albums, I have no problem with any of this except for the fact that they decided to play it at full volume at 10:30pm. My bedroom is right next to theirs and after about ten minutes of trying to sleep through it, I got up and knocked on their door and when my grandfather answered said, ""Hey, sorry to bother you, but could you please turn it down just a bit?"" He got in a bit of a huff say yes and go to sleep and turned the music off. The next morning he said I needed to apologize to him and my grandmother for being so rude and arrogant and how it was disrespectful to knock on their door and tell them to do things. I apologized because what else could I do and he said, ""You don't get it do you?"" And proceeded to storm off in a huff. I didn't know that it was because somebody died, I didn't tell them turn it off and when it is so loud that you have to leave the room to hear me ask to turn it down, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to turn it down.

I'm trying to get my mind off things and play some Zelda. I'm alone, actually enjoying this nightmare for a moment. Then everyone else comes in. Of course for the millionth time the rugrat tunnel visions on the TV and heads for the dock. Shit kept making me nervous, kid kept climbing the entertainment center trying to grab the dock. The mom kept pulling him away and saying ""No, don't touch that. You'll play it in a little bit."" I'm super uncomfortable. I hate the kid, but I can't hate him because I love my cousins. I try to just deal with it but I can't. My anxiety, irritation, and awkwardness is up. So I just pop it off the dock and leave the room after the mom said he could play. I never planned to put any part of my electric baby into the hands of their human one. As I was walking out she said ""We can just play a game on my phone"" which made me feel like an asshole but at the same time I feel like she shouldn't volunteer other people's expensive prized possessions to be a child's chew toy. I'm pretty torn. I feel like most people would be like ""Yeah here, play some Nintendo with me"" but I just don't trust or like this toddler that I have never even seen before yesterday."
6zah5o,,"Key word is on acting.

I'm extremely introverted, I hate people. I hate social interaction. But when I'm forced into a situation where I have to be social, I'm very good at acting.

Now when I'm with my girlfriend I'm no recluse, but I'm real. I enjoy talking to her and I feel open with her, but after almost 3 years together there's really not much to talk about. We know pretty much everything about each other and can pretty much just know what the other is thinking. I'm not a recluse with her, I'm just much more quiet and communicate more physically (I'm constantly hugging and kissing her and generally giving her affection which she loves) than verbally. Simply because there's not really much to say other than how our days were and the 2-3 interesting things we find out that day. I can stretch but there's really not much to talk about and I do feel like all the pressure is on me to make interesting conversation beyond the mundane ""hey look there's an x over there""

Either way she usually gets pretty upset when she sees me in a situation where I'm acting social. I'm up front with her and tell her ""yeah I'm basically performing here"" and she still gets pretty upset. I don't really see how she can justify getting mad at me over it when most of these times she's the one forcing me into these social situations that I act friendly in. She fully knows I'd rather be at home cuddling with her but she still acts somewhat jealous at me more or less pretending to be social and friendly with her friends or our respective parents.

I mean she gets the real me and to some degree I'm faking with them. I straight up ask her if she wants me to pretend and she doesn't answer me. I try my best to comfort her but she always ends up jealous and angry at me over it and we have the exact same fight every time. "
6zc2lk,,"So lately I've been trying to seperate from a ""friend"" he acts very narcissistic, he is a pathological liar etc. He's done things where I just cannot tolerate him anymore. Anyways, we were part of the same social group and this weekend he planned a party for Sunday with the group, I did Saturday. I didn't tell him of mine, however, he had to cancel his so he made his early Saturday which is totally fine. 

The group got confused because for them they wondered if we decided to make it the SAME event because they didn't know I was like trying to distance myself from this guy. But it ended up being where he had a little get together then everyone went to mine yet I told him he cannot show up at my house, I told him why I'm mad at him and like if he doesn't want to change or even consider what he did was wrong then there won't be next time, but I told him do NOT show up at my house. 

He tried getting my other friend to drive him, because this other friend called me asking what he should say to my friend because he had a full car. So, I told him like, ""no don't drive him"". 

So, 6pm arrives and people show up...so does this ""friend"" who I specifically said do NOT show up at my house because you're not invited. And as two people were walking in(mutual friends) I had to tell him he has to leave, and he cannot come in. I felt like an asshole especially because the girls who saw KNEW us two and everyone assumed we're close so for them it's like WTF is between them? Most didn't care thank god but I really didn't want drama at my party and I know if he was there he's the type to make sure all the attention is on him fully. He looked super sad when I said no but knowing him he won't learn unless you give consequences.


So...am I the asshole? I told him before hand he cannot come, I even made my get together secret so he wouldn't find out yet he did, but he showed up at my house anyways, and I told him to leave. Worst part is we've been friends for few years so yea it'd suck t"
6zcgtj,,"I live in a neighborhood that just set up a HOA in late 2016, When I bought the land there was no HOA in place and nothing on the deed saying one was coming. We are one of 3 other houses out of 25 that are not part, all on the outer edge of the neighborhood tucked in the woods.


To be fair, we were the first three houses here, the land in the back of us was fields that were converted in the last 17 years and just finished late in 2016. Compared to the rest of the neighborhood we have 4 acres while they all only have maybe half at best for property size and we are all in the woods with a grass field and playground separates us from them, our three houses are also custom built whereas the rest are from the same builder.
I am the corner lot so I share a small sliver of land with asshole HOA president who thinks since I touch his yard I am sucked into HOA rules and regulations.
My two neighbors and I like I said have about 12 acres between the three of us and do not have any fences between us and routinely will walk through our woods with dogs or kids to explore and just be outside. My neighbor has a tree house fort with ropes, bridges and swings between a few trees and since the HOA started up he has gotten warnings from Asshole HOA president to remove said tree house fort or face fines.
Now since my yard touched his yard HOA president thought he could bully me to get my neighbor to listen and would trespass on my property and got as ballsy as knocking on my back sliding door on my deck 15 feet off the ground.
I answered with my shotgun in hands and he backed up acting like we were old friends and told him he had 30 seconds to get back to his yard or i'd start shooting.

6zcj33,,"(Backstory): A good friend of mine introduced me to some of his friends about 6 months back. We all chat through a popular chat service, since we mostly live apart from each other. The main chatroom is used for talking and sharing links and stuff, and occasional political debate. My friend and I are both Authoritarian Rights, and there are a lot of other people on other sides of the political compass. There is also a lot of in-fighting, with gossip and insulting people behind their backs. I like almost everyone at first, unless they come out as a complete asshole, so I automatically thought everyone there was decent, and defended them if things got too rough. I never ratted anyone out, however.    


&amp;nbsp;


(Real Story): A couple of people on the chatroom were saying things like ""taxation is theft"" and other things. I joined in the conversation, with my usual banter. Things were pretty civil, and I learned a few things from them. This goes on for a couple weeks to a month, and they seem a little annoyed, so I stop, even though they continue to talk about politics. This made me a little mad, but it didn't stop me from participating in the chat. I didn't debate, but I continued to post memes and stuff, some of which were political, but nothing insulting.


&amp;nbsp;


Then, a couple hours ago, I get back from vacation and notice that I can't find the chatroom anywhere. I talked to my good friend, who I know personally, and he says I was kicked. His side of the story is that everyone else ""didn't like it when I talked politics and that I complained when I lose."" This is one of my best friends, and I'm sure he was against it, but he just let it happen! I also talked to a couple of the guys I was cool with, and they said the same thing. So, am I the asshole for debating too much?"
6zczgb,,"The other night, my friend drunkenly took a bike sitting by someone's apartment unlocked. 

Today, I told him that he should return it and it wasn't right to steal someone's bike like that, especially considering it was a nice bike

Another friend said ""dude chill the fuck out. You're not his dad. He can do what he wants""

My friend still returned the bike, but I think that my friend getting mad at me was unjustified. I've always been known as the type of people that doesn't compromise in my beliefs, and sometimes that rubs people the wrong way. But in this case I don't feel I did anything wrong. "
6zemdd,,"So, disclaimer, this was written on my phone so beware of mistakes.

Anyway, the story started about a week ago, when I wanted to buy a pair of Nike flyknit racers (really nice shoes that I've wanted for a while) and I see a seller selling plenty of them for the original price (110 dollars), so I think ""what the hell!"" And buy the pair I want.

Fast forward to today and I receive the shoes, and quickly find out they are fake. I contact the seller and he immediately confesses and offers to send some money in return, but I get to keep the shoes.
I say ""yes, 65 dollars"" and he agrees and sends the money over PayPal. I then take a closer look at the shoes and think to myself, wow these look like crap, and then I get an idea, why not scam the scammer! 
So I first open PayPal and send the money to my bank account so the funds are safe, then I call eBay and tell them that I was sent a fake pair, then they start the return process for the full price + shipping.

The seller is panicking at this point and keeps telling me that he will return all the money if I send them back, but I now have the potential to make a sweet 65 FROM A SCAMMER, so I'm planning on staying cold and going through with the process.

My question is, am I the asshole for scamming a guy who tried to scam me?

Also, any advice with eBay or PayPal to the this?"
6zjbl9,,"This happened:

I cleaned out the fridge today because it just needed to be emptied of old stuff. For a few weeks now people have been noted something smells rotten in there. Nevertheless, we had not been able to find it.

Lo and behold, today I find the tiniest, most nondescript tupperware of raw meat in there. I turn to the folks in the living room and say ""I think I found what's been stinking the place up.""


After some exchange of words, my stepfather, Bob, ultimately comes to the conclusion that it is my mother's fault--as she had some time ago cleaned the fridge and failed to find it. Stepfather Bob notes that he himself had noticed this small tupperware previously in the fridge--but he did nothing about it.


I was not trying to blame anyone, but I casually mention that we all screwed up in not finding it earlier, basically saying nobody is really to blame because we all failed to find it. But Stepfather Bob persists it's my mother's fault that the fridge smelled because she had cleaned the fridge and not found it. I'm steadfast in that it's nobody's fault in particular. But in slightly joking response, I note that at least we had cleaned the fridge before, whereas he had not even attempted to clean the fridge. I figure it's worth at least some credit that she cleaned the fridge previously trying to find the tupperware whereas he complained about the smell and still did nothing about it. He disagrees.


Despite this, he repeats having noted the tupperware before, and I question why, if he was troubled by the smell, and he noted something odd about this particular tupperware, he nevertheless did nothing about it. Simply put, the tupperware was somewhere on his radar and he did nothing, whereas at least my mother and I made efforts to clean the tupperware, and it eventually turned up when I cleaned the fridge.


He bolsters his argument by analogizing: if I pay a car mechanic to do a particular job, and the mechanic does something different, it's the mechanic's"
6zkatq,,"Will spare y'all a history of family drama but I really would appreciate an objective opinion on this. I am the oldest of three. My middle sister, who is three and a half years younger announced her engagement. Her and I have had a pretty tumultuous relationship to say the least, and about 7 years ago we mutually decided to cut one another out of each other's lives completely. She's the first one of us to get married and I know it'd break my parents' heart if not all of their children were there for that moment but I really, truly, never want to see her again. And I know she feels the same way. This is a decision I have thought a lot about and I feel strongly that I would not regret it. But I know at the end of the day I am depriving my parents this family/Kodak moment because I don't want to see her again. I just feel as though I have the right to be selfish in this instance. I'm the asshole, right?"
6zmqmm,,"So I finally got my dad to throw away a lot of old furniture that is either broke, outdated or just taking up space. there was a fair bit of stuff to throw away and so I hired a skip to dispose of this waste. 

Now for my neighbor, he has had old rubbish, furniture and a whole list of waste which he was wanted to get rid of for about a year now. he leaves it there in his garden and it has piled up, now to the point where he has nowhere left to put it. 

So there I was today, putting all the rubbish into my skip, when he he asks if he can put his rubbish in my skip. 
Just to reiterate, there is enough stuff in his garden that it wouldn't fit in 2 trucks. A LOT of shit. 
I say I don't think there will be room because there is a lot of furniture to go in the skip and he responds saying ""but they don't charge by weight for the skip"" (which is true). I then simply told him no because I felt he was holding on to his shit, just to dump it in someone else skip to save a few quid. He gave me a look and walked away muttering something, and so I continued. 

When I was finished, the skip was reasonably full, but on the lower end. There was definitely room for more stuff, but not his entire collection. Maybe a quarter. I said nothing and the skip was collected today. 

Was I the asshole for not letting him put his stuff in the skip, since it wouldn't have charged me any more? "
6znry1,,"I don't mean at all to phrase the title sarcastically or like I'm the good guy or anything. My roommate will ask me to do various things around the house like clean or do dishes or laundry. She's a bit on the lazy side, so more often than not it's me who ends up doing these things, but I don't have a problem with it because I don't have a job and I feel a sense of responsibility to help her out as much as possible when I can. 

The problem is sometimes I'll forget a step and make a mistake with what she wants me to do, because I didn't hear her or I forgot or whatever, which will prompt her to start yelling at me that I never listen and that she doesn't matter to me etc. And she'll inevitably ask ""honestly do you think I'm asking you to do too much? Because I know I'm lazy. You can tell me"".  To which I always respond no it's no trouble. 

So the other day we're having this conversation again, and I say ""you do kinda ask me to do more than our other roommates do, but I don't say anything because I want to make your life easier"". She storms off from the conversation and later I overhear her crying to our other roommate about how I'm a liar and she can't trust anything I tell her. Am I the asshole? And is there anything I can do to make this whole situation better?"
6zsnbf,,"I'm gonna keep it brief because I'm tired. I've got a post in /r/relationships you can read if you want a lot of detail but it's not all pertinent.

My bf and I have moviepass, a $10/month subscription that allows you to see one movie a day. It's not free but it's super cheap. He offered to let a friend and the friend's daughter use mine and his to go see a movie.  These people are poor and homeless, but the guy has a job. He didn't ask me if this was ok. I've got issues with people using my stuff or volunteering my stuff without asking, I find it disrespectful. But instead of articulating this like a person who is quick on their feet, I said that I work hard for stuff like this, if they want moviepass they can afford it themselves, it's cheap. I was definitely an asshole at that moment.

If I had been asked in advance if they could use it, I'd have said yes. I need to be asked because I do work hard for everything I have, not respecting that really upsets me. Bf, on the other hand, gives people money and offers to help with things so much that his friends joke about it. And he's not exactly rich. 

So he's now called the things I said cold, ugly, and horrible. He thinks this is serious enough to break up over and idk what the fuck to do. Am I the asshole?

Edit: There seems to be some confusion so I'll clear it up. I have a moviepass in my name that I pay for, and he has one in his name he pays for. It is not a shared thing."
6zt1sh,,"Some background info; I'm 18, &amp; so is everyone else in this story. 

To make a loooong long story short; I was close friends with a group of friends, but me &amp; Derek had our differences &amp; decided not to be friends anymore. 

Our friend group claimed to not pick sides &amp; I thought everything was fine until I realized they were intentionally not inviting me places, ignoring me, &amp; (most likely) talking behind my back, among other things. I decided to brush most of this off because as long as I ignored Derek, everyone acted fine &amp; I could deal with it, until around two weeks ago. Everyone in the group started acting very outwardly different, &amp; treating me pretty bad. I got really fed up &amp; decided it was time to just cut ties, bc I have a lot going on &amp; I don't have time to be dealing with petty drama like this. 

Things were pretty whatever, until someone from the groups birthday came around. I had bought her a birthday present before she started treating me really bad, but the way she was treating me the days leading up to her birthday made me doubt if I should give it to her or not. It's now been a few days since her birthday, and I still don't know if I should bother giving her the present or not. I don't want to like, reward her bad behavior, but I also don't want to become the asshole by not giving her the gift. 

TL;DR friends ditch me to be friends with someone else/over petty drama &amp; start treating me really poorly. someones birthday comes up &amp; I don't know if I'm the asshole for not giving her a present for her birthday. "
