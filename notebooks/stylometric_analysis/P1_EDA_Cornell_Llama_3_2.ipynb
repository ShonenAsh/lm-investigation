As mentioned on your post, I'm an easy-going guy with interests ranging from weightlifting and sports nutrition to evolutionary biology (primates are my jam).\\n\\nI've been looking around Ithaca for some affordable and comfortable options, and I'd love to find someone who shares similar values and preferences. No judgments here! If you're a current grad student or have experience with finding housing, any tips would be appreciated.\\n\\nHere are the basics:\\n\\n* Age: 29\\n* Sex: Not particular, open to anyone\\n* Interests: Weightlifting, sports nutrition, evolutionary biology (especially human/primates), video games (occasionally)\\n* Family life: Single and unmarried, no kids planned\\n* Pets: No allergies, happy to have some furry friends in the mix\\n\\nAs for housing, I'm looking for something reasonably close to campus, but not too far. With a grad stipend, price is definitely a consideration. If you know of any affordable options or can recommend someone who's looking for a roommate, hit me up!\\n\\nLooking forward to hearing from like-minded folks in the Cornell community!\",\n          \"Hey fellow 'Cats! I've got the info for you.\\n\\nAs far as I know, Noyes does have a track, but it's not entirely indoors. The upper portion of the track is covered with a roof, but there are still some sections that aren't enclosed. Not exactly ideal for casual use, but if you're looking to get in a workout, it'll do.\\n\\nThat being said, I did find out about a spot on campus that might fit your bill: the Goldstein Fitness Center! They have an indoor track that's open 24/7, and it's not just limited to Goldstein members. You can just walk in and sign in using your Cornell ID. The hours are usually pretty flexible, but I'd recommend checking their website or hitting up the fitness center to confirm.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that there might be some limitations on usage (e.g., no high-impact exercises) depending on the time of day and other factors.\\n\\nHope that helps!\",\n          \"**r/Cornell user here**\\n\\nHey there, fellow future MBA hopeful!\\n\\n Congrats on taking the first step towards applying to Cornell Johnson - it's not easy, but you're making great progress despite the distance. I totally get what you mean about not being able to attend events in Taiwan or the UK. Reddit can be a great platform for connecting with the community, and I'm happy to help.\\n\\nTo answer your questions:\\n\\n**What do you like about Cornell in general?**\\nFor me, it's all about the **broad academic excellence** and **research opportunities**. The Johnson School has an incredible reputation for producing successful leaders who are passionate about social impact. I've been impressed by the school's commitment to fostering a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and community engagement.\\n\\nI also appreciate Cornell's **small class sizes**, which allow for more personalized attention and mentorship. Plus, the university is located in one of the most beautiful cities in the world - Ithaca, NY!\\n\\n**What don't you like very much about Cornell?**\\nHonestly, some people might find the **admissions process** to be a bit grueling. It's a highly competitive environment, and you'll need to demonstrate exceptional fit with the school's values and mission.\\n\\nAlso, while it's not a con per se, I think some students might struggle with the **location** (more on that below).\\n\\nAs for things we do in Cornell... Well, we have our fair share of activities, from case competitions to social impact projects. Some people are part of student organizations focused on sustainability, entrepreneurship, or community development.\\n\\nOne thing I love about Cornell is its **diverse and inclusive community**. We've got students from all over the world, with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. It's a great environment for learning, networking, and growing as a leader.\\n\\nRegarding your essay, don't worry too much about not having direct experience with specific events or activities. The Creating Impact essay is an opportunity to showcase your passions, values, and goals. We're looking for stories that demonstrate your commitment to making a positive impact in the world.\\n\\nTake it from me: even without attending Cornell events in person, you can still connect with the community on Reddit (and other platforms). We're here to support each other!\\n\\nFeel free to ask more questions or share your own experiences. I'm happy to chat!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"human_resp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1801,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Greetings, I will be an freshman in the college of engineering next year. I was wondering how hard it is to manage your time. I heard that you won't see the day of light. Is this true? Thanks in advance. I was an engineer at Cornell over a decade ago. I majored in EE and did the Meng afterwards. I had no trouble balancing school with social life. I was even in a fraternity and graduated with a GPA of 3.5. Time management, tolerate failure, you'll be fine. 11, 8 Pretty easy, actually. Managing your time well is largely dependent on determining how well you want to do in classes vs. how much of a social life you want. If you want to graduate with straight As, you'll probably have less of a social life than someone who is okay with graduating with straight Bs. I have a 3.5 right now, and I'm a sophomore in about six clubs who works 10 hours a week in a research lab. Generally, I have 1-2 hours of free time (outside of class, research, and my clubs) a day for Netflix/reading/whatever. It is what you make of it.  Graduated from AEP in '12 with a 3.4, it's really not that bad. There'll be nights when you'll have to skip a party to do a problem set, but for the most part, you'll have plenty of time for coursework+hobbies+socializing. Depends on your course load, ability, efficiency/organization, and goals. Definitely manageable though. Keeping a calendar/planner is very helpful.  You seem very intelligent.  I'm not being sarcastic. There are definitely a lot of ways to plan out a great schedule with backups if needed. I'm an undeclared Freshman hoping to study ECE and I think that saying that we don't see the light of day is a bit of an exaggeration. Of course there are times where I have to choose doing work over hanging out but I have plenty of time to hang out afterwards. I'm not doing a lot of networking as I want to solidify a good GPA and develop skills I need to be successful in Internships and Jobs but I know that that opportunity will present itself in time. You'll be fine, trust me.\\n\\n(One last thing. Engineering is *different* just like how every other school is *different*. CALS students will have hard times in their school and so will Hotelies, Engineers, Arts, etc. Everybody I know works just as hard (harder sometimes) in their respective schools as I do in Engineering. I don't think there's anything special about Engineering that makes it tougher than any other school here. Some people like to think that they have it harder because they're an Engineer. Don't be one of those that thinks that. Everyone has their own struggles. All of that being said, welcome to Big Red!) As a freshman in engineering (planning to study ECE) it's totally doable with a bit of time management. I'm currently the only undergrad in an awesome research group of PhD/MEng students. I also participate in an organization that is draining (in a good way) and consumes hundreds of hours every semester, and I still have time to relax with friends and go out. I currently have a 3.1 but hopefully that will increase as I take more higher level courses. \",\n          \"The guy was pretty awful, but I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and check out some of his other stuff. All I remember from his introduction was that he works at Comedy Central, if anyone remembers his name lmk Nobody remembers his name because 60% of the audience was still outside waiting to get in when he was done.\\n\",\n          \"I've been searching for places to live for about 2 weeks now. It's tougher for me, since I need to find a place that will allow me to bring my Doberman/German Shepherd mix pup. (Stupid places and their insurance policies on \\\"aggressive\\\" dog breeds...) Anyhow, I have a feeling that the bulk of the places have been renting out for next year already? Am I correct? I see a couple places that I could bear with, but rather not, due to reasons like it doesn't have a fenced yard or it is further from campus than I'd like. Should I just sign for something that I can bear with soon, or keep holding out to try and find something that I actually like? And when is the latest I should sign by?  A majority of students have signed their leases for the 15-16 school year in the fall, so you are starting out pretty far behind in the game.  I suppose don't sign anything rashly, but I wouldn't bank on holding out for anything, because that likely won't be as fruitful as you'd like.  Best of luck though! Yea you're a little late. But check out Boiceville Cottages if you have a dog. There's a small dog park, no pet deposit/rent You're not too late.  Grad students typically don't enroll until March / April, which is much later than when undergrads sign leases.  I started hunting for apartments in June and found one I love (and have been in for almost 3 years now).  Many of my classmates moved after their first year. Hi. Are you a vet student? I just got accepted, so I'm now in the same boat of trying to figure out where I'm going to live.  Where did you look? Craigslist generally? [deleted] Yes, I used craigslist.  I knew I wanted to live far from campus, which is maybe why I had an easier time. Did you live alone? There doesn't seem to be a shortage of housing on craigslist, but there seems to be a huge shortage of people looking to find roommates haha. Did your program help set you up with other incoming students? [deleted] Yes, I do live alone.  My program didn't help us find housing, but we were given contact information of all the other incoming students in our class (16 I think).  Someone made a facebook group page for us, and I think one or two people may have asked if anyone wants to be roommates.  \\n \\nAs I said, I think a lot of students in my class moved after their first year.  After being in the area for a few months it becomes much easier to find places. Unfortunately I'm only in Ithaca for 9 months haha, so my first time finding a place will probably be my last too. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
