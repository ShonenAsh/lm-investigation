Basic overview of files in here:

(I used AI to make the 1 time use generation scripts, there is a lot of uncessecarry logging information as a result)

AITAposts.csv contains the original post title and text as well as the conversation ID of the post

AITAresponses.csv contains all human responses that are direct comments under the original post, including the conversationID and response text

AITA_ai_smalldataset.csv contains 50 convIDs with all of the human responses included plus 1 additional response generated by Gemma3 4B and another generated by Dolphin-Mistral

For python scripts:

(all of this code needs edits and refactors to work properly in the current folder architecture)

create_human_dataset.py downloads the Am I The Asshole subreddit data from convokit and makes a csv for original post titles and original post text and a csv for the human responses to that text.

augment_with_ai.py generates AI responses based on human parameters using locally hosted AI with Ollama: currently set to 50 posts to respond to and 1 response per model architecture per post.

filter_human_responses.py makes sure that the ai-augmented dataset only contains human post responses that the AI-generation actually responded to
