4czypu,"you're not the asshole. 

business is business, and if she can't keep her product consistent and/or her customers happy, maybe getting reported will be the kick in the butt she needs to get her crap together. 

can you imagine trying to return a shirt in a fancy boutique store and them saying ""yeah, come back later and i'll let you know if we'll exchange it then."" people would throw em under the yelp bus once they got home. ",Human
4czypu,"Not an asshole. You're right to take it to etsy while there's still time, she might be purposefully trying to stall you. ",Human
4czypu,That's what my gut is telling me. It isn't hard to look at a picture of a ripped sweatshirt and offer a refund/replacement.,Human
4czypu,"Not the asshole. As a seller, you have to know how to deal with this kind of situation before it even comes around. Part of the good thing about Etsy is the personal touch between vendor and buyer. This seller is stomping all over that spirit.

Not giving you a straight answer is a childish move. It also makes me wonder if she might have known about the hole and tried to sell it anyway.",Human
4czypu,No for the Etsy thing. Yes for all this silly second guessing crap.,Human
4czypu,"Retail 101: make customer happy. 

You're not the asshole ",Human
4czypu,You are definitely not the asshole and 100% right to bring it to the attention of Etsy.,Human
4czypu,The asshole is the one stalling the process to escape accountability,Human
4czypu,"This. Also the seller more or less straight lied to you, saying they would get back to you monday.",Human
4czypu,You're not the asshole at all. You made her aware there was a problem and she didn't fix it. That's exactly why Etsy has a process for this and you're completely justified in using it.,Human
4czypu,"In no way could I see you possibly being an asshole. 

As others had mentioned, business is business. She wasn't professional, responsible nor even handled the situation in a honest way. It could be that she is new to the whole thing about being a seller or that she was trying to get in touch with her source, but that should not be your problem nor an excuse to the way a customer should be treated. 

The only thing I would mention to help you or anyone who find themselves in a similar predicament in the near future; Once a seller seem to be unable to handle your request for a refund or replacement for poor quality/ damaged goods in a satisfactory manner, tell them that you will launch a report or infraction against them. That usually scares them to submission and even throw in some 'goodwill' gifts.",Human

4d3evq,"You are not the asshole.
",Human
4d3evq,Thank you everybody for the replies. And all of you are right. And he still is not back yet. I'm thinking of reporting it but I don't want him to do something bad to it. So I have to just wait until he decides to bring it back. In one hour it will literally be two days.,Human
4d3evq,You absolutely should report it stolen and box his shit up and sit it on the curb. What a fucking loser asshole. Not you. You are not the asshole. This boy that you need to cut yourself free from is the asshole loser and no amount of explaining or excuses could make his behavior ok or in any way acceptable. Unless he is in the hospital unconcious.,Human
4d3evq,"Ya of course you are not the asshole. Couple hours late is rude, but 2 days? That's outright criminal. I would break up with someone who treated me like that.",Human
4d3evq,"If you report your car stolen, which it is by now, then you wouldn't be liable for damages, assuming you have insurance. ",Human
4d3evq,"Seriously, he did it even though he knew she had to get to work that day? That's some major disrespect. ",Human
4d3evq,You should never be afraid that your bf will do something bad to you or your things if you cross him. Your relationship keeps sounding more and more abusive. Report it stolen. Break up with him.,Human
4d3evq,He's a major asshole and it's in no way your own fault for lending him the car. Any decent person would've returned the car by the agreed upon time and you should be able tk expect your partner to be a decent person to you. Being an hour late can be a honest mistake; returning it the next morning would be a rude move; but keeping the car for two days is ridiculously assholish.,Human
4d3evq,"No. Fuck that guy. And to make myself clear, I mean that you should stop fucking that guy altogether, forever, and get your car back.  ",Human

4d3evq,"I'm also in the camp of reporting it stolen. Tell him ONE time he has be 3pm(or whatever) to return it, or you're filing a police report. Also have all his shit boxed up because seriously what are you doing with your life.",Human
4d3evq,"Absolutely not an asshole! And I'm also on the ""report it stole"" bandwagon. That's criminal.",Human
4d3evq,"Yes, but outside conformation may help her over the edge.",Human
4d3evq,"Hey, any updates?",Human
4d3evq,"Common manipulation technique. He may not be a bad guy- just seeing how much he can get away with. Set an expectation that he should not take you for granted. Do not lend him the car, and see how he responds. When there is a lack of consideration for the other person though, it is hard to build the foundation of a strong relationship.",Human
4d3evq,The fuck kind of person are you dating? Any update?,Human
4d3evq,"Update: he finally told me where the car was after 4 days. I did report it stolen. But since it was finally returned to me undamaged and with the key, I made it into a civil case instead of a criminal case. Which you would think he would be grateful. Instead he' s pissed that I reported it stolen. "" so you had to get a couple of rides"" he said. He had been talking to me via text for the first two days. Giving me very vague times of when it would be returned. But then the 3rd and 4 th day he was barely responding to my plethora of phone calls and texts. To the point of where he wouldn't respond at all or not tell me where he was or when he was bringing it back. So I reported it on the 3 rd day. He is also pissed that I was "" up his ass"" with calls and texts. Anyway in the end he's the asshole and I got my car back undamaged.",Human
4d3evq,He doesn't sound like someone who is interested in your happiness and well-being! Please consider cutting all contact! ,Human
4d4npn,How about sending yourself a reminder on tasker to text her every morning. Then send a real text not an automatic text. You get the automatic not her. If you do that then you are not the asshole.,Human
4d4npn,"I wouldn't say it's necessarily an asshole thing to do, but it's a bit dishonest. If I was the sort of girl who really liked getting good morning texts I would be happy specifically because my SO was thinking of me first thing in the morning and wanted to wish me well for the day. If he wasn't actually thinking of me in that moment I would feel kind of cheated. Your solution is fine if she never finds out about it, but I'd be willing to bet she would be hurt if she ever found out that you were doing it in such an impersonal way.  

Can you talk to her about your sleeping habits and arrange to just text her when you actually wake up? It's unreasonable of her to expect you to wake up unpleasantly early just to text her sweet nothings.  

Edit: regardless of your girlfriend, struggling with mornings is often an indication that you're not getting enough sleep or enough good quality sleep. You should read about sleep hygiene and see if there's anything you can change so that you can deal with mornings a bit better. Good luck!",Human
4d4npn,"She doesn't expect me to text her good morning at all, but she does like it. The ultimate goal is for me to get my sleeping habits under control, and then not need to have it text her automatically.

Thanks for the concern about sleeping hygiene. Reading about it, there's a ton that I can work on to improve my sleeping habits to help. Cheers!",Human
4d4npn,"That's a good idea. That's the end goal for me, to make it so I just need the prod to text her because I'll be waking up at decent hours. I like the idea.

I just had an idea; would setting it up to open up my SMS app as soon as I exit out of my alarm count as dishonest? What about if I included the pre-made messages, but didn't have it send automatically? ",Human
4d4npn,"You know your girlfriend better than we do. Ask yourself: if you would tell her, two weeks from now, ""those texts were a script because you like morning texts and I forget them"", how would you expect her to feel? Amused, thankful? Or insecure, disappointed, annoyed? If it's anything negative, then yeah, this is a bit of an asshole move.

I second the setting an alarm to remind yourself!",Human
4d4npn,You can type it in the box at night then hit send in the morning. ,Human
4d4npn,"You are definitely the asshole.  I understand you're on different schedules, so just don't text your girlfriend in the morning.  

She's going to find out, and you'll be in a world of hurt, rightfully so.

My ex worked 2nd shift, and I worked 8-5.  I never expected him to text me good morning.",Human
4d4npn,"Here's how to fix it. Instead of when you wake up, text her when you take your morning poop. Should still be around the time you wakeup ish right? ",Human
4d4npn,Case dismissed for lack of conflict or drama. ,Human
4d4npn,"Yes. It's dishonest and disingenuous. It's also something so stupid to fake. This seems more about the rouse that you keep a responsible adult lifestyle, but you know you don't. Anyone else you're lying to, besides your girlfriend and yourself?",Human
4d4npn,"For the sake of a judgement, I am going to say hesitantly that yes, you are being an asshole here.

Even if she demands for morning text, she wants it from you, not from some automated software. Sure, it might have been written sweetly and have different lines, but it is still dishonest and makes the whole point of greeting each other when you wake up kind of moot.

Get the tasker to prod you to send the actual text instead and tell her your sleeping habits in the case where you might not be able to send that text. As it is now, if she finds out about this, boy.. trouble awaits.",Human
4d4npn,As long as you aren't jerking off as the message is automatically sent I think you are not the asshole. ,Human
4d4npn,"It's a tough call.  Your intentions are good, but you're being dishonest in a way that might hurt her feelings if she discovered the truth.  My husband is a huge scatterbrain, too, and I can tell you from personal experience that one or two sincere texts from my man mean more because I know how he functions -- and they would mean a thousand times more to me than a daily text he auto-sent from a program.  Quality over quantity, man.  Not an asshole, but cut that tasker shit out.",Human
4d4npn,It's creepy to text someone good morning. ,Human
4d4npn,I honestly don't think you're an asshole for this! I would probably just be very very careful with it though! Like if she sleeps over or you sleep over and it still sends then that's kind of awk :P,Human
4d4npn,I think your intentions are good but this can only ultimately be seen as asshole behavior.  You are setting up a system to pretend to care enough to overcome your sleepy habits and send a text.  Read that again and explain to me how that's going to end well or be seen in a positive light by your GF. ,Human
4d4npn,"I think she would probably prefer if you typed it out, but I don't think it matters if you open the SMS app automatically.  ",Human
4d4npn,"I like convenience and I hate mornings so I applaud the ingenuity but scripting responses to loved one is a bit assholey, but so is demanding a daily and imho pretty needy morning greeting. Even fifty. ",Human
4d4npn,"This one is sort of tough for me to judge. You're doing this to be sweet to her, but it is a sort of ""cheat"" that you're using. I don't think I can say with certainty that this is morally wrong and you're the asshole, because you have good intentions, and I firmly believe morality lies in our intent. However, I can see how your girlfriend could say you're the asshole if she were to find out.

I've been known to sleep until noon and sometimes I don't respond to my boyfriend's good morning text until even later if I have a busy day. I don't function well in the morning, so my boyfriend doesn't *expect* much from me in the morning. My unsolicited advice for you is to *talk* with your girlfriend about your inability to function in the morning and for you both to adjust your expectations of each other. She should be able to know you love her if the first time you text her in the day is evening. Good morning texts are nice, but they aren't necessary. ",Human
4d4npn,"It's clingy. It says, ""Hey, I don't date much, so I'm going to be overly-affectionate in hopes you'll find it endearing."" Protip: They won't. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'd say you're not at all the asshole. She likes getting a text in the morning, you're giving her that.",Human
4d4npn,Yea I understand good morning texts sometimes. I had the same thought. It seems clingy to do each day and more genuine to do when you actually wake up and think about sending one.,Human
4d4npn,"&gt; spotty with my manual good morning texts, which hurts her.

Sounds like he came up with an asshole solution to a girlfriends insecurity problem. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'd advise you not to do it at all. Maybe if you're like, ""Good morning, want to go to breakfast?"" But don't send good-morning texts for the sake of texting. Texting is a crutch - use it sparingly. It shouldn't be used for conversations or used as a tool to convey affection. ",Human
4d4npn,Yea I agree with you. I guess you just conveyed the idea more correctly haha I was just saying every once in a blue moon it won't hurt and every morning is just weird ,Human
4d4npn,...excuse me while I google tasker. ,Human
4d4npn,"Honestly, if my husband did this, I'd find it kind of sweet. But then, I'm pretty low-key as far as communication needs go. But I don't think it's asshole behavior. I feel like everyone is making this out to be a way bigger deal than it really is.",Human
4d4npn,TIL: tasker not taser. Drastically changes if your the ass hole on not. ,Human
4d4npn,"I'm so glad I met my wife in 1999 before texting was a thing (although before her I did have a pager and a clingy girlfriend which had it's own set of issues).

Lest anyone accuse me of being old and out of touch, just last week I texted a dick pic to my wife.  That's then secret to keeping the romance alive. 8===D",Human
4d4npn,It's magnificent. So powerful. ,Human
4d4npn,"Ouch, I wasn't aware that I had to be 100% on top of adulting. Sorry I don't meet your standards, but believe it or not, most people aren't responsible adults. I'm trying though, and thought that automating the text might help keep up the illusion. ",Human
4d4npn,"Good point, to try and think about how she would react. I'm going to say she'd be disappointed. ",Human
4d4npn,"It doesn't sound like she's demanding them, so I agree with everything else you said and am gonna go with yeah, OP is the asshole here, even though his intentions are good.

If my boyfriend did this and I found out, I would be really upset. Not just mad, but like seriously disappointed and worried about other aspects of our relationship that I thought were genuine but might just be being half-assed. OP, I'd stop now and set an alarm to remind you to text her instead. That's still personal and shows that you're making an effort. ",Human
4d4npn,"I'll second this opinion.

I'm a girl who would appreciate a good morning text if my boyfriend woke up after me (he doesn't) and it would be because he was thoughtful enough to send me the message. I don't care if his phone reminded him to do it, since it's his idea to set that up in the first place.",Human
4d4npn,"Contrary to many opinions here, I don't think you're an asshole at all. If it's really important for your girlfriend to get that good morning message but it's something that is hard for you to do because of sleep schedules/whatever, I think you're actually really thoughtful to always make sure she gets her good morning, even if you're not personally writing out the message every day. Everyone has different relationship ""needs"" and if this is a tiny thing that she needs, you are providing it. Personally I don't care about this sort of stuff and my boyfriend is not a morning person at all so I wouldn't expect it, your post makes you seem thoughtful and caring about your partner which is the most important part.",Human
4d4npn,"To me it sounds like a chore - and chores that can be automated should. I don't know OP's girlfriend obviously, but it appears there would be major problems if he skipped the morning greetings for even a day. Would be funny if OP is sending them daily and she's only obliging *his* perceived neediness.",Human
4d4npn,"Too close to call. On one hand it's dishonest, on the other hand it's not really harming her.

However, I will say that this is probably going to backfire the first time she texts something like ""OMG Snuffles died"" (or whatever, if she doesn't have a pet, then her grandma or something else terrible) and then a few hours later gets ""Good morning beautiful xoxoxoxo."" Just saying.",Human
4d4npn,"Everyone sucks. How does she feel if she doesn't get a good morning text from you? Is it really that important? You both should be confident enough in your relationship, that missing a good morning text or two isn't going to kill you. If you're going through those lengths just to keep her happy, then you guys have other issues. ",Human
4d4npn,"From OP:
&gt; She doesn't expect me to text her good morning at all, but she does like it.


&gt;I know that good-morning texts are something that she likes, and I want to fulfil that

and 

&gt;the entire point of it is to make sure that she is as loved as she deserves (which is lots)

Saying that she **demands** the texts and then that it appears there would be **major problems** if he skipped them is contrary to everything OP has said. He's is just trying to be a good boyfriend!",Human
4d4npn,"I don't think you're an asshole. You clearly care about her knowing that you care and so setting up the system appears to be your way of making sure that happens. 

There may be better ways to do this (like amy colorado said about setting a reminder) but this definitely isn't assholish at all, your intentions are good, and your methods are (IMO) reasonable.",Human
4d4npn,whats the point if its the same text every time anyway? its nice in the beginning but becomes a forced sacrifice sooner or later without any inherit value. why not not include some sort of information? for example take something interesting out of your dream and turn it into a sentence. it also wakes you up better if you use your brain.,Human

4dcnuy,Maybe that's why she went into defensive mode by trying to guilt him into thinking he was related to her.

She's not only highly unprofessional by mixing up personal feelings and relationships with her work, she is violating all kinds of regulations by even giving another patient the chance to read random charts. They should be locked away whenever nobody is using them. I'm not from the US, but I know that this is true for pretty much every country in the developed world.

Normally, everyone who is present in the room should be introduced to the patient. I once did an internship before I was a med student, and the doctor who I followed around always told the patients ""this is notapantsday, he's doing an internship. Is it ok if he looks over my shoulder?"" and when some patients said they'd rather have some privacy, I left the room without a comment.

Inappropriate jokes are obviously not okay, but to be honest, they're just part of the job. I don't think anyone in the medical field has managed to avoid them. I usually just ignore them. If they're particularly bad, I tell the patient to watch their language but I never get angry at them.",Human

You can be friendly on a professional level. I sometimes joke with my patients and especially the older ones love a little compliment here and there. I don't think there's anything wrong with that as long as it doesn't become personal.

But smiling, giggling (basically flirting) and personal conversation is just beyond unprofessional in my opinion. You can talk about the weather or football, but never about your personal life (child) or your feelings.",Human

Wait wait wait. No. No that would not be fine. 

Just because someone is a doctor doesn't mean he can just go through your medical files. 

If he is a doctor that is involved in your treatment (that is, which you approved to be in your treatment) that's another story but a random doctor is literally no different from a random guy.

This dentist is violating doctor-patient confidentiality.

The website of the American Dental Association says the following in their Ethics section:

&gt;If it is necessary for a treating dentist to consult with another dentist or physician with respect to the patient, and the circumstances do not permit the patient to remain anonymous, the treating dentist should seek the permission of the patient prior to the release of data from the patient's records to the consulting practitioner.

I'm not from the US, I don't know who licenses dentists, but if I were you I would definitely find out and file a complaint.",Human

4diwg3,"The funny thing is that because 15% is considered the standard tipping amount, it is also seen as the bare minimum. The nature of a tip is to pay more than what is due, so a 15% tip is almost disregarded, and you need to tip more for it to actually count.",Human
4diwg3,"I usually tip 20% at a sit-down restaurant.  I don't tip a damn thing for take-out though.  You're not an asshole, but you may want to shift your tipping around a bit for maximum efficiency.",Human
4diwg3,Isn't that why they cost a couple hundred bucks?,Human
4diwg3,"To me tipping 15% is the minimum amount to not be a dick, so I say you're not the asshole.

Personally I tip 20% most always and tip 15% when I get below par service  ",Human
4diwg3,No. Seems right to me. Just don't tip so much at places that already pay more than server wages: it's unnecessary and rude of them to put their beggar cup out.,Human
4diwg3,15% is standard. Anything more indicates exceptional service.,Human
4diwg3,"Nah, 20% is ""great job""",Human
4diwg3,No that's not being an asshole. 15-25% is the standard for tipping. It's on the low side but by no means a dick move. ,Human
4diwg3,"Unwritten rules just don't work that well. I hate everything that has to do with tipping. The business owners should pay more/charge more so I don't have to try to figure out who gets a 401K match after I finish my dinner. I'm not saying I don't tip, it's just a fucked up system

Edit to confirm you're not the asshole",Human

4diwg3,"Not the asshole. I would tend to agree with your friends that something around 18% is sort of the new average (or maybe I just only hang out with overly generous people who knows) so you're definitely on the low end, but you're tipping an OK amount and that's not rude.",Human
4diwg3,You should tip for takeout.. Ever been a waiter? You tip out on sales percentage. And it sucks taking time from tables to get everything ready just to have less money because of it.. ,Human
4diwg3,"Once I had a group come in. They tipped 20$. It was nice, like a 25% tip. Next time, they came, I was excited especially because they went all out. 20$ still. Being like 10%.. x.x",Human
4diwg3,Its frustrating in other countries too. I usually ask the table next to me whats appropriate haha. ,Human
4diwg3,"I'm not sure how many people replying are Canadian. The 18 percent thing is a recent thing and is from the states, where they make something like a few bucks per hour wage (based on what I've seen on Reddit)

In Canada, as far as I'm aware, they still make minimum wage (plus the tips). 15 percent is completely fair",Human
4diwg3,I'm so glad I live in a country where tipping isn't a thing.,Human
4diwg3,"Canada here too, I always tip 10% and 15 if I feel like it. Wasn't it always 10%? When I moved to Alberta the default amount was 15 or 20 and I always put less because fuck that, greedy cunts. I never tip for takeout or at Chinese buffets because they don't do anything. ",Human
4diwg3,Why is the percentage going up??? Inflation causes the amount to go up anyways. I still only tip 10% and for bad service 5 cents on the table so they know I thought about the tip and didn't forget.,Human
4diwg3,That's my attitude to it as well. I'm not very needy so i tip based off of how much work I put the server through. I don't understand why I should pay more for the server to come by once and give me a steak and and beer while the table next to me over complicates a 5 dollar meal and has the server over every 5 minutes.,Human
4diwg3,Maybe my indifference is because I was a cook. ,Human
4diwg3,I can afford to have a car and an apartment thanks to getting tipped. I'm glad it is a thing here.,Human
4diwg3,"I couldn't tell you why, but I always tip 20% and sometimes more if service is great. If there's a problem I speak to a manager instead of leaving a crappy tip. Everyone I go out to eat with (including my parents) tips similarly to this.",Human
4diwg3,For some reason your words resonate with me.,Human
4diwg3,"Where I live you don't tip at all, maybe at really nice restaurants with great service or delivery drivers otherwise it just doesn't happen. The idea that hairdressers get tipped seems so weird to me.",Human

4diwg3,Yes. This ain't the 1950s,Human
4diwg3,Your grandma sounds like a cunt.,Human
4diwg3,I get minimum wage (7.05€). Tipping brings me about 300€ more a month. And you don't have to tip in the country where I live in.,Human
4diwg3,"The only thing I'd suggest tipping more on is if you get pizza delivery, depending on how far you live. If you were to get $15 of pizza delivered but you live ten minutes from the store, we'd prefer it if you tipped us more since we had to drive so far. But if you live pretty close, then it's nbd.",Human
4diwg3,"Okay so then you're being an asshole, but at least you're doing it on purpose. And presumably for valid reasons. 10% is low, but if you're a low-maintenance customer, and consistent, the servers can give you basic service and work on impressing the person who might tip more. I started tipping higher when my little family started being more work for the busboy, because I know they get a share. Same for hotel maids, who are really on the low end of the totem pole. ",Human
4diwg3,"I'm Dane, we don't tip here. Ecxept for our fedoras",Human
4diwg3,"It's a vicious cycle. 15% of the pre-tax total used to be the norm. Now it's the minimum, and it's based on the post-tax total. Some restaurants even have a little table saying what the 15%, 18%, 20 and sometimes 25%. Often I find these amounts mathematically inflated. This means waiters now expect a minimum of 25% on the pre-tax total. Every time the average tip is considered the new minimum tip, the expectation keeps increasing. Of course this means that restaurants want to get their money's worth from someone earning so much. So they add on bussing, cleaning and prep to the expected tasks. 

Last week I went to a restaurant, was kept waiting 30 mins for a table, and the waited 45 mins for my food. After that I still tipped the waitress 30%, because I didn't want her to get screwed over for an hour of her evening wasted by a badly run kitchen. Does that even make sense? 

I am glad more restaurants are moving to self-service, or being tip included. Because I NEVER feel I have gotten my money's worth from a tip. It always feels like charity or a shakedown.",Human
4diwg3,"you're right about being low maintenance, i usually know what i want when i order my drink and then eat and leave, all they do is bring the food and drink to me and that's it. if i'm at a bar running a tab and they keep bringing drinks and making changes to stuff for my liking then that deserves a better tip. but just to bring my food to me and nothing else? 10%. ",Human
4diwg3,"""You were horrible"" is 0% for me.  I've only had to do it once.",Human
4diwg3,"0% for me is ""We're done here"" and usually involves the manager. One waitress had the audacity to give me five ones back with my change. I asked for a glass of water three times and I'm still waiting for it. No, You're not getting a tip. Get my order right and don't refill my drink once? You're horrible but we all have off days.",Human
4diwg3,"Yeah, when by the time you bail there are sticky handprints everywhere, and debris under the table, plus it all had to be boxed quickly so you could finish at home with a less-miserable toddler, or at least where their rage won't disturb others, and the server cut the register line to get you rung up, after doing their best to get you something acceptable to feed the starving beast, that's when you gratefully ladle bills onto the table. ",Human
4diwg3,"Not sure how this compares, but I'm on minimum wage ($16NZD) with no tipping and I get ~$450 a week. Now I don't know what the exchange rate is but I feel like I'm getting the better deal here.",Human
4diwg3,"Nope. For me it's ""Shitty"" = 0%. ""Okay"" = 5%. ""Good"" = 10%. ""Amazing"" = 15%. Not everyone can indulge their server with an 18-20% tip. And that's only at restaurants or hair appointments.",Human
4diwg3,Ime 20% is standard. And for bar tenders it's 25%. ,Human
4diwg3,"It depends on the price and type of service.  I generally tip 20%, with a minimum of $2. The percentage changes based on quality of service, overall price, and the assumed hourly pay of the person. ",Human
4diwg3,Well it depends on how many hours your are assigned for. I work 35 hours and get about 900€ + 300€ tipping,Human
4diwg3,"Nope. It's more than I tip.

If I pick food up, I don't tip. Cooks get a standard wage and there was no serving staff.

I will tip for a good haircut but I don't usually tip because they make decent money.

I usually tip as a whole at the bar and it's usually only a few dollars because I don't require a lot and so they don't give a lot.

Tipping 15% constantly isn't being an asshole. ",Human
4diwg3,that's their job though. I don't have kids either. i'm tipping them for the service not how well they do their job.,Human
4diwg3,"Depends on where you live. Where I am, it's not about percentages. It's almost always flat amounts.

$1.00 is ""average"", $2.00 is ""better,"" $3.00 is ""good,"" $5.00 is ""great."" More than $5.00 is ""I had a birthday party.""

Had to do a presentation with 5 other students. 
Knuckleheads were lazy as fuck and didn´t do anything, but always were bloating about how they couldn´t afford a bad grade. At the third group meeting i finally snapped and shouted at them for half an hour. Everybody else who was in the bistro left due to my slightly agitated state of mind :D
Fun fact: In the end we worked pretty good as a group und delivered a good presentation.

Best thing to do for you: Make yourself leader and make sure everybody knows their part. If they won´t work with you (especially the current leader) make sure you talk to your teacher. No need for you to get a bad grade or fail class because you have morons in your group.

Nothing in the post makes you an asshole (going off the information presented). ",Human

You could try taking your dad aside, (not literally, obviously) and telling him his hobby has become an obsession, and is hurting his wife. It just may be the wrong time to spring on a guy who's just been disabled, but both you and her have undealt with resentment built up. At least tell him to stop being a shit patient and do as he's told, because he's not the only one affected. Tell him to stop moaning about the bikes, before he loses his wife and house as well.",Human
4dp5aw,"Resentment is a great word, I wish I had thought of it. 

The problem is that we've tried to talk to him about this before. He just goes into denial, gets offended, and then insults my hobbies. I'm not a big enough of a person to agree for the sake of placidity and then we start fighting. I love him, but goddamn do I not like talking to him. 

I know I should try and make him be nicer to my mother and the nurses and shit. But in defense, he is in a lot of pain -out of the ICU this morning, and I'm just not sure that this is really my place to say anything. ",Human

I'm more of a person that lives in denial and isolates myself to deal with it. I'm gonna have to learn to be better, I don't have a choice. I have to help him and I really can't let my anger and bitterness show. It'll just start more fights and I'm emotionally gone enough. ",Human
4dp5aw,"No, not an asshole. You're life has changed massively out of nowhere and it's not surprising that the stress is making you resentful.

I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be a psychologist but if your dad's obsession is at the point where it's actually affecting the house and his relationships then I think that he needs some real help. That's not me trying to diagnose anything, it just seems clear that he needs a professional because it sounds incredibly unhealthy.

However, even though this obsession has hurt people, I wouldn't say that he put himself in the position to get hurt like he did. It was a *drunk* driver. The guys who hit him fucked up bad, and it could have happened even if your dad was driving or walking. This event wasn't your dad's fault at all. His continued obsession over cycling, though, sounds like it could be an issue in the future.

So honestly I would try talking to a professional if you can. A pro can tell you if your dad's hobby is as destructive as it sounds and perhaps give you an idea of how to help. I know that in a lot of countries this sort of thing is expensive, but it's worth it if you think it'll lead to a healthier life for everyone.

I have friends that complain that I don't always respond and try to guilt me for it.  But I often work 16 hour shifts and giving my thoughts on a sports game just doesn't figure into my day.  You have to see how much he cares about you through different means because you arent, and shouldn't be, the only thing that matters to him so to pick him apart for something so small is a bit too far. ",Human
4dqv6w,"No, you're not an asshole for communicating feelings and needs to your boyfriend. Communication is important in a relationship. If all you did was tell him that it bothers you and asked him to respond, you are not an asshole. If you demanded he respond and you text him a hundred times a day, that would be a different story.

While this can be a deal breaker for some, as another user mentioned, it doesn't have to be a deal breaker for everyone. It could be that you and your boyfriend are just not compatible; he may not be a phone person and you are. Or it could be that one or the other of you doesn't have a very strong opinion on phones, and responding to your messages may be something he's willing to compromise on. ",Human
4dqv6w,"No you're not an asshole for letting asking him to try to respond quickly to your texts. Just keep in mind that he probably won't be able to respond immediately everytime. I know that's hard on you because of your social anxiety, but its not always possible to respond immediately. Talk with him about what he considers to be a reasonable timeframe to get back to you. If he says he will get back to you with in an hour, than you can use that knowledge to help keep calm if he doesn't respond right away. Do you see someone for your social anxiety? If so see if they have suggestions for coping techniques for when he can't respond right away. 

It perfectly reasonable to ask that he respond in a timely manner most of the time, but if you expect immediate responses everytime it steps across the line.",Human
4dqv6w,"Short answer: definitely not an asshole.

Long answer: my boyfriend is the same way as yours and I'm the same way as you, and it's really frustrating when he doesn't reply to or acknowledge my messages. I communicated to him that I needed response and he's just really not the type to text back and forth all day. At first it was a little bit of a problem, but now it's actually really refreshing not to have to be checking my phone all the time. We see each other almost every day, so there's no reason for us to text all day and then just sit in silence when we see each other. We compromised that he would always respond when we were making plans and also when we would not be seeing each other that say. On days we don't see each other, we usually only talk in the evening/at night when both of us are done with school/work/etc. Maybe y'all can come up with a similar solution?",Human

4dqv6w,"You're not an asshole yet. But I've noticed that a lot of people who say stuff like ""please don't ignore messages"" usually have to say so because they text too often. Also, if you are not being considerate of the fact that his life does not, should not and will not revolve around you then you're the asshole. Don't demand his time, just let him know how you feel.  So no one's an asshole but keep in mind that you aren't entitled to anyone's time.",Human
4dqv6w,"I actually had the same problem as you with my boyfriend. We reached an agreement that he would text me when he knew he was going to be busy (""Hey I'm going longboarding and won't be on my phone!"") so I knew what he was up to and that he wouldn't be replying to me. That made it much easier for me to deal with. ",Human
4dqv6w,Yeah. Chill out.,Human
4dqv6w,"I feel like I communicated that I don't expect immediate responses and not even all the time. My issue is that often he just doesn't bother replying to things at all at any point and the next time we talk would often be hours or even a day later when I initiated conversation again. Also we don't see each other all that often in person. 

I myself don't respond right away and would hate to be expected to so I definitely didn't want him to feel like I wanted his immediate attention all the time. But generally I will always respond with something even if later and not outright ignore people because I don't want them to feel that way and I follow the same rule with him. Also he really is a phone person which is why it upset me. ",Human
4dqv6w,"Definitely not expecting immediate replies at all. Just some level of replying at some point is all I was after. He just has a habit of being on Facebook, seeing my message and never replying (which is why I hate the new Facebook stuff because I'd rather not know these things because then I'd assume he's busy rather than feeling outright ignored). Even if he's not in the mood to reply (and again that's absolutely fine with me) I would rather he didn't open it and replied later instead of opening and never replying if that makes sense. ",Human
4dqv6w,"As said earlier, not about immediate responses. More about not responding at all. I tried to communicate that to him because immediate responses is definitely an unreasonable request. ",Human
4dqv6w,"I totally get that. I have a friend who is on her phone 24/7, yet when I text her she often doesn't respond at all, even if it's something that really warrants a response. I'd tell her something important, then she doesn't text anything for two days and starts a different subject after that. If she was my SO, it would drive me crazy. That doesn't mean that what she's doing is objectively wrong, just that I can't deal with it.

If you tell him how much it bothers you, you give him the chance to adapt his behavior to your needs. You'd be an asshole if you left him in the dark and just became more and more frustrated over time. He will feel the frustration without having a chance to do anything about it if you don't tell him what's up.",Human
4dqv6w,"I'm that person, who sees a text and will just respond hours later. I just don't like texting, but I'll get around to it eventually.

4dtnx6,"Not the asshole. At the end of the day it's a rectangular piece of wood, doesn't seem all that custom to me. Half of Business Is coming up with a good estimate. If they can't estimate the work going into sanding and staining a rectangle how are they in business at all?",Human
4dtnx6,"No, you're not the asshole.  I have quoted people for custom jobs before and you have to do better than that.

""Materials are $60, the labor is $X per hour, I would estimate 1-2 hours...""

It's true you can't quote an exact figure but you have to be reasonably close.  5 times the only dollar amount ever quoted?  Ridiculous.  I'm not saying they did anything wrong, but they certainly didn't do anything competent.",Human
4dtnx6,"Yeah, it seems like a really disadvantageous strategy for the person actually doing the labor.

""Here's the base price, do you want this option? Yeah? Great""

*does labor*

""OK, here's the final price with a huge markup I didn't bother to initially disclose. What? You can't afford it? You didn't ask me how much it would cost.""",Human
4dtnx6,"If that's what they meant, they should have said it like I've heard mechanics give quotes: ""The alternator is 250 and then probably an hour or two of labor, so probably ~400 total.""

4dtnx6,"Good point. The answer might simply be that it's some rando off of Craigslist, haha.",Human
4dtnx6,"To be fair, that's the base price. They gave no indication of how much labor, etc. Would cost. Needles to say, a surprise $300 for a piece of wood is ridiculous. ",Human
4dtnx6,"See, that seems reasonable. I'm super confused as to how they think this business model is appropriate. All of the labor, with none of the profit, and customer dissatisfaction to boot.",Human

4dtnx6,Good job OP. ,Human
4dtnx6,"Honestly, it seems like they may have worded it vaguely so they could charge more and get away with it, since a lot of people won't stand up for themselves and will just pay what they ask for to avoid an awkward situation. ",Human
4dtnx6,"That's a great point. I don't accept no guff from no one, haha.",Human
4dtnx6,"&gt;Since I didn't sign a contract

You don't have to sign a contract to be liable, email text can act as a written contract in court (at least in the US).  But you put a stipulation of wanting to know the cost first, which they didn't comply do.  It's their mistake, I don't think you're an asshole for not paying.",Human
4dtnx6,"Over here it's customary for the seller to write up a quote beforehand. Isn't that how it's done where you live?

Basically it's the seller saying ""I will do it for this amount of money"" and then you sign a document agreeing to this. If the seller makes some bad estimates and it ends up costing a lot more than what he though it would, that's bad luck for him but the price remains the same.

This really is very basic business practice over here. If the seller wouldn't do this, he's pretty damn unprofessional.

So no, you're not an asshole for backing out, you both just don't really seem to know what you're doing. You live, you learn.",Human
4dtnx6,"If you verbatim asked for a **total** price, you're in the right.

If the seller is completely unable to estimate time range to be spent on something, they are a terrible seller.  Considering they are on Craigslist instead of a site with ratings like etsy, I'd wager they know they can't cut it.

Just to be safe, I'd back up all those text messages if I were you.",Human
4dtnx6,"Not the asshole, for a few reasons. 

1) They said: ""I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.""""

Fucking bullshit, they're a carpenter and they 'don't know' how much work it is to sand and finish a single piece of wood?  It's really fucking basic. I've done like, 2 woodworking projects ever and I could give you an accurate estimate for this.  It would take maybe 3 hours of actual work, tops.  

2) They didn't tell you the final price or even an estimate up front.  This is amateur at best, scammy at worst.  Either they were trying to rip you off, or you taught them a valuable lesson about how to deal with customer, i.e. get it in writing!  They are either stupid or severely dishonest, possibly both. ",Human
4dtnx6,"In order for there to be a legal contract, both parties have to have some understanding of what they are agreeing to.  In this case, that clearly didn't happen. ",Human
4dtnx6,My thoughts exactly. It seems ridiculous that they couldn't estimate the amount of work that needed to be done. ,Human
4dtnx6,Good point. I have all the messages on my phone. ,Human
4dtnx6,"It seems like he's the asshole. It seems like he didn't tell you that the extra glossing and such would cost extra money. Giving an estimate is part of doing contract work. Sure it should be understood that it is just an estimate, but if cost starts to look like it is going to far exceed the estimate then you contact the customer and verify that he is willing to pay for it. He should have made it clear that the glossing costs extra money. Otherwise it seems reasonable to assume that it is part of the service.

I used to have a mechanic who worked on my car. We did regular business. If I took my car into him for some work and it ended up that more and different work was needed than originally talked about he would call me to talk about it, how much it would cost, and if I was prepared to pay for it. He wouldn't just assume that I'm willing to pay an extra  $100 than what we had discussed. This is just good and proper business.

I have numeral examples like this throughout my life. Repair work for a watch. Contract work on a house. Etc. We always agree on a fairly accurate estimate before actual work on the final product is began.",Human
4dtnx6,"It is totally ridiculous.  If you can't even *guess* how long it takes to sand and finish 18 square feet of wood, you really have no business selling woodworking services. ",Human
4dtnx6,"Sure, it's an implicit contract to pay the amount discussed, which according to OP was $60-100.  You can't really claim there was a contract to pay some random amount that never came up in writing. ",Human
4dtnx6,"Yes, totally. And yeah, it would be shocking if this 'carpenter' tried to sue, even more so if they came away with a dime. ",Human
4dtnx6,"They literally made no mention of extra costs. They had the gall to blame me. They said it's currently $60, so in my mind I thought the price wouldn't deviate too far from that.",Human
4dtnx6,"Hahaha, right?",Human
4dtnx6,"For those interested, this is what they said at the end of the back and forth regarding price:

""If you don't ask, why would I expect there to be a problem. If a slab of wood is already at 60 you should expect the price to go up substantially. 60 is already a high price for a slab as the one I had. I put several hours into that so yea I I'm going to charge quite a bit. Its the buyers job to ask the questions. I told you it would all depend on how many hours I put into it. You had no follow up ? As to a ball park price. You went right into dimensions. I'm sorry you feel misled but that is not my fault you had no follow up questions for me. I've sold many of these and have never had a problem. Let's just let this be the end of this because I don't have time to go back and forth over this.""

What do you think? ",Human
4dtnx6,They should have given you some sort of indication of those costs though.,Human
4dtnx6,It should have been his job to disclose an estimate of the extra costs. He's completely unjustified in blaming you for not asking that specific question.,Human
4dtnx6,"OK, good to know I'm not the only one thinking this way.",Human
4dtnx6,"Not the asshole. At all. I used to work at a woodshop. A 6'x18""x1"" sanded and finished board for $300 is a ripoff. Plain and simple. Anyone with any remote skill at the job could whip that up in a day and everything beyond the first hour would just be waiting for the finish to fully dry so no actual labor cost in that. 

That line about how long it will taste to sand down is utter bs. Something like that isn't that hard to sand if they have decent equipment which any semi-professional shop should have.",Human
4dtnx6,"Good to know this level of insider info, this is super helpful!

Now that you're here, I was wondering what you would suggest if I wanted to acquire or even put together a wooden desktop of those dimensions. What would be the most cost-effective way to do so?

Would I have to go for solid hardwood, or could I get away with plywood?",Human
4dtnx6,"Plywood would probably be the best way. On the original example of the 18"" wide board the one difficulty I could foresee is getting a board that wide. It's possible but not always available everywhere depending on your supplier. For hardwood the alternative would be gluing two boards side by side and cutting it down to 18 inches. 

Plywood comes in 4'x8' sheets so it would be easy to cut to whatever specifications. Two things with that though: most shops commonly stock 3/4"" plywood not 1"". Plywood also tends to not be as durable as solid wood. It might dent or ding up easily especially if you don't use a durable finish. 

Unless you are going for something elegant plywood would be the way to go all around. If you are trying to save money you can assemble it all yourself provided you have a drill. Just pick up some 3/4"" sheetrock screws from your hardware store. 

If you don't have a table saw or a friend with one you can probably have a wood shop cut all the pieces to a specified dimension. Wouldn't take more than a few minutes for them to do so I can't imagine they would charge much. 

If using plywood you would want to edge band the sides to make it look like a solid piece. A woodshop could do it or you can buy the banding tape yourself. The stuff I always used was iron on but they might have some no iron stuff out there. You also wanna to sand it smooth before finishing but be careful not to burn through the top layer of the plywood. 

Then comes finishing. Finishing can b",Human
4dtnx6,"This is amazing, thank you so much!",Human
4dtnx6,"Np. Some design tips. I dunno the style you are actually going for whether its a table style or a framed cabinet style. If it's a framed cabinet make the frame separate from the table top. 

You can do something simple like a box(well..rectangle) frame. Standard desk height is 28-30 inches. If you go for 30 then the frame itself should be 29 1/4 high to account for the top assuming you are going with a 3/4"" board for the top too.

You could do something like I have in [this](http://imgur.com/w1461r1) rudimentary drawing.

The white would be the sides shown top and front. Those could be 18 x 29 1/4 x 3/4. The other 4 pieces shown in colors could be something simple like 2"" x 6' x 3/4. 2 of those long pieces would be vertical in the back of the desk frame. for structural stability. 2 would be horizontal on the top of the desk frame. You would then screw the table top on from the bottom through the two horizontal ones so no screws show on top of the table top.

For even more aesthetics if you take it somewhere to cut the pieces they might have a pocket screw jig to predrill the holes out of the 2x6 pieces so you don't have to plant the screws in the sides of the desk. Google pocket screw if you are unfamiliar with the term.

This entire thing, table top and all, could be done out of a single 4x8 of plywood. Alternatively you could spend a little more on wood and less on finish and have the frame done out of plywood and the top done out of a melamine. Black maybe. A nice finished",Human
4dtnx6,"Awesome. All I need is the desk/table top. It will be resting on top of two filing cabinets. Nonetheless, this is very helpful!",Human
4dtnx6,Heh np. Bored at work and this kept me entertained. If you want to get away cheap and don't care too much about aesthetics then go with melamine. One quick cut on a table saw is all you would need. Edge banding would make it look nicer otherwise just take a piece of sand paper and run it along the edges to break them as to not be sharp. ,Human
4dy1f9,"Too close to call. The Walmart in my neighborhood has these wheels, but my experience has been that the cashier loads the items into the bags. They usually do it as they scan things; at the Walmart, there isn't enough counter space to leave the items sitting. 

So, on one hand, I don't think the cashiers should refuse to bag the items. On the other, I don't know why you can't bag them, either. I don't think you're *entitled* to have your items bagged; I've never seen bagging as a service I'm paying for.  

If I was in line behind you, I would totally get what you're doing and even agree with you that the cashier should bag your stuff, but I'd give you an eye roll for not just bagging it yourself. It just isn't a battle I would fight.",Human
4dy1f9,"I know some stores have reduced prices and as such you either bag your own groceries or you may even have to pay for bags if you didn't bring your own. You pay less because they have less employees to pay and as such, there is more participation from the customer. 

Yes, I think you are an asshole. If it is expected everyone will bag their own groceries, but you just stare at thw cashier until they give in, that's asshole behavior. ",Human
4dy1f9,"The Walmart method is another interesting thing to throw in the mix, as the stands are quite similar and the customer is already conditioned to have the cashier place the items in the bag then rotate the carousel.  The difference, that I've seen, is the distance between the cashier and the carousel is much further at my grocery store than it is at Walmart.  At Walmart they can scan and bag in one move, but at the grocery store they would have to take a step to bag the item.  So is that added distance that disrupts the flow of bagging part of the design to get the customer to bag their own stuff, or is it simply poor design?  

As for the worthiness of the battle, so far I am winning by doing nothing, so I am not really putting any effort into the fight.  It took more effort to write this post than I've had to put into the battle.  If they straight up told me I'm supposed to bag my own stuff perhaps I would fall in line, or perhaps I'd go to the next closest store which isn't much further away.  ",Human
4dy1f9,"I've shopped at places like that and it's something you tend to know going in.  This particular store doesn't offer discounts for using your own bags, nor do I deem there to be any incentive to bag your own stuff beyond not feeling like there are judging eyes upon you.  

So maybe I am the asshole for going against expectations, but in my defense they changed the method without directly informing the customer as to what their intent actually is, I just look at the new set up and go ""They *probably* want me to bag my own stuff, but if they are not going to actually inform me of that then I am going to carry on per usual"".  ",Human
4dy1f9,"I think it is bullshit for them to change the set up and not specify who does what. I'd say the first couple times you went and  played the waiting game with the cashier were fine, you were feeling it out. You did say other stores in the area had a traditional bagging set up. So if you are going to this particular store, with the knowledge that you probably should be bagging and just not doing it then yes you are the asshole. Especially If I'm behind you in line. Try Complaining to the store manager or instigating a riot over unfair bagging practices. ",Human
4dy1f9,"While I agree with others that you're kind of in a grey area in regards to store policy/intent, I've got to say that I think in this case you definitely are the asshole.

1. You're slowing down the line to make a point, and a somewhat petty point at that.

2. You are observing others bagging their own items, so claiming ignorance of ~~store policy~~ expected behavior doesn't work.

3. Even if there is no store policy in place, why fight this fight? You're just punishing the cashier with your passive-aggressive challenge, and they likely had nothing to do with this change.

If it bothers you this much *say* something to management, ask someone for clarification, or *just go somewhere else*. Continuing to do what you've been doing makes you the asshole.

Where I live, all supermarket checkouts are manned by one person who does both the scanning and the bagging as they go, it's standard here and nobody ever complains about it. However there is one chain that does not bag groceries and instead has a long counter along the front of the store for you to take your groceries and bag them after the cashier scans and you pay. If you're buying a cart full of stuff, you pretty much have to reload the cart, walk it two metres, unpack it, bag it, put it back in the cart. I fucking hate going there because it's a pain in the ass, but about 80% of said chain's products are exclusive to them. It sucks but you kind of have to play by their rules, it's not the cashier's fault the store changed some operational methods. I just limit how much I buy there.

My parents used to ask me every year if I wanted a party and I would always say ""No, lets just go out to dinner the four of us and have some cake afterwards."" They always respected my wishes though. I don't like birthday parties and don't think the birthday is that big of a deal anyway. You told them what you wanted to do for your birthday and they disregarded what you said and they did something that makes you uncomfortable. You are not the asshole.",Human

Getting into an argument after your parents already planned a party and invited extended family..   useless.  
   
Get used to ""having"" to attend, or being obliged to participate in family events when you don't want to.     Most of the family events in my 50 years.. my own family and friends..   every time at least one or more of the folks there really didn't want to be there.     Do it, smile about it,  and do your best to enjoy the company.   The next time you see any one of them could be the funeral.

I'm essentially being forced to celebrate it with plans I dont agree with, but I came to a newn conclusion. Your birthday isn't just about you. It's about your parents and family remembering the day you were given life. And whether it kept a husband and wife together, or succeeding with a small percentage of being able to get pregnant, I can't imagine how precious that day must be for a mom and dad.

4e30xv,"Yes. You are lazy. Why are you at your husbands' (im guessing, because of that so nonesense) parents house on garden dirt day if you were not gonna help? Didja make them lunch or do anything productive to the group or just watch the baby sleep? Weird.",Human
4e30xv,"It was at our house.

I wasn't watching the baby sleep; I was looking after her. As every day, the only down time was when she was sleeping, when I did a bit of housework but was also took a bit of time for myself.",Human

The in-laws are ~60 y.o. Sometimes MIL looks after the baby while I cook or something but in this case both in-laws wanted to be in the garden as they were the ones who knew what the plan was (where and how to move all the soil). They'd arranged it; I didn't know anything about it.",Human

Also, do not blame others for your bad behavior. Statements like 'she made me lose my temper' is one of the main indicators of an abuser. Thats not my opinion, you can Google that! There are other troubling things you say and ways that you speak. 

I stand by my advice that you should walk away from this.",Human

Losing one's temper doesnt mean i grabbed a glass and chucked it across the room or screamed at her. You need better context because if I had done that I probably would have mentioned it. Take your own advice and don't blame others for your grand overassumptions of what people mean when they explain how they were feeling.

Essentially the way they put their foot down it shows that they see themselves as doing you a favour by allowing you to stay for the price.

That is the real issue. With family paying more may not help. You could offer more under the guise of a right to privacy but they could take the money and back out on it. Moving is your best bet to maintain relationships.

I couldn't imagine having randoms staying in my room. Fuck that noise.

And that's exactly what the sub is for. We still like to give advice though, but that's not official. I agree with everyone else, and also hazard a guess that maybe they want you to leave? In their eyes, they helped out a nephew, by boarding him for whatever reason - maybe it was more convenient, maybe nothing else came up, or maybe they needed the extra money, but now it seems you earn a bit more, and they kinda want their own space back now. People are weird and can't come out and discuss it, so maybe they're trying to give subtle hints that they want that space.

I moved in with them because I needed somewhere to live (moving back to my parents' was not an option - it would have been too far from my job at the time), after pulling out of a lease at another place because I didn't mesh with my former roommates and I didn't like the fact they were heavy pot smokers, exacerbated by a new roommate coming in (friend of one of the roommates who had been evicted from his last place), who was a total deadbeat. At that point I was paying all the bills, expenses, etc, and they would frequently fall behind, so I was like ""fuck this, I'm out of here, it's all yours now"".

I appreciate that my aunt helped me out, I really do.

A few years back, I was out at a VERY nice restaurant (There were 6 of us for dinner, our bill came out to over $3k. A buddy won a big jackpot at the local casino so he was treating his friends/wives.)  

Anyway, after dinner, we go into the bar, and my friend wants to do shots of [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_de_R%C3%A9my_Martin). So all the guys belly up to a table, I'm the only woman left, and I'm the DD. I'm stone cold sober. 

There was a barfly there. She looked to be pushing 70. Dressed very nicely, all designer, drunk as shit. I mean, I can't believe she was walking. She kept coming over and getting all touchy with my husband. I'm not a jealous woman, I've been with my husband at strip clubs, so women touching my husband is not something that just sets me off. This goes on for longer and longer. The guys start talking about how she's making them uncomfortable and tell her to please go back to her table. 

She does, just long enough for another couple shots and comes back. My poor husband... she tries to CLIMB into his fucking lap, and tells him, ""come on, buy me a shot."" I look at him, and mouth ""can I?"" he just nods. 
I shoved her as hard as my foot would push. She fell off his lap, this didn't phase her. She gets up and puts her arm around him, basically flashing her tits in his face. I shove her away and told her that he was my husband and if she didn't keep her hands to herself, I was going to be taking her out",Human

But having some parts of the elite controller behaving worse than a stock  controller is no bueno.",Human
4ejeez,"Maybe it's a shipment issue? When I bought a laptop a few years back I had a battery issue. Took it in a week later and replaced it. Same battery issue came up with the new one. So, maybe the batch at that Gamestop isn't functiona? Can you return to any Gamestop or does it have to be the one you bought from? If you can go anywhere, try finding another place. Or return it, get the money, and find somewhere else to go. 

If that is the case and it is a manufacturing flaw, it shouldn't  be a problem getting it refunded, especially if you explain it to them. If you go in expecting a certain product, you should be getting that product, imo.

Alternatively, perfect is relative. What may be perfect for the general public might not be working for you. Of course, I don't know much about the One or the Elite Controller, so honestly I can't speak on what the controller is supposed to be.",Human

I'm not expecting *perfection* out of a mass produced gadget, I'm realistic.

And that D pad is out of range because I've already read other accounts of flawed D pads. I hear of them because they're trying to go through Microsoft to get a refund/exchange and that's apparently a nightmare.

4ejeez,"yes, you would be the asshole if you keep returning controllers. The store  looses money everytime you return a broken product.

""As part of the GameStop family of technology brands, we will provide you with world-class service and products. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, let us help you with a replacement, return, or exchange....

*Opened New accessories can be returned or exchanged within 30 days""

I like the controller just fine. I love it, in fact. What I don't like is companies like Microsoft charging me a premium price for something that has the potential of not being top quality. GameStop has my back on this. They know shit like this happens with products, and they know they would have gone out of business a long time ago if they didn't handle it by way of ""bring anything back within 30 days, we'll give you a new one, no problem."" 

(and yes, I know they state 'replacement, return or exchange' so that by the tenth replacement the manager can try to find another solution to satisfy the customer. It is not so that I have to be stuck with what I've bought just because it's not technically broken.) 

",Human
4ejeez,"I know the return policy because I used to work there. I'm letting you know that if you keep returning things over and over when its not broken that they could ban you.

They only take opened items back if they are damaged, because they can't sell an open item as new anymore.

And if you want to be the spineless dweeb that won't take a multi-million dollar corporation up on it's own policies because you've been brainwashed from being a manager yourself, be my guest. But I'm not going to just bend over and take it and accept a lemon because GameStop might be out a couple dollars if I don't. That's their problem, not mine. 

That's why GameStop is so successful... Jesus, did you even pay attention to the videos when you got trained? I never worked there and I know more about the business than you do. 

GameStop's bread and butter works like this: GameStop sells the consoles with hardly any warranty or return policy because the manufactures will handle those. Then GameStop picks and chooses what it feels are the best selection of accessories to go with them and sells those, with their name behind it. 

Customers can rest assured that when they go to GameStop, the selection of items to choose from is of a certain level of quality. They know that because GameStop is one of *many* companies that makes *sure* their customers don't walk out the door with a piece of crap. Or if that's the case will give a refund. ",Human
4ejeez,"Jesus, are you 14? Gamestop doesn't offer endless replacements until you've found the perfectly symmetrical controller. You even admitted that you would be lying if you told them it was broken. That's the unethical part that makes you an asshole.             
                  
You could probably take it back a few more times before they start getting annoyed, but I just wanted to give you fair warning that you can't keep taking it back until you find the perfect one.            
               
You are actually wrong about Gamestop's ""bread and butter"". They make almost all of their money from used games and accessories. They don't make alot from new items which is why they're very strict about new item returns.",Human
4ejeez,"Ok, you still think I've got some sort of scheme going and I'm trying to get one over on GameStop cause I'm whiny. 
I returned one. And felt like an asshole for it. Then I thought, ""gee, this one seems to have some issues too. What do I do? I can't just keep taking them back. I'll ask Reddit."" and I have since been pondering about how to make sure the next controller I get is the one I'm happy with so I don't have to go through any of this. 

And I'm not saying their b&amp;b is new accessories. Their b&amp;b is over the top customer satisfaction. Doing whatever it takes to make a customer say ""I'm going back to GameStop for all my gaming needs"". 

I'm sorry you have to hear this, but that means *putting up with the customer that wants to get the damn controller he paid for*. Within reason, of course. But not turning away someone a second, third, fourth, or God forbid a fifth or maybe even sixth time they come back. And do you know why? Because they keep coming back to *you*.

Who's to say they don't buy a new pair of headphones while they're in there to do an exchange? Or a couple new games? They've already bought an Xbox One, games, and an Elite controller from you. If this little speed bump about a controller turns into a big issue with the manager, kiss that customer goodbye. That's easily a thousand dollar bill a year or more walking out of your store for good. 

You're clearly not looking at the big picture. How many customers did you ban from your store? Maybe not many ",Human

Lying to take advantage of a return policy is literally a scheme. If you think there is an actual defect then you're fine, but that's not what you said in your post. Is it or is it not fucking defective? Make up you mind.

As a side note: I hate to burst your bubble, but the biggest complaint we heard from customers was about the return policy. You can pretend to know the buisness all you want, but you have zero experience and no concept of how businesses run.",Human
4ejeez,"If the unit doesn't perform as advertised, it's defective. Every button on the controller (you know, the important parts) is supposed to be a precision piece of hardware, not most of them. If it feels like I'd rather be using my 360s Dpad over this one, I'd say that's defective. If you say it's not because it technically still works then you're an ass. 

And I happen to think GameStop's return policy is fucking amazing. I don't know what kind of stuck up snob town you live in. 

And you better believe customer service is the number one most important thing to a retail store, big or small. If you don't understand that, then you're the one with no idea how businesses run.

Relationships are demanding. They require work and sacrifice. Furthermore, you're entitled to how you feel about the relationship, and well within your right to bring up concerns regarding that relationship.

What this means for you going forward is another conversation. However if you brought your feelings up civilly, and within all fairness to you, your SO, and your relationship, then you're not the asshole.",Human
4ek19h,"This is not an ""asshole"" situation. 

Two people head into a relationship with individual expectations of what that relationship will be like, they bring different wants and needs and ways of acting. Ideally, people would fall in love with people who completely match them in all these respects, but that rarely happens.

It's great that you've raised this with your SO to give him the opportunity to change his ways if he wasn't previously aware of how he was behaving and/or how you perceived his behaviour. But based on your post, your SO has made it quite clear that he's either not bothered by the way his behaviours affect you, or if he is bothered, he's still not that motivated to do anything about it.

Your SO is showing you how he acts in the relationship. Your job now is to decide whether to accept that or not. Every relationship requires compromise and if all other aspects of the relationship are good, maybe this is something you decide to compromise on. But understand that it is a compromise. Accept the compromise and move on.  There's little to be gained by hoping that he will change or by constantly nagging that he isn't the perfect person you'd like him to be.

You and your boyfriend have different ideas of how to display love and affection.  He has plainly said that he doesn't see the value in these things, even if he recognizes that you do.  You're doing things that he never asked for, doesn't want, and expecting him to have a different reaction.  You're also asking for him to do something that he doesn't probably understand and can't ever know if he's done it correctly.

**But I wonder what this statement *really* means:**

&gt; I just found out from my Mom that I'm supposed to go to my grandma's for dinner tonight.

Did they actually tell you about Grandma's thing earlier and you just found out you forget, or did they make up an event at the spur of the moment and said you can go screw if you already had something planned?  This needs clarification.

I'm on the fence about your mom being the asshole too, because I'm assuming the dinner idea materialized today, and wonder why this dinner--that they didn't bother to plan ahead of time--is so important that you need to miss a pre-arranged birthday party for it.  

--

**Also, do you cancel a lot on your friend?**  If so, I can see why she'd be mad at you for this forced cancellation.  If one of my friends is always there for me, but has a family emergency or problem that makes them flake once, they get a complete pass.  But if they always cancel things and/or fail to show up, and then they miss something important, I think I have the right to be pissed even if they had a great excuse the latest time, because the pattern has already shown they they don't care enough to make room for me.  ",Human

The next day she probably woke up, realized she was drunk, assumed that her gadar was whacked, and moved on with her life.

She went to a GAY bar and hit on a guy.  What did she think would happen?  I think it's commendable that you are concerned about her feelings enough to torture yourself about being an asshole, but I think you're fine.  

The girl's friend, OTOH, is an asshole, for jumping in your shit for being direct.  If the situation were reversed - straight woman in a lesbian bar gets hit on by a man who realizes she's straight, is shot down quickly, and his male friend calls her an asshole, we'd all think the male friend was being oppressive and vile for demanding that she put up with their nonsense, especially at 2AM.  The context is irrelevant though.  Nobody owes anybody anything.  At 2AM, far less is expected/owed.

You are in college and it's easy to be kind of selfish and self-centered at this age. You kind of got the best of both worlds here; you hooked up with a girl, and still kept the quasi-relationship on line for you. Why didn't you chose to tell the girl you hooked up with that you were seeing someone else? It's not straight up lying, but it is dishonest. Good news is, you probably don't feel great about this so the best thing you can do is learn to not objectify anyone and you will probably think twice before not telling the complete truth.

Honestly, when the girl came over to my apartment, I didn't even really want to hook up with her, because I am pretty emotionally attached to the girl I'm in a quasi-relationship with. I was really drunk and made a poor decision, and I know that's not an excuse but I know I wouldn't have made the same decision sober.

I definitely do feel really shitty because I completely empathize with the girl I hooked up with, and I feel terrible that she felt shitty about the whole situation. If a situation like this does arrive in the future, I definitely will tell the complete truth about my emotions as to not complicate things. While I will consider this a learning experience, I wish it didn't have to end up like this for the people involved.

Thanks again for the input!

P.S. As to why I didn't tell her about my relationship with the other girl, I'm honestly not sure. Again, it's not an excuse, but it was 3am and I had been drunk for around 14 hours, and I wasn't thinking clearly. I had a pretty crappy night and I felt bad, and I guess I just appreciated the temporary physical/emotional connection with someone, and I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize it, if that makes sense.

Your future is positive and bright; keep working at establishing meaningful relationships, and keep working on establishing your own personal values, and beliefs.

From a female standpoint, she will also learn, she will accept your apology (even if she acts like she doesn't), she will grow, and she will have this experience as a part of her story. So the best thing to do is give a sincere apology...

There are infinitely better ways of dealing with this type of situation.  Not the least of which is stop being friends with or hanging out around jerks. 

Yes, he was in the wrong for kissing you on multiple occasions.  For hitting in you while knowing you are in a relationship.  But hitting is not okay.

You can argue self defense.  He grabbed you and kissed you without permission. But I am going to point out the obvious here. Self defense is a *defense*. Used to justify *illegal* behavior. If something you do can cause medical bills and criminal charges, it is not okay.

So he is an asshole. But resorting to violence, escalating after he released you, makes you an asshole too.",Human
4fheqa,"&gt;He pushed me against a wall... *When he released me*

No, I don't think you're an asshole simply because he pushed you against the wall. That's assault. If he pushed you against the wall, I am assuming it was overpowering and the punch was a sort of defense (if delayed). You mention that he had to release you before you were able to hit him. That tells me you were overpowered by him. If I'm reading this wrong, please let me know.

Kissing you against your will is also assault.

If he had kissed you and you later punched him without being in the situation, you'd be an asshole and you would be guilty of assault on him. But in the situation, it's justified. **He is not allowed to do things with your body that you are not okay with,** and that includes overpowering you to do what he wants (immobilizing you against a wall so he can kiss you). 

This can be hard for society to acknowledge sometimes, because we're taught to think, ""After all, it's just a little kiss!"" So whatever the outcome of this subreddit, don't let people make you blame yourself at all in this situation. He is 100% in the wrong here.",Human

4fheqa,"Absolutely not. You told the guy several times you didn't want him to kiss you. He knows you're in a relationship and he's been told to respect it by you and your new BF. If he forces himself on you like that after hearing all that, then a good punching is probably what he deserved.

4fheqa,Punching people *without cause* is illegal.,Human
4fheqa,"You are most certainly wrong.

If OP had hit him the first time, she would've been in the wrong.  Instead, she civilly explained that what he did is unacceptable.  If she had hit him the second time, she would've been justified in a disgusted push and some choice language, but instead she chose to explain to him that she was not interested.  Her new boyfriend also explained to him that his actions were unacceptable.  The third time he steps out of line, she defends herself physically after it has become apparent that words have zero effect on this ""man.""  This was clearly self-defense and any judge in your jurisdiction will see that if ""John"" ever decided to press charges.

&gt; Think about what a cop would see if he walked up to this situation. A guy with a busted nose and blood down his shirt, and a girl with a bruised hand saying ""I did it because he kissed me."" Charges.

First, she would have said, ""I did it because he kissed me without permission."" second, you're assuming the cop is walking in there, taking a quick look around hearing two sides to the story, and leaving with two people in handcuffs.  There are still other people in the dwelling and they would be asked what happened.  It would be on them to let the officer know that she would have been in the right because John has a history of acting this way.

&gt;They should have been held responsible for that failure

As should the person who performed the assault. You're pretty big on placing the blame on the people who *can't predict when an assault will occur and thus don't prevent it*, aren't you?

How the actual heck did she escalate the situation, by having lips? By going into another room?

She only hit him the one time, which de-escalated the situation by incapacitating him (had his nose not been broken, he would've been able to focus enough to lash out physically), as opposed to beating him severely, which would warrant the charges you so desperately want brought against her.  

&gt; She refused to keep herself away from a known danger = asshole.

Again, this doesn't make her the asshole because *she didn't know that he was a danger*.  In the two prior incidents, he didn't use force to have his way, he simply made a move before she was able to react.  That doesn't give any indication that he would soon turn violent in his actions.  She and others, being friends with him and knowing him a long time, chose to give him the benefit of the doubt because *he was a friend.*  Also something worth noting: in your entire argument, both with me and others, you haven't once said that *he* should've changed, only that his actions were wrong, but you've also been quick to castigate the victim here for not having extrasensory perception or a crystal ball.

Sometimes it is. Like when someone or something forcefully and aggressively invades your personal space and you need to protect yourself. This isn't to be tolerated. Protecting yourself should never be viewed as going too far.

&gt;Honestly, I'm tired of women saying they're not responsible for what happens to them because they were drunk.

In some circumstances I totally agree with you, but this rhetoric has no place here. This is a case of one person forcing himself on another.

Without hearing what actually happened in the bathroom we don't truly know. Although; everyone was drinking, so does it really matter? Does it really matter what was said as you were both under the influence (even if slightly).

So you're saying you don't remember if you told her to fuck off but it sounds like something you would do?  Am I reading that correctly?

If that's what happened, normally people don't hold a grudge for that long.  That's just weird.  

If you don't remember it happening, maybe that's not what happened.  Maybe she has other motives for not wanting to come to your wedding.  And a best friend is usually the maid of honor and not just a guest.  Unless you guys aren't having a wedding party.

4fyuff,"While I don't see any blatant assholery here, it's hard to say any more. You've given a lot of detail, and a fair bit of both sides, but I still feel it may not be enough to say.

Maybe it depends on the terms of your relationship. I know that with my partner, we seem to have mostly agreed that neither of us has to support the other. You can't really compel another person to support you through school, even if it's your partner. To be the better person here you may need to drop your expensive hobby and save up. Make your dreams clear and hope your partner is generous. Whining may become an asshole move eventually, especially if it's proven ineffective and you're just using it as a crutch to avoid making changes to yourself.",Human
4fyuff,"Not being able to hold a job for longer than 6 months seems like an issue. I wouldn't be able to live with that kind of instability. It seems very immature to me. Work is work. It isn't supposed to be play, even if you are lucky enough to wind up with a career that you find rewarding. It sucks sometimes, and you have to put up with it sucking to get to where you want to be.

But ultimately, a situation like this is too complex for the scope of this sub. You might want to look into talking to a marriage counselor before this becomes too much of an issue. Or maybe that isn't the best advice. I don't know. However, it will take more work than just determining a person to blame.",Human
4fyuff,"One detail that i think is important, that you haven't explicitly stated (though I can guess based on the fact that you're posting your question here), is how your husband reacts when you get on his case. 

Either way, I wouldn't say you're an asshole for advising him against his potentially dangerous behavior. While there are indeed other important factors, like how you've agreed to divide expenses and whether any of his income helps support your hobby, I am inclined to say that you're not an asshole since his behavior is quite obviously unhealthy and risky from a financial well-being standpoint. 

However, in my opinion his reaction to your comments will determine whether he is an asshole, or whether there are no assholes here. Failing that detail, I am **assuming** that he gives you a hard time when you talk to him about this, and **would therefore find that he is the asshole**.

Separate from all this, if I were you I would try to help him determine why he does this - is it possible he has a form of psychological condition (ADD?) that's causing him to act this way? That is, if constructive discussion can take place on the matter.",Human

You're absolutely getting the raw end of the deal and I'm surprised people here are actually telling you to give up your hobbies (probably the thing keeping you from snapping under the stress) to accommodate your husband refusing to take responsibility. 

Stuff like this says it all:
&gt;he gets to quit his job whenever, but I don't

When he can't keep a job for more than a few months, it means that even if your job is 1,000x worse, you're stuck because him always being comfortable and happy has become the ultimate priority in your relationship.",Human
4fyuff,"I don't know that you're an asshole, and I can understand your frustration, but there is part of your argument that doesn't ring true to me.

He's not forcing you to keep your current job (unless he's somehow explicitly requested this). You can look for other things. You can even quit and figure out how to support yourself in the meantime.

If you say you can't do the latter, then that would presumably be true if you were on your own, without him. Thus blaming and resenting him for that is misdirected anger. You may be projecting your own career frustration on to him.

You have options. You have free will. If you feel this strongly about changing careers, discuss it with him. Don't put conditions on it or wait for him to do the thing you think he's supposed to do. Discuss, and then act.

While his choices might not be great ones, the one thing he is doing that you aren't is acting.

That being typed, perhaps he needs to learn that you two are now a family and need to behave like a single-unit.  Quitting a job is a big decision with a massive impact on both of you, not just him.

Maybe the next time he starts working at a place you *can* quit your job and take some time to work toward getting a job you won't hate.  If he always feels like he has a safety-net he might always jump.  Maybe he won't be so rash without that net.",Human

I don't think this is a valid criticism/argument. Part of OP's worries are centered around stability for successful planning for the future. If the husband isn't willing to bear that responsibility, *someone else* needs to. Planning for the future requires sacrifice, including staying in a job that isn't ideal (because e alternative, unemployment, is substantially less ideal). With the husband playing hopscotch across jobs, there is no guarantee that his good luck won't come to an end. Who's to say the next time he quits won't be his last? And then if OP is jobless at the same time, this couple finds themselves in serious shit.

The husband isn't explicitly asking her to stay on this job. But his actions are signaling to OP that his desires are for her to stay there.",Human
4fyuff,"You guys need marriage counselling. A marriage is as much a financial partnership as much as a romantic one, and you have good reason to be resentful IMO. That being said resentment is relationship poison, and the whole situation needs to be dealt with proactively. I think he's going to have to take a good hard look at himself and figure out what his priorities in life are. Hopefully you and your marriage figure high on that list.",Human
4fyuff,"I agree with most of what you're saying. However, the second half of the point I was making was that she would still have to do all of that in order to support herself, even if he weren't around. Unless he is racking up significant expenses that his income isn't covering (possible), then OP, in this regard, is exactly where she would be if she were by herself: feeling like she has to keep a job she doesn't want. So resenting him for that may not be 100% valid.

I'm not saying this is a *fair* arrangement, mind you. I get why she would be frustrated and angry. And you may be completely right that the husband may want her to stay where she is, even if he hasn't said as much. But even if he wants that, it doesn't mean that's what she's forced to do. 

She has choices she can make. Keep separate finances/savings accounts. Set a deadline for when she's going to quit her job and go back to school. Look for a better/better paying job in her current industry until she can save enough to get out. Sacrifice her expensive hobby in order to save.

I'm not saying any of that is easy. But she doesn't *have* to keep doing what she's doing. She's blaming and resenting her husband for her own inaction. And he may very well not be making things any easier for her, but ultimately her decisions/indecisions are hers, and she should own that part of it.

Just because somebody is there a lot doesn't mean they need to start paying rent.

Nice enough of him to help pay the bills to be honest.",Human
4g1kro,"It probably comes down to how you ""sat them down"" If the three of you talked in advance about things and came into it with what you wanted then yes, you are the assholes. It's not a dialogue if you sit them down and give them an ultimatum. If you did it like this, then you very much ganged up on him and your other roommate. The boyfriend is already paying some bills, which is more than most would do, he was doing right by you and then you got greedy and wanted more. If he's sleeping in her room, and eating his or her food, then he doesn't owe you anything. Now yes, 5-7 days a week is a lot, but that's how dating works when it starts to get serious. 

You should have just sat down your roommate, just one of you with her and talked about things, it would have gone much better. ",Human
4g1kro,He moved back home? So that means he was actually living there. If he didn't have another place then he was full time living there and you aren't the assholes.,Human
4g1kro,"Yes. Even if you stopped using anything in the flat, you would still have free access to it (you want him to pay rent, but not have a key??), and you would still have your own private room, which is what the rent is paying for. It's not like she or he is getting extra space out of this.

What it sort of sounds like is you guys didn't take the time to think through whether or not you could afford this place that you hadn't even looked at (which doesn't make you an asshole) and are pushing some of that panic onto someone who is essentially a bystander (which sort of does make you an asshole) - who sounds like a nice, respectable bystander who actually took the initiative to pay for his fair share of expenses.

Edit: spelling and words",Human
4g1kro,"This. If he is not paying rent elsewhere but is living at your place then he is a tenant. He is an asshole who clearly can't afford to pay rent so should be living at home.  
Maybe a full 5th of the rent isn't fair but usually a double occupancy means a share and a half of rent as well as two shares of bills. 
Although your friend may have felt ganged up on but she should freaking know that her boyfriend may be welcome but he shouldn't outstay his welcome and if they want to shack up, they should either work out an agreement or find their own place.

",Human
4g1kro,"I don't think you are the asshole. You didn't ask for a 5th roommate and that's what he has become. Even if he is sleeping in his girlfriends room that is still an extra person always in your house that you actually pay rent for, not him.",Human
4g1kro,"Obviously if he began to pay a share then he would get a key, I just meant that he currently doesn't have one. 

There's no panic to do with being able to afford the flat (no panic to do with anything actually), and since we were all friends before we took the word of the one who did see that flat and it actually is really nice and we are happy here, so there's no problems to do with needing money and looking for someone to get it from. 

Our issue is that he is living in the flat, and yeah he's not getting his own room but he is still living here and our opinion is that if you live someone then you pay for it.

4g1kro,"not the asshole

i thought it was standard practice for couples sharing a room to pay a slight increase in rent?  that's what most places i've lived have done. 

it makes sense. lets say your house rent is $2000, so each bedroom is $500. that's assuming each bedroom has an occupant with equal access to common space/amenities. now if one of the bedrooms houses two occupants, that's a bigger strain on common spaces and amenities. 

""not a big deal, i bring my own food and haven't moved a bunch of stuff over."" 

doesn't matter. he's still one more person using space in the fridge, he's one more person tracking dust in on his shoes. the trash fills up faster. toilet paper disappears faster. if he has his own car, it's taking up regular space on your street making it potentially more difficult for the rest of you to park nearby. 

one more person to hog up the bathroom first thing in the morning.  

one more face to have to look at when you're having a bad day.  

i dunno, in some houses everyone has differing schedules and there's not much overlap in use of amenities. then maaaaybe they could squeak by with just chipping in on utilities. 

but if you've ever had to wait for him to finish taking a shit so you could go brush your teeth, or if you've ever had to park two blocks away and his car is across the street from your house, or if you needed to use the big pot for stew and he's using it for something else.  

if any of that stuff happens, his not having a key is a formality. ",Human

I'm firmly on the ground that you're not the asshole here. Someone staying with their SO constantly is using electricity, water, etc. It's just common sense they should at least share utilities. ",Human
4g1kro,"He is either at ours or at his parents, but he is not paying rent anywhere else at the moment.

4g1kro,"Some of his mail was delivered to our flat, yes. He didn't have a key but if he were to start paying then we would have given him a key. He was sharing utilities, but we were asking for a share of rent on top of that",Human
4g1kro,If he has mail delivered then he lives there and should pay for the privilege. ,Human
4g1kro,So do you think that that is one of the main points for our side if this were discussed again?,Human
4g1kro,Absolutely! He is giving people/companies that address meaning he doesn't call another place his primary residence. He should pay his share in utilities and they should pay a little more rent. Not necessarily two people's share but it should be expected that they pay more. ,Human
4g1kro,"Would you be expecting him and the girlfriend to pay more? If not, I don't really see why you'd even care. Let her ask him to pay rent. 

And if you're expecting them to pay more, I'm not sure I agree with that either. They're not getting any extra room for the money than what they have now, and they'll be living on top of each other in one room. Especially if she has an en suite so it's not even affecting bathroom timings.",Human
4g1kro,"Well, if there is no shortage of money, then it just *sounds* like some kind of power trip, by you trying to force someone to conform to what you think they should be doing purely on principle, regardless of actual consequences to you (or anyone else) and at the possible of expense of what sounds like several good relationships. You are all paying money for a room. They don't get an extra room. That's all there is to it.

(I should mention that my thinking on this has changed over the years. I remember being indignant on behalf of a friend when she had to pay half the rent with three people in the house.)",Human
4g1kro,"I think that them paying rent and a half (between them as a couple) would be a fair arrangement from our point of view. That way they are each still paying less than the three other people in the flat, but everyone is that way contributing to living there.

To be honest the reason we tried to have the conversation as the five of us was to figure exactly that out. To look at our options for payment and find something that made everyone happy. Unfortunately it didn't work out like that",Human
4g1kro,"I would disagree that it is a power trip, if it were just me who had the issue, and if I were forcing people and being aggressive then fair enough to the power trip comment. But since three out of the four tenants are unhappy we felt it was something that needed to be at least talked about as a group. Although it would not have major consequences on us, there was a good point made on another comment thread, if the three of us all had girlfriends move in and we therefore had eight people living there, by that logic they wouldn't have to pay for anything, which to me seems ridiculous.

I also want to point out that the fact we are all paying the same rate at the moment negates the fact that we are paying for a room. The rooms in the flat are NOT equal in size or worth and should really be paid for in differing amounts. Because we are paying the same, I see it more as we are paying for a quarter of the entire flat, and therefore if there are five people in the flat as a whole, it should be split that way.

That being said, I do see your point when it doesn't affect us in a substantial way",Human
4g1kro,"the asshole is the person who is living in the place and not paying rent.  All these people saying ""well, it depends on how you spoke to them"" - that's just not the case.  From what you are describing the guy was living there 80-90% of the time.  Sorry, I'm not going to be nice about letting him know he is welcome to stay - so long as he is paying rent.",Human
4g1kro,"What would the landlord do if he/she knew there was another person living there?  Probably want that person on the lease for legal reasons, so yeah he needs to pay rent.

Also, the flatmate who is mad that he moved back home should probably head on over to /r/relationships to get some feedback on dating an overgrown mama's boy who apparently wants everybody else to take care of him, instead of him being self sufficient. 

But anyway, they might have been endangering all of you, because the landlord might not be cool with that arrangement, and could evict all of you or not renew your lease. ",Human
4g1kro,"Ah. If the sizes of the rooms are very different, you guys definitely shouldn't be splitting the rent equally. I emphasized ""sounds like"" because I don't think it's that extreme, but it sounds like a situation where it could easily slide in that direction. There *is* a possibility that a majority can get themselves a little riled up and villainize another single person or smaller group of people. I only say this from experience in these situations.

This wasn't an issue in the last place where my boyfriend stayed (I only visited him for two or three days every month, by the way) because the landlord was the person who decided how much each person paid in rent based on room size. There were a few couples who moved in, and it didn't change anything about anyone else's rent situation. I don't think anyone even gave it a second thought.",Human
4g1kro,"I think that you shouldn't have involved him in this directly, just brought it up with her.  She's the one on the lease, she's the one renting the room, she's the one you should be dealing with.",Human
4g1kro,"As long as he does his household share and pays his share of the bills, I think that should suffice for any use of the ""public areas"".

For the rest, he's occupying the same room as his girlfriend, so if the girlfriend pays full rent for that it should be okay IMO. It's not uncommon to think of rent as payment for a bedroom that's ""your own"", and all the other bills+household tasks as ""payment"" for the common areas and object and services you use.

I don't think you're an (necessarily) asshole for bringing it up, but I also think it's good to leave it as it is now.",Human
4g1kro,"Yes, that's an asshole thing to do. He's not on the lease and the thing to do would be request that he not stay over as often instead of asking for rent money. It's cool that he paid utilities. That he had his mail delivered there is weird but is really not relevant to the fact that you're asking someone not in a rental agreement to pay rent. I can totally see where you were coming from, trying to find a solution that allowed him to in effect stay there as much as he wanted, but it's a bad idea borne of financial and interpersonal stress. Being less accommodating to him would have been better.",Human

Or maybe he's just someone who wants to live with his girlfriend but can't afford to pay rent?",Human
4g1kro,"I get that leaving money out of it would have been more ideal, but the problem with being less accommodating is that he is the boyfriend of a flatmate and therefore we felt we had more of a right to ask for rent than say you have to stop coming round.

4g1kro,"We did bring it up with her originally and she said she had been expecting it and was surprised we hadn't brought it up sooner.

Your lease agreement may have some rule about guests where they must be considered full-time renters if they stay beyond a certain amount of time. If that is the case, I think he definitely should pay rent (I think your proposal of 1.5x rent for the couple is fair) or stay less than the specified time.

The fact that he lives with his parents instead of paying for his own place is irrelevant. He still has another address.

Well, the other comments have called you out on this already. So I'm not going to comment as it is a minor detail on the actual story.

Why would you do this first instead of doing this:

&gt; ask him why he changed?

Since you were hostile with each other, I think you'd have an idea why this occured: 

&gt; he begins to spread rumers about me, still Idk why.

Another asshole thing you did.

&gt; I became real good at ignoring him, and I meant REALLY good. 

Now, I take it that you're young and you still have some growing up to do so I'd say most of these ""asshole"" things you've done are because of immaturity. And it's good that you've had time to reflect on it and hopefully realize how you could've acted better in the situation.

&gt; Should I ask him why he changed? Am I the asshole because I stopped taking to him first and kinda ruined the entire group?

You could do those if you wish but you have to be prepared if it doesn't go your way. If doing that wont work, then I hope you accept it (and not be passive-aggressive / immature about it).

Then your reaction. Now don't get me wrong this guy sounds like a fuccboi too. But instead of handling it like an adult, you just go from ignoring it to fighting fire with fire. There's no mature middle ground, just childishness. It's a fuccboiaganza. And even after it gets physical, you still don't really do anything about it. And then you ignore him?

It's quite possible plenty of people have been interested in you but you were oblivious to the signs or ignored them because you thought noone could ever like you. Maybe they were too nervous to talk to you about it - young girls aren't often very good at being straightforward like that. How many girls have you liked but not said anything to because you convinced yourself they'd say no so why bother?

You're not an asshole for avoiding a friend who you have feelings for. It's been 1.5 years so it's not turning out to be a short-lived crush, so if you want a chance of getting over her, then you should have very little contact with her, to give yourself a better chance to move on.

But, you would be an asshole for just ghosting on two friends. I understand it's hard for you to talk to the girl about your feelings. So, at least talk to the guy. Ask him if they're in a relationship - if he says yes, explain why this situation keeps confronting you with your own feelings and that it would be better for you to back off for a while.

It's easy to say there's more to life than sex when it's happened for you. Sure there's more to it, but it's not like it's completely unimportant.

You're believing in the classic fallacy of depression: things have been like this so far, that means they will always be that way. I believed that too. Except that's very rarely true; things change. Sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes indifferent, but they don't stay the same forever. Believing that they'll stay the same is contrary to reality. That makes your belief inaccurate at best, illogical at worst.

I understand what you mean about being bad at being a person. But ""being a person"", as you describe, is a learnable skill. It's not a preprogrammed genetic ability. Sure, different people find it easier than others, but it can be improved upon by everyone. Thus, where you are now doesn't have to reflect where you can/will be. That's not a platitude I'm spewing at you -- you practice something, you get better at it. That's a fact. 

On to ""ugliness"": I don't know you, maybe you truly are hideously ugly. But I doubt it. Do people shy away from you on the street because you are so malformed or repulsive? That's what ""hideously ugly"" would be. Or are you just average, or even just below average looking? That's not the same thing. Yes, being good looking makes it easier to meet people than not, and maybe you're not. That would make it harder. Not impossible. Ugly people find relationships, too.

http://www.llttf.com/ has some examples you can listen to in the space of 10 minutes, if I remember correctly - if you want to get a rough idea of how it works. Some of it sounds a bit patronising though.

&gt;What's learned helplessness

Well in your situation it pretty much means you've resigned yourself to your 'fate' and feel that it's useless to try and get out of it because you don't think anything you do will ever fix it. 

Normally someone feels like this because of another situation they have been in where nothing they do seems to help - it's common in things like depression (especially chronic depression) where it takes a while to find the treatments that work for you and your energy to try is sapped.

There's an anecdotal story sometimes used in motivational pictures that has a similar theme - adult elephants are restrained by flimsy chains around their feet. Someone asks their trainer why they don't break free and he answers that they chained them up when they were young and couldn't break free, no matter how they tried. Way before the time they got to adulthood they gave up trying, so now even though they could break the chain easily they won't attempt to.",Human
4ghpcw,Then I guess my only advice on that front is to try and focus on you. Get your depression sorted out and try to take care of yourself. It's a lot easier for people to like you if you like yourself.,Human
4ghpcw,I agree with this. I also get not wanting to be around disgustingly happy relationship people when you're feeling bad about being single - been there. The best antidote is getting out and doing other things / seeing other friends who make you feel good without focusing on what's missing. This is also good for depression.,Human
4ghpcw,"Everyone is not having great lives. Everyone is not in happy with their fulfilling relationships. Everyone has not had sex. If you admit that there is more than life to sex, why not focus on those other parts? Don't use women to measure your worth as a human being.

Twenty is not some crazy age to still be a virgin or to not have had your first kiss. If it seems like you're the only one, it's only because the other guys aren't talking about it. You're not an outlier.

I think you should work on your self esteem. The idea that people would mock you behind your back is not really how people are in real life, women are not mean high school girl stereotypes. I just don't think this happens with normal people who have an ounce of respect for others. This scenario is your fear talking.

I know you said you tried therapy but it sounds like you didn't click with the therapist and six sessions is not much at all. You are struggling with some really serious and painful emotions and it is going to take some time to grow strong, but that's okay. If I had quit therapy after my first therapist (who was terrible!) or after my first couple of medications and didn't keep searching for the right therapist/drug, I can't imagine how massively fucked up I'd be now.

As far as I can tell, he's NOT, but I can definitely see him having a little bit of a struggle with himself.  You being mad at him for it (which you totally have the right to feel) may have put him in an overly defensive position given the circumstances.   

I think that feeling guilty can sometimes lead to feelings of anger because somehow in order to protect ourselves from the weird guilt we place ON OURSELVES,  we get mad at the person we hurt.

Your previous encounter obviously influenced this. Is it possible that you unintentionally insulted the guy, or perhaps you have poor social graces?

I actually thought I may have insulted him by asking about his form. I actually apologized after he told me to fuck off. I didn't think it was notable to add due to the nature of following events. I'm unsure as what you mean by social graces but I'm sure my further responses will give insight. As stated it escalated from asking a question to following events. It is as written. I left out minor details, like listing each time because it would be monotomous and instead chose to give a summary that fit all instances.

What this seems to imply is that my response should have been trying to act in a tough demeanor and confront him. I feel as if this would lead to him escalating matters further right there. In my opinion this was not a desirable approach. I believe any individual could understand that people do not appreciate the actions he was carrying out and would thus believe that they should halt them or atleast talk to the person. His actions, in my opinion, seem child-like and for that reason I believed he would behave like such and pursue physical altercation. This was not a desira",Human
4gxrb7,"&gt; What this seems to imply is that my response should have been trying to act in a tough demeanor and confront him. 

If you have a problem with a man, you should be man enough to work it out with him.  Going to a higher authority over something as small as a bitter remark directed towards yourself suggests that you would have rather run to the authority and have the guy punished instead of just dealing with the situation yourself.  Did you even confront him and ask why he's being a dick, or did you just go rat him out? Did you try to reason with him? Did you ever try to rectify the situation without going to rat him out?

&gt; His actions, in my opinion, seem child-like and for that reason I believed he would behave like such and pursue physical altercation

If that's the case, then you almost certainly did something that insulted him, and you seem oblivious to this fact.  Is it possible that you misinterpreted his initial actions towards you, and is it possible that you are at least somewhat responsible for the way he reacted to your social interactions?  I find it very difficult to believe that somebody would become so belligerent to a relative stranger based on what you described.  You seem to be leaving out pertinent information, and that information is likely what made you the target of his aggression.

&gt; I felt like I went the best route possible by talking to the people in charge of the facility after multiple altercations ensued. 

If it happened more than once",Human
4gxrb7,Not the asshole at all. And the text wasn't horrible. People just like to complain. ,Human

4gxrb7,"A) Minor detail left out. After his original reaction, roughly a month or so later after being cussed at a few times, he was standing around with his headphones off and I though I could start of with a compliment and then try to talk to him. I led in with ""Hey, can I talk to you for a minute"" to be responded to with once again ""Fuck off and leave me alone"". I attempted to solve the problem and was met with hostility. Later that week was when he threatened physical violence. I NEVER involved the administration until threats of physical violence was imposed.

B) I feel as if he could have taken my question about lat pull downs as an insult. I comprehend that was wrong to due. I figured from there I should just leave him alone and what not. He responded further with cussing me out for looking in his direction. 

C) I have no idea why he behaved in such a negative way. If I knew so I would attempt to repair the situation.

D) I actually waited to ask him until he was finished with his training session. I did not ask my question in the format ""Aren't you supposed to do it like ..."" or a similar way. I recall exactly how I worded it because I am conscious of the fact that people would take offense to that. I asked him why he preformed the movement the way he did. I figured this way proposed less of a negative connotation than the aforementioned. Note: Less not None.

I understand that I am not perfect or innocent in this situation. If I had not approached him there may not be any c",Human

You are responsible for you. You can't be responsible for your parents' response to this situation. ",Human
4h12sv,"In the long run you will be happier. There is no law that says you have to like your your parents. And despite what a lot of people say, you owe you mother nothing. You should find a way to keep in contact with your dad since he shouldn't be punished for her actions, but not if it puts you back in a bad situation. 

Remember, guilt is one of an emotionally abusive parent's greatest weapons. Once you realize that it actually has no true power over you, you will find the ""battles"" much easier to win or walk away from.

In that case. Unless you have a(n) (verbal) agreement with your friend or it is expected by him that you act in a certain way, you shouldn't feel bad.

It's hard to guess if you're doing anything wrong when we don't know your friends thoughts on this.

Anyway, I would say don't worry, if you don't want to risk a friendship don't do it. If you don't talk, probably, no one will know.

As it stands right now, you are not an asshole by any definition of the word, as you haven't done anything wrong by your account. Now if accepting nudes would be seen as wrong. Maybe by actively accepting you're crossing the don't-touch-my-sister border, but this isn't always the standard.",Human

2. Yeah, you'd definitely be the asshole. There's no way he wouldn't end up knowing because it's something that could really hurt him emotionally and everyone who knows the secret has potential to be in a situation where they'd want badly enough to hurt him that they'd be willing to spill the beans, and that's not even considering the risk of him being suspicious or finding out accidentally. Sooner or later, he's gonna know. It may even be something she tells him when you're all 40 and it's long past but he still probably won't be thrilled to hear you betrayed his trust like that. So now the question is whether the nudes are worth probably losing a 3 year friendship over. Are you planning on the friendship ending when he moves away regardless of what else happens? Or are you planning on still being friends? If you'd still be friends otherwise, you're an asshole for ruining a friendship by betraying a friend's trust and violating his boundaries just because you want to see a specific set of tits. If you weren't planning on staying friends regardless, you're an asshole for betraying a friend's trust and violating his boundaries just because you wanted to see a specific set of tits.

To reiterate, I realize that parking in a spot that isn't yours is an asshole move and that I was well within my rights to tow. I'm just not completely clear on what the etiquette on towing right away is, since it's gonna cost that dude a couple hundred bucks and a few hours of his life to get his car back. It could have been an emergency on their part (though more likely it was a dipshit that just didn't want to pay for parking.)",Human

If it were a beater, the towing costs would probably be a huge deal for them and it would be kind of an asshole move to put so much economic burden on someone for making you find parking elsewhere (even though that's super hard to do).

499g66,"Thanks. It's just that he is talking to other people about this and coming back to us with this shitty attitude, so we wanted feedback from a group of people who aren't our friends and don't have friend bias.  Reddit is great for that. ",Human

499g66,"Its totally relevant. Giving overweight people different sets of rules to live by drives me nuts. Just because he weighs 300 lbs isn't your problem. If other roommates have used that toilet, and even shower, the cost of that room should be the same for everyone and reflect having your own bath. But really maybe you could've seen this coming when you rented him the room guessing he can't fit into his bath.

I'm not saying that your apartment shouldn't be clean, I'm just saying that you seem to want it to be sparkling clean, while most people would be content with standard clean. This isn't a problem, but you need to understand that other people don't always agree with how dirty some place is, and whether or not it needs to be cleaned. Maybe your bathroom isn't actually dirty to most people, but it is to you. This is something you need to sit down and discuss with your roommates, otherwise they won't change their attitude.

He was living with his parents while he was separated from his wife, but he started to officially pursue divorce he wanted out of his parents' house. We offered him a room with us to be kind and give him a nice place to be himself while he goes through divorce. 

Honestly, it's starting to become kinda clear why a divorce might've occurred between what he's told us about her and how he's been treating us. ",Human
499g66,"Other roomie dude. We hold the lease, he doesn't. If he doesn't want to adhere to our standard of cleanliness, then he can use his own private bathroom instead.

499g66,"That's why I said discuss it thoroughly with him dude. Your standards, while totally okay because they're what you want to live in, might not be the same as the average person. So you need to explain in detail to your roommate exactly what you expect/want. Otherwise his standards of clean probably won't line up with your super high standards of clean. Just fucking talk to him about it (and don't gang up on him like you two are ganging up on people in this thread).",Human

It would be one thing if it was just that, but when he doesn't contribute to that, and THEN wants to talk about not paying for other things, I feel like he needs to be reminded of the things he uses and doesn't pay for. 

If he wants to nickel and dime us, we'll start counting the pennies.",Human
499g66,"We have. We explained how we like things cleaned BEFORE he moved in, and he agreed. I even gave him a list of what we expect, and he agreed. 

We got so frustrated with him that we eventually said ""you know what don't worry about it"" and he has been shitting like a king in this apartment with his roommates buying his shit tickets and cleaning his shit out of our toilet. 

THEN he wants to talk about what he shouldn't have to pay though?? While we spent the last 4 months literally cleaning up his shit and buying stuff he didn't contribute to? 

So when he started to cry about $20 in utilities, we decided to remind him that he should be buying toilet paper and cleaning. We also discussed charging him a ""cleaning fee"", but figured that was too petty.

Can the two who want to keep the Xbox buy out the other two? Do they still use it for DVD/Blu-ray/Netflix? Or in a capacity other than gaming? If so being bought out would lose them that access.

They would definitely be assholes for selling it without your consent. But I also think you and the the other person could work out a way to buy them out. Either cash upfront, a few pounds a  week, or do chores for them, or barter for the remaining share.

It's a pretty petty thing to tear a group apart (I don't know how close your relationship is with these people either).",Human
49hx5g,"It's the fact that we bought it as a group, and the status quo has always been that there has been an Xbox in the front room.

Do you see where I'm coming from? Plus the fact it is currently a 50/50 split in terms of opinion.",Human
49hx5g,"From their point of view though, it's money they can't get because it's tied up in a console they don't use. Financially, I think both sides have even cause, so you'll have to find a non-financial solution.

Do they still use the Xbox for things other than gaming? Explaining to them that forcing a buy out would include them losing ALL access to it might help.",Human
49hx5g,"Thing is, we all agreed to split it and buy it together, and the other two people stopped using it. They agreed to split the cost and they can't just randomly change their minds now that it's turned out they don't use it as much as they thought they would. 

My point in regard to spending ""extra"" money in terms of the buyout is that the point of selling the Xbox has just been brought up, I realise that I would get that back at the end of the year, but if we were to buy them out now it would be seen as an unforeseen expenditure.

I would be down £50 in terms of actual cash that I wouldn't get back until the end of the year. When it's sold, and that's why I feel the buyout option is somewhat unfair

In short: both solutions are technically ""fair"", but if the people using the Xbox aren't willing to buy them out, then it's their problem... it seems fair that I shouldn't be obligated to pay them early just because they decided they don't want to use it anymore.",Human

49hx5g,"I feel like you have a strong view on this and aren't really listening to peoples opinions.

In my opinion, you either need to sell the Xbox and split the money, or you and your friend (who use it) need to buy their shares from them.

Your friends own half the console, and therefore have every right to claim there share back. If you don't co-operate, you are the asshole",Human

But they don't have that right though, the agreement was a 4 way split, I feel like they need to suck up their loss, it isn't fair for the two still using it to have to pay just because the other two abandoned their purchase.

Essentially, they're trying to back out of the deal by ""selling"" their quater",Human

Everyone has exactly what they agreed to.On the other hand, if it gets sold then it's you who loses out, and not them. You lose your entertainment, any games or accessories you bought for the console become useless, and you'll presumably get less cash back than it cost you in the first place.They're being selfish here.

I just feel that it seems fairer to sell it at that point, when nobody is playing it, everyone consents to selling it (as we bought it together), and we'r not being asked to be without the money for that period of time.",Human

The two others will still get their fair share. ",Human
49hx5g,"Yes, advice from people who don't have a dog in the race is the best way to solve this. Are you going to show them this thread?

I gave this a lot of thought, from all sides. Here is what I think this boils down to.

* This is a retail purchase, which serves a household utility need. *It is NOT an investment.* 

Investments and household purchases are treated in two totally different ways. With investments, yes, you consider when they no longer serve benefit, when to cash out and maximize returns on the commodity and so on. 

But, that's not how household purchases work. If you all bought silverware together and 2 roommates went on a liquid diet it would NOT be okay to sell all the forks.

To the roommates, I feel you, I'm a PC gamer too. But, If you are being honest, you acknowledge the silverware analogy is true. You wouldn't sell the forks. Selling forks because you eat only eat soup is silly, right? The only reason you feel it is different is because of the *amount* of money. 

I got you. But, the amount of money is irrelevant. Because, this isn't an investment. You've all pooled to buy a household resource. The resource should stand until the household is dissolved or all parties agree otherwise. 

You should not get bought out now. Because the xbox will depreciate by the time the lease is over. You should get bought out, at the end of the lease, at around that time's market value. 

You lost some money, okay. But, again, purchases aren't investments. And, if you try to ",Human
49hx5g,"Sorry but who says they have that right? It was a four way purchase made over a year ago, if they had bought it between the two of them they would be stuck with it the same. They don't magically get refunded for their purchase. Why should the other two have to pick up their shit because they made a bad decision?",Human
49hx5g,"This is a retail purchase. Their problems stem from trying to transform it into an investment months after the fact. That's not how things work. You don't get to buy a dishwasher and then suddenly say, I don't want it - roommates buy my shares. You can't trade a household good. This is a purchase not an investment.

When the household dissolves, in 4 months, then they can get rid of their joint purchases, fairly. ",Human
49hx5g,"I don't think anyone is the asshole here.

To use the household items vs investment analogy that another commenter brought up, I think of it this way. Sure, you might be irritated if the roommate that went on an all liquid diet decided to sell the forks. But at the same time, if they aren't using the forks, they would feel irritated that they went halfsies on something you now basically retain 100% ownership of. In today's world, it's not that weird to sell your forks on craigslist, so household items have become things that can be bought and sold, they're just less liquid in terms of equity than a stock or bond or something. 

In this situation with the forks, and also as it applies to your situation, if you want to retain ownership and take away their rights to sell, you need to buy out their ownership. Really, that's what would make everyone the most happy. You get to keep the xbox, they get to relinquish their ownership. From what I'm hearing, you just want to keep the xbox and not have to pay more for it. But really, you aren't being forced to pay more. You have a choice of getting money back (selling) or paying extra to keep playing, in either case you'd be getting money back in 4 months. The other two are being forced to give up the money they spent on the xbox, because they can't get money back and you won't buy them out. They lost their choice because you don't want to budge either way.

That being said, there is no way that the xbox would sell currently for as much ",Human
49hx5g,"They don't have every right to claim their share back. They have every right to start using it again, sure, but they can't just cash out as if they'd bought shares in Microsoft. Same as, if I'm short of cash, I can't just decide to stop using the sandwich toaster and then demand that my housemate reimburses me for the half I paid for it.",Human
49hx5g,"/u/Asizeableflav is right, selling the xbox isn't fair to you two as you now no longer have an xbox that you planned on having and buying them out for £50 isn't fair because they will still have some use of the xbox and you do not want to get into the ""you aren't allowed to use the xbox anymore"" game. So here's what you do. Negotiate a buy out of their shares and settle on a price. They want to get out early, fine, but they have to do it in a way everybody is happy with. Offer them £20 each for their share of the xbox. Now at the end of the year you have half an xbox worth £100 instead of a quarter at £50. If you can agree on a price everyone is happy with great, if not keep the status quo until you can agree on something. ",Human

No one forced them to buy it. It is no different eh an a y other kid of buyer's remorce. The thing that is different is the want to sell it to get some.money back. Too bad. They own or with other people. They can't make all the decision for the product. If they don't want to play then don't play. They are out money the same as they would be if they bought a game.they didn't like. You shouldn't have to pay their share to keep it because you already paid your share for it.

I don't think that it's reasonable to just sell the thing if two people are still using it, but it does seem fair for the users to cash out the non-users in advance and then split the returns among themselves when it's actually sold. Remember, you're only spending the extra money temporarily. You'll get it back when you sell the Xbox.",Human
49hx5g,"But do you not think it is unfair that the two want to sell it, have their money tied up in this console which they do not want?",Human

49hx5g,"Everyone here is justified in what they want to do, although pulling out of an arrangement like this is slightly dickish. As of now, including depreciation (sounds like 200 is the current used market price in whatever city you're in). It would be fair to force them to stay on, and it would also be fair to buy them out. I would go with the buying out option because, while it allows slightly dickish behaviour, you two get greater access to the console. And imagine if it broke after this time, it would almost definitely be the two users' fault. But if you don't buy them out and just keep it until it's ready to sell, the two non-users also lose their share, or you can buy them out then. And besides, when you sell it the two users get more money. It's just a matter of when the money is in whose hands.

tl;dr Buy them out. It's not the most morally correct thing, but it resolves a lot of complications. You don't really lose out on money/benefit anyway.",Human
49hx5g,"As far as the wantingtosell-ers are concerns, your wanting not to sell is asking them to be without the money for that period of time. 

I'm not saying your position is wrong, but your argument is shit.",Human
49hx5g,I had a similar dilemma between my siblings when we started moving out of the house/going to college. We decided one person could buy out the others. Essentially just pay them their share of the xbox. Now its not their problem anymore and you can have more control over it. They don't get to play it without your permission.,Human
49hx5g,"This is a fantastic breakdown of the situation.  I think the clarification between investment and purchase is an important distinction, and I love the fork analogy.  I agree, if they want to buy OP out, they can do that, but you can't expect to pay what you did at the time.  It's not worth that now, they can't expect that kind of return, if one at all.  

Check the prices on eBay a couple weeks before it's time to move out, and find something in your country that has the same accessories it would be sold with (minus anything individuals have purchased, that should not be factored in), and split that 4 ways.  If they want that money right now, they're being assholes, and should just ask to borrow the funds, as they're likely just strapped for cash.",Human

I was in a similar situation and we fixed it pretty well. When one of my roommates wanted to sell something that we bought together, I agreed to pay him either: 1. 50% of whatever he paid, to account for depreciation (in the case of a couch) or 2. Whatever %  of the amount it was selling for on eBay. Everybody was happy with that solution",Human
49lzko,"You're not an asshole for suggesting that, since you are just trying to look out for the cat's wellbeing (as well as that of your brother in the long run).

However, you need to realize that some people do not like vets, because there are a lot of shady things that can happen. For example, when I was a kid my parents brought our cat to the vet for a checkup, and the vet decided that the cat was sick and needed immediate surgery. So my parents shilled out the massive sum for the surgery, only for the cat to get much much worse after. Eventually the cat had to be put down because of how much pain the surgery had put it in. Ultimately, it turned out that the cat hadn't even been sick in the first place, and the vet was just pushing uneccesary surgeries on families in order to increase their revenue. 

Now, I'm definitely not saying that this is even remotely a common thing, but it does happen. And people are wary of vets for reasons like this, among many others. So basically what I'm saying is that hey probably have their reasons for not wanting to take the cat to the vet unless they feel they have to.",Human
49lzko,"Honestly those symptoms are pretty serious. That cat could be In serious danger. By the time the belly is swollen, it's a huge problem. Male cats are prone to getting urine crystals which can render them unable to pass urine. If left untreated, the bladder can burst and the cat will likely die. 

Sorry if this message panics you, but I'm a vet tech and if somebody called us and described these symptoms I would classify this as an emergency situation. I feel so bad for that cat, he is probably in serious pain. Get off the internet and take him to a vet unless you're willing to risk his life. ",Human

49lzko,"Cat isn't at my house first off. And he got an auto feeder and he isn't the kind of cat you can free feed.

The biggest problem I have is 1. Cost and 2. I don't have anything concrete. My girlfriend was never a vet or a tech (she worked in kennel and instruments) but helped out a lot and still handled a bunch of sick animals. So there is still the chance she is wrong.
",Human
49lzko,"I'm not sure what you mean by the feeding comment. Crystals are not to my knowledge known to be caused by overeating, rather, they are due to the way that the body stores the vitamins/minerals in the food. If he is being fed a low quality food, this can make crystals more likely to occur as well as just being a male cat in general as they are more prone to it. 

I understand cost, but honestly it is no excuse. When someone owns an animal, they need to anticipate costly vet care. Unfortunately, that is just part of life. You can apply for Care Credit, which is an interest-free credit service for veterinary care. You can also ask the hospital if they will do any kind of financing for you. 

And that's cool about your girlfriend. I am telling you, as a person who has worked in the kennel, reception, and currently as a vet tech, that these are signs of possible bladder rupture due to not being able to pass urine completely. They can also be serious signs of other disorders. Would you rather be wrong and spend $30-50 on an exam fee, or risk the cat dying? The least you could do is take it to the vet. If it turns out to need very expensive medical care, then surrender the cat to a no kill shelter so it can get emergency vet care, and an owner that can afford vet treatment when necessary for the future.",Human
49lzko,"I brought the feeder bit in due to him being large and it could just be fat.

And I fully agree with you that the owner should anticipate vet costs...but I'm not the owner and this would be going behind her back and fucking with her animal. And to add some context, she thinks that I am trying to take something out on her cat (by trying not to have it die a slow, painful death) because I'm trying to get back at her or some shit.

Sometimes saying ""shit dude, that really sucks"" and buying them a beer is better than saying ""I've got the answer to your problems it's so easy"". 

I would tentatively put you in the asshole category, just for the slight lack of empathy.

",Human
49p298,"You seem like an asshole. Ask yourself if your responses are the responses you would want to receive if you were in their shoes.  Everything in your post is about your feelings, with little regard to those of your friends.  Additionally your word choice reveals that you don't really seem to care about their problems, for example they 'bitch' about things, and they want 'an echo chamber'.  Their issues become arguments for you to win. When you insult them, and they tell you, you don't apologize, because for you being 'right' is more important than being kind.  Not to mention that you so strongly assume that you have the correct answer during these occassions.  But you are here questioning your behavior, so there is hope for you.  Just try and sit quietly and listen next time.  Often the solution to a friend's problem is just showing some compassion. ",Human
49p298,"To put it simply, yes, you are the asshole.

You don't need to necessarily lie, but you should be socially aware. Sometimes people don't want your opinion. They see things the way they see them, and you are just instigating conflict. Sometimes you just need to be more tactful in the way you provide dissenting opinion. There are thoughtful and persuasive ways of voicing your thoughts that won't be taken as judgmental or attacking. And sometimes if it is a serious, dangerous matter frank opinions need to be given regardless of how they make people feel.

It is up to you to figure out how you want to be around people. It takes some experimentation, and we all screw up occasionally. If you find that you are pissing people off regularly just for having differing opinions then it is likely something you are doing. I would suggest evaluating your presentation.

If in the morning you meet an asshole, then ok, you just met an asshole. If you find that you are meeting assholes throughout the day then you are the asshole.

49p298,"Yeah, you're the asshole. You need to understand that sometimes, your friends are just looking to vent and get validation. I'm a fix-it person too so I get that it's hard to listen to a problem and not try to come up with a solution but sometimes that's what people want and if they're people you care about, you're going to have to learn to deal with that discomfort. If you're not sure if that's what they want, ask! A simple ""are you looking for a shoulder or for advice?"" should do the trick as long as you use an appropriate tone, ie not one that implies that just wanting a shoulder is a bad thing. I think part of the problem is that you're looking at it as an ""echo chamber"" rather than support. You can let people vent and validate their experiences without being a yes-man. If I say ""I had a really rough day today. Work was super chaotic and I'm stressed out about a situation with my family and on top of that I got home and just wanted some ice cream but when I opened the little carton I realized I had eaten all but a few spoonfuls a week ago and then forgotten about it."" you don't have to say ""wtf your job should treat you better and fuck your family for stressing you out and it's so unfair that you don't have ice cream!"" You can just say ""That sucks, I'm sorry you're having a shitty day!"" You don't need to determine exactly how busy work was that day and whether it counts as chaotic and whether their stress is justified and whether it's their fault. You are not tacitly endor",Human
49p298,"You're an asshole. 

I can assume you're probably coming off as rude depending on how you address a situation. Stop being so competitive, you don't have to win absolutely everything. It just makes you look like an asshole.  If you're insulting someone, that makes you an asshole. Perhaps a more political approach to these types of discussions would benefit you. ",Human
49p298,"Almost definitely the ass hole, but without details from a specific instance it's impossible to determine the level of ass hole-ness. First of all there's a difference between wanting a shoulder to cry on and an echo chamber. 

Second, not every experience your friends have is a problem you need to solve even if it is a negative experience. ""My boss is a real jerk"", ""My favourite sports team lost"", ""I waited to see the doctor for 2 and a half hours, then he was with me for 5 minutes and just wrote a prescription for antibiotics"" are all examples of things that are important to your friend that they may want to share with you but don't need you to solve. 

Third it sounds like you argue like an ass hole and try and turn everything into an argument, which is not a good combonation.

&gt;Usually this will turn into an argument because they don't agree with how I see the situation.

This is pretty vague but to me it sounds like you think you know more about a situation that you weren't there for than the person who is actually living through said situation (which I can almost assure you, you don't)

In other words you are not a good listener. You don't care if your friends need sympathy or an ear to share their problems. You care about fulfilling your need to ""solve"" things.               
                
&gt;When I argue with someone, I see it as something I can win.              
                      
Again this comes down to not being a good listener. You care about winning which is not the same as caring about the right solution . Sometimes there isn't a right or wrong and it just comes down to opinion. Sometimes you have to reflect on the opposing position to understand it. If you're focused on winning, then your just looking for holes instead of trying to understand the point. Most people aren't good at   arguing a point on the spot. They may not word their ideas correctly or misremember facts because they haven't gone over them recently. If you try to understand their point instead of picking it apart you can come to understand their perspective.         
                
&gt;My best friend has said that I have certain ""moments"" where my sort of cynical or apathetic side comes out and I say things that hurt him. These things usually come out during an argument with someone and the fact that I don't say sorry.

Not only that, but your friends have something they want to get off their chests, and you argue with them about it. You're apathetic, say hurtful things, refuse to apologize, or even recognize when you've done something wrong. I don't understand how you *don't* think you're an asshole.",Human
49p298,"""I'm nobodies echo chamber"" yeah you're an asshole. Someone's coming to you with a problem and you're making it more about 'look at me I'm a straight to the point kinda guy, no bullshit' than whatever they might be needing at the time, probably sympathy or encouragement. 

Then you go on to say 'I don't like being wrong' and how you see these arguments as competition which is a prime trait of an asshole. Same with your not saying sorry thing, asshole behaviour.

If he raly.is just lazy then that is his problem. He also could be overwhelmed and struggling. College is harder for sone people more than others.

If his not doing the work reflected pool on your grade then I would understand. Since you made sure it wouldn't by talking to the professor, you no longer have a horse in this race. You could tell him what the missing assignment was. You could consider helping him. You don't have to, but if he is really struggling it could mean the world to him.

Calling him ""retarded"" is kind of asshole-ish, but the rest depends on how old this kid is.  

When I read the OP title I was envisioning an elementary school kid, and in that case you should give him some slack.

But you say you're a senior, which suggests this is actually another high school kid. If so, then he should know better, ADHD or not, and they were just being an obnoxious asshole and using their diagnosis as an excuse.

Edit: Thanks for the response. I'm going to say no assholes here. It doesn't seem like you specified to them that you were saving that for yourself, so they probably just thought it was up for grabs. It's a shitty thing to do, eating someone else's pie without at least asking first, but I don't think it's asshole worthy. ",Human
4aiufj,About 5/8 of a pie was left. They ate the remainder and 1 slice of the pumpkin. ,Human
4aiufj,"Eating all the pie was rude, regardless of whether you offered them some the night before or not. Next time, don't offer them any.",Human
4aiufj,"No one is really an asshole here. I wouldn't take the last piece of it unless I was explicitly offered it and I think that's good manners, but not everyone is raised like that. It was most likely not intentionally malicious or selfish - they likely assumed it was fine because you offered. So, yeah, it's shitty and I'd probably put limits on any future offers, e.g. ""you want a slice? Make sure to leave more for me tomorrow though."" But it's *really* not worth getting too upset over. Shake it off, go get more pie.",Human
4aiufj,"Thanks, I think I'm just sick of constantly being told to leave. I have to make myself scarce like constantly around them and it's starting to wear thin to me. ",Human
4aiufj,Eating damn near a whole pie is excessive for sure but I don't think it makes them the asshole since it was offered. On the surface this doesn't seem like a big deal unless there's some history of your brother eating your food all the time. If there is a history then you have some right to be pissed. If this is an isolated incident then I would say you could quickly become the asshole if you get too pissy over a pie that you offered them.,Human
4aiufj,"Having to leave may be a bigger issue. How often do they ask you to leave then alone?
",Human
4aiufj,"Every time she's over, about once a week. They also get upset if I make noise or anything. ",Human
4aiufj,"So, i may be firing blanks here, but are you more annoyed about the pie or the fact that they expect to have free reign of the living room. I have no idea about your situation and my knowledge of roommate etiquette is severely limited. ",Human
4aiufj,"I dunno, people here seem to be declaring no assholes, but I would say OP's brother (and to a lesser extent, the girlfriend) is the asshole. 

If there was only a small piece left and they finished it, I'd say it's fine. But OP estimates that more than half was still left that night. It is not a reasonable assumption on the brother's part that OP's original offer allows for consumption of more than 50% of the pie.

And then for them to also eat a slice of the pumpkin pie - that's just added assholery.  

I mean, it's pie, so probably nothing worth destroying a family over, but as a jury we're called upon to make a judgement, and I think OP's brother needs to be held responsible as the asshole.",Human
4aiufj,"I would have personally assumed it is a one-time offer and not presumed it's mine to eat. I would have asked before I ate more, or resolved to buy you another one if I succumbed to the temptation.",Human
4aiufj,"They really have no right to make you leave common areas of the house at all. If they want privacy they can go to your brother's bedroom. Personally I'd only be OK with leaving common areas for them on special occasions and with advance notice. I think you should stop putting up with that bullshit, unless your brother is covering all/most of the rent or something like that.",Human
4aiufj,2 people ate more than half of a pie?  they are the assholes,Human
4aiufj,"I think the issue is that they declined in the first place.


""Would you like some pie?""



""No, go away.""



Don't eat the fucking pie



""Would you like some pie?""



""Thank you, maybe some later, would you mind giving us some privacy for a moment?""



Sure have a slice.




""Would you like the entirety of this pie""



Prety much the only time you should eat more than a slice",Human
4aiufj,"Personally, I think it's common courtesy not to finish someone else's food. I'm not going to have the last slice of your pie, last beer in the fridge, etc. if it isn't mine. Never eat the first or last of someone else's stuff, especially if you don't replace it.

I don't think you're the asshole. While I would be pissed at the others, it's less ""asshole"" behavior and more ""self-absorbed"" behavior. I lived with a lot of roommates who weren't bad people but just could never think about how their actions effected other people.",Human
4aiufj,"I absolutely think they are the assholes in this situation. Also, if they're constantly kicking you out of the living room then they are just assholes in general.",Human
4aiufj,you clearly didn't offer them ALL your pie and it was a dick move of them to finish it off.,Human

4ajzlv,"I would say there's no assholes here. Everyone gets frustrated - it's whether you act on it or not that separates the assholes from the rest.

So, if you lashed out at your mom after seeing her reaction, you could become the asshole depending on what you did. But it sounds like you still tried to comfort her and internalized your anger.

Her behaviour seems a bit assholeish on the surface, but it also sounds like she and your dad have a lot they're going through, so I wouldn't label her the asshole either.

I hope your parents get any help they need.",Human
4ajzlv,Me too. thanks for the input.,Human
4alun9,"How old are you? Both you and the girl seem to not have more mature forms of dating/relating to the opposite sex. Which is fine, there is always time to learn.

It is very usual for girls/women, especially those who are in a situation in which they feel awkward and/or without power, to say yes to something like a date when they don't mean yes. It's much easier to say no behind a screen when you don't have to worry about the other person's reaction. If you're young, she may also be nervous about going on a date and therefore be rethinking her answer to you. Her parents may have told her she can't go and she's trying to buy time to convince them. She may even be someone who doesn't make plans very far in advance and would text you a day before she was available. 

Since she was openly friendly and waved at you, it seems like there is some misunderstanding/miscommunication. You ignoring her, however, whatever the situation puts you in a very immature role in this interaction. It is always better to give someone the benefit of the doubt and try to communicate for more clarity in the situation than to ignore them. You ignoring her broke off the communication that could potentially explained her behavior. 

You should not have assumed that her lack of answer meant ""no"" when there are a variety of things it could have meant. Overall, an asshole for ignoring her. But mostly, just immature. ",Human
4alun9,"I'm 20,she is 18. You're right about me being inexperienced with dating. I was an athlete since i was 14 and was never allowed to date much due to training,i should have explained tho,that we are in Brazil,so the culture around dating is different from how Americans do it,at least i think so,from watching your tv shows and stuff. What i mean is that,dating here is very very casual,for example,when i asked her out i said i was gonna walk my dog at the park and she should come with us,that's our type of date. That's why i don't think she was nervous about going out as you mentioned.

  You're so right about me ignoring her tho.. shit,i fucked up so bad,that must have looked childish,but it was my first reflex. 

  I think you're right about the first thing you said too,about her not wanting the pressure of turning me down on person,but i will be honest,i still think it was rude of her,because i'm not a very threatening person.. shit i was walking around in my boxers when we met haha. Anyway what confuses me most is that she is the one who approached me in the first place and she was giving me ""puppy eyes"" all the time we were talking,that's why i asked her out in the first place,cuz it looked like she was into me. Anyway thanks for your reply",Human
4alun9,"Cultural differences makes sense. Why don't you go talk to her, explain why you ignored her, say sorry for jumping to conclusions, and ask her why she didn't respond back? You could clear up a lot of misunderstandings with just a little bit of communication.",Human
4alun9,"Oh i would be so nervous about talking to her now.. i mean she is obviously pissed off.. what if i go talk to her and she really just meant to say ""no"" ? That would be so awkward and in my mind it's the most likely scenario.",Human
4alun9,"Then just let it be. It's up to you to make the next move. 

1. Continue to ignore her, she and her friend likely think you're an asshole and you move on. 

2. Ask what was up she says no and you get embarrassed slightly and move on. At least in this case, while embarrassed, you can remain friendly with her.

3. Ask what was up, it was a misunderstanding, and y'all go on a date.",Human
4alun9,Hm... yeah i guess no harm can come from talking.,Human
4alun9,"Another thing to consider is that it is ok for her not to want to go out with you, but to still want to talk to you, or be friendly with you in class.",Human
4alun9,"Yes, you acted negatively because you're thinking negative thoughts trying to understand an unfamiliar situation. You took your frustration out on her while she was being friendly and probably hurt her feelings. Don't let things get to you this much and always be kind.",Human
4alun9,Yes. What the hell is wrong with you? Who taught you how to act like this? It doesn't make sense.,Human

4anwyp,"For me, a funeral is not about going for the person who died.  The dead person can't care whether you're there or not.

Funerals (for me at least) are about supporting the ones left behind.  So if you ask me, what really makes the difference as to whether you're an asshole or not is whether or not you are close to any of your cousin's immediate family.

There are many people who just can't handle funerals as well and don't go because of that, but it sounds like that isn't the case for you.

I can't say asshole or not because funerals are weird and everyone reacts differently to death.",Human

Also while taunting, you cannot move or do anything for a certain amount of time. He expected me to approach him because that's what most people do when their opponent is charging the limit breaker.

It is the prerogative of the losing player to attempt to make up a deficit. It is not the winning players's duty to offer them the easy chance to.

In my (noncompetetive) experience, Smash is as about advantageous and disadvantageous position as it is about anything else. He can't expect you to willingly come at him from a disadvantageous position - it is his job to force you into one. The fact that he got so upset doesnt have anything to do with the morality of your conduct, it only has to do with his inability to play dispassionately.

It sounds like OP's girlfriend was fine with the idea of an open relationship, up until the point OP actually went out with someone, and then it wasn't ok anymore. Remember that this was 2 months after the start of 'going open'. There's even potential here that OP's girlfriend had already gone out with someone else, but didn't want OP to do the same. We don't know the full story on girlfriend's side, but this sounds majorly scumbaggy.

Not being okay with an open relationship is perfectly fine, but then you should say so. Changing your mind at any time is ok, but doing so just when they tell you they're hooking up with someone is... suspect.

I've been in an open relationship before (although it was under coercive circumstances, so I'm definitely not saying that this is how all open relationships are or should be) and I wasn't really comfortable with it even just in theory but I could deal with it because I had to deal with it. When he actually told me for the first time about him hooking up with someone else as part of the open relationship though, I realized that I was deeply not okay with the open relationship and if I had been aware of it while it was happening, I would have called him to try to prevent it from going any further, which it sounds like is what the girlfriend did.

Somewhat holding you by the balls (im not saying that it is her fault or that she intentionally did it) but I don't think you are the asshole as you did not manipulate any of the rules.

It is practical, but I still do not condem it. (crap example :/) I understand that she cannot necessarily control how she will feel when it comes down to it and it can be somewhat impulsive. I guess i just see that as a human flaw that she has not overcome. It seems to me like she is the asshole for expecting him to confine to her desires upon a moments notice (even though im not surprised, It is more so a literal dick move without getting into the fluffy emotional side of things). But i think the problem here is our seperate definition of what makes someone an asshole. I'd say both have a personal empathetic bias towards either the girl or the guy.

You've been together for nine months. It might not feel like it, but that's an eye blink. Five years is not. I don't think it matters whether you are being an asshole or not - committing yourself for that long is just a bad idea. Especially since, to be honest, you probably won't be together for that long. 

I only know one couple that survived different universities, versus probably a hundred that split, and they started dating *after* they'd been apart for a year. They liked each other that much. Both are extremely driven and both have a *lot* of experience with other people - and they started when they were 21, not 18.

Going just by what OP has said, there seems to be a fundamental difference between how they and their parents view the world. It appears there's a little bit of wrong on both ends. 

Where op is wrong:  they say that they are being judged by the standard of someone with a healthy mind. I hate to break it to you, but that's all life, forever. You can have these problems, (I have also struggled in this way, so I'm not unsympathetic) but as an adult is up to you to manage them. If you are incapable of managing them, then you need to go into assisted living, because this is basic self preservation.  Let me phrase another way OPs story could be told:  my child lives on my property, will not maintain basic sanitation of my property, drinks heavily, acts erratically, hasn't worked a job that we didn't give them, and depends on us financially, causing strain and stress in our marriage.  That's totally dick, right there. 

Where OPs parents are wrong: being pragmatic makes the wheels of life turn smoothly. Things are rational. Eat less, work out more, be less fat. Easy, right? Until you use this logic to shame your own child in front of their friends. Who does that? You're breaking down someone who depends on you for everything, love, guidance, food, shelter, in a way that fucks with their head. Of course your child is depressed. Look at the way they're being spoken to. When expo",Human
4b9a78,"No, you're not an asshole. Usually when someone fails to separate themselves from their parents in adulthood (emotionally or physically) they have what's known as ""attachment"" issues. Somehow the person through no fault of his or her own had needs that were not adequately met in infancy/childhood, leading the child to feel insecure. Also common is the inclination to stay and ""save"" one's own parents, who were unable to provide an adequate level of healthy love and support (sometimes by no fault of their own, rather they hadn't received it themselves and didn't know how to be better parents). Sound familiar with the family business?

",Human
4bdesp,Care to elaborate?,Human
4bdesp,"Probably not. I assume since your girlfriend is sick she's not being super loud, and is mostly hanging out in your room (as opposed to the common areas). If that's the case your roommate is being pretty ornery and unreasonable (assuming you don't have an explicit agreement that guests will not stay over for more than an hour or two).

Look up the tenant's rights for your area. I believe that in most places your landlord (and by extension your roommate) cannot bar you from having guests over for short periods.

Before talking to your roommate I would first talk to your girlfriend and see what exactly she's been up to and whether she's being unreasonably loud or hanging out in the common areas for extended periods of time. I'd then have a civil discussion with your roommate. Ask what specific behaviour of your girlfriend's he takes issue with, and if it's reasonable (she leaves a mess in the kitchen or hogs the TV, etc) then fix it. If she's not doing anything unreasonable and it's simply that she's *there* that he takes issue with, tell him that you will try to accommodate him by not spending long periods of time in the common areas with her (say this even if you're already doing that) but that if he has such a strong aversion to house guests that he can't even stand them when they stay in your room then that's something he should have raised when you all moved in together as it's above and beyond what is usually expected.

Things are probably going to be tense no matter what ",Human
4bdesp,"You're not an asshole. But you're certainly getting on the nerves of your roommates whether or not you think it's warranted. Your roommate summed it up as ""this situation is fine, but you need to respect the house more."" It's reasonable to be comfortable within your home. It's reasonable that roommates don't want your girlfriend just hanging out without you there. There will always be conflict when that many people live together but if everyone feels surrounded by assholes you ought to find a different living arrangement.",Human
4bdesp,"Honestly, you're all assholes here. If it was quiet enough before, but now they're complaining about it, that makes them assholes, but you're an asshole as well because you can easily wear headphones and end that discussion completely.

With your girlfriend coming over, is she living there? how long is a normal stay? Does she contribute to rent, utilities, chores, or anything at all? A weekend every month or so isn't a problem I would assume, but if she's basically living there, which by the sounds of it, is what's going on, it would make your roommates feel better if she would contribute. ",Human
4bdesp,"Fine. It's not your roommates responsibility to entertain, look after or tolerate your girlfriend when you are not there. I'd be annoyed if i was them too. I don't want to put up with someone else's girlfriend getting comfortable in my house.",Human
4bdesp,"I don't think you're the asshole. My boyfriend lived in a big house with 5 people and I hung out there plenty when my boyfriend was not around. It helped that I became good friends with all his roommates, it's too bad they all can't be friendlier with each other because it really is quite awesome when you can all play boardgames and hang out with or without your significant other.",Human
4bdesp,"As you're presenting it here, no. You sound pretty reasonable and you've made efforts to adjust your habits when they've brought up issues in the past. 

I'd try to sit down with your roommates when your girlfriend isn't around and try to nail down exactly their issue. Try to lay down some firm boundaries around house rules overall, e.g. quiet hours and what quiet really means, policies around guests, and other stuff house stuff. That'll let you frame it as being proactive so no other issues arise and just making sure you're all on the same page.

My guess they need to lighten up a little, and you need to be a little better about communicating. One common thing you'll see in student housing is kids who haven't been on their own very long and haven't really adjusted to living in apartments/close quarters and with people who aren't family. For example, your gf being at home without you isn't something they should discover. You should have told them.",Human
4bdesp,"Your second paragraph nailed it. Sounds like the roomates are just tired of a fourth roomate living rent/responsibility free.

4bdesp,"I'd certainly say you're not being an asshole here, although it seems like no one really gets along with each other. It sounds to me like there's some tension between you and your roommates, at least enough so for things like this to set them off and I've got to question if there were past instances of problems relating to your girlfriend in the house since your roommate said ""you need to respect the house more"". That doesn't sound like a one time offense and I'd hardly consider your computer being noisy one night being the alluded to complaint. Are you good friends with your roommates? Along with this, is your girlfriend friendly with them or do they not get along? 

Honestly, I'm disappointed in some of the comments here. A weekend every month or so is the only reasonable timeframe? Like what the fuck. I live with two other guys, both of which have girlfriends. They're over every weekend or every other weekend, but someone's girlfriends usually around each weekend and it's fine. They'll also come by somedays during the week and hangout. I don't expect them to pay extra for utilities since they have to use the bathroom. That seems just so ridiculously uptight I don't know how I'd live with myself expecting everything to be perfectly fair and evenly split. If you get along with people it becomes shockingly easy to not be spiteful when another person enters your house. Obviously there is a limit to everything. If someone's girlfriend was regularly *living* in the house, like d",Human
4bdesp,"I'm going with ""need more information,"" and would want to know just much ""welcome"" your GF has in the house. Is she there every night? If she really is overstaying, it's a conversation you need to have with your roommates.

Based on what you've presented here, though, I'll go with ""Everyone sucks"" because it's a shit move to expect a truly sick person to have to do just about anything.",Human
4bdesp,"If your girlfriend was sick, why was she at your place, rather than resting at her own house/apartment/dorm?

He shouldn't have parked in your spot that you're paying for and so you have every right to get his car removed, however it seems like you didn't attempt to find out who's car it was, simply nocking on a few doors could have got you the answers you needed and the owner could have been sincere and moved his car.",Human
4bhrss,"&gt; I came home yesterday and the car that normally parks directly next to me was parked in my space. His own parking spot had another car in it. Since he didn’t have that person towed I’m assuming it was a guest of his.

I don't think that's necessarily a good assumption.  I think it's likely your neighbor came home to find someone else in his spot, and just decided to take another spot instead.

But that still wasn't the right move on his part. By parking in your spot and not leaving you any contact info he put you in a position where really you had to do what you did.

Unless...you say this is a large building.  Does it have some type of on-site staff you could have contacted to figure things out?  Like a super, security, doorman, that sort of thing.

If I were in your situation I'd be pissed off at the person who told me to buy the game, but if you knew you had bad internet then surely buying a game that relies heavily on having a good connection to servers was a slightly dumb move anyway? 

What is the game in question? Can you get a good experience from it without a strong broadband setup? Games like The Division and WoW explicitly market their dependence on internet connections, so overlooking that may have been foolish. 

At a guess I'd say you're probably not being an asshole, but the key to remaining in the clear is not holding a grudge. After all, they just wanted you to be able to play the game with them which is kinda nice. ",Human

But even if it has minor lag I can play to a competitive degree. I just can't play with gamebreaking lag. The game is an MMO. 

I was probably not as calm as I could of been. I was talking faster than normal and I probably should of made my voice go monotone and put less emotion in it. I'm not that great with confronting people.

If I were in your position, I would apologize to them, and come to them with a very clear outline of how they could switch servers, if only on a trial basis, and remind them that you got the game specifically to play with them. But work very, very hard not to sound like a whiner about it.

I've met a number of people who lacked awareness of the tone that they're using at times (or all the time...), and I legitimately feel very sorry for them, because it gets in the way of having solid friendships and getting along with others in general, and they are usually clueless about why people seem to dislike them so much, or ""start"" conflicts with them all the time. I wish I knew some good tips to help those folks (who I suspect you are one of)... perhaps recording your own voice and playing it back for yourself would help? And more subtly, I suspect that some time spent exploring and truly empathizing with others and imagining things from their perspective **honestly** may also help.

People often think that because it's a game your ""real life"" feeling as inconsequential and it annoys me to no end.

Enough of my rant. NO you're not an asshole, you're just not great at explaining you're feelings to them.

Something like this would work:

""I get that it's just a game, but I really didn't have any interest in getting this...the only reason I got it was so that I could play with you guys. But it seems like everyone is never on and the one time everyone DOES get on I feel like the fact that I couldn't play was inconsequential. I understand that it's easily explained away as me getting upset at nothing but I'm not sure how to communicate that I feel let down by this whole thing.

I want to play and I want to have fun, but can I pick the server next time? Or at the very least if I can't join a game can we find one that works for everyone? Otherwise it feels like the bar is full and I'm left of the street.""

A wedding, for me, is about experiencing a great day and celebrating the union between my wife and I.  If someone chooses not to attend because they think I should have invited someone else, they can do that, it's completely their right.

* Your friend got wasted last time he hung out with the couple.  Can you give us a little more information about what happened that night?  You say it wasn't a big deal, but obviously the bride and/or groom don't think so.  Did your friend say something offensive to the couple?  Did he hit on the bride?  Hit on the groom?  Make a bridesmaid uncomfortable?  Has he done this before?  Does he get wasted often?

* You say the bride/groom gave a ""very flimsy and honestly judgmental excuse"" about why they weren't invited.  But you conveniently don't tell us what that excuse was, and just want to us accept your evaluation.  Was the reason she gave related to the drinking event above?  Was it something else?  A combination of things?",Human
4bn71r,"&gt; You say the bride/groom gave a ""very flimsy and honestly judgmental excuse"" about why they weren't invited. But you conveniently don't tell us what that excuse was

Dude, the excuse was that he got drunk and puked in their toilet. That's it. Hence me saying it's flimsy.

He didn't say anything rude to either person, nor hit on either of them. The soon to be bride explicitly said he was a drunk mess puking all night. Like I said I was there, he wasn't puking all over their floor, he felt sick so he went to the bathroom, standard operating procedure. I don't know what more he could have done. They invited us to go out to a bar, it's not like he showed up to a nature hike plastered. ",Human
4bn71r,"I don't hate them or anything. I just can't associate with them any longer if this is how they think now.  I'm not planning on making it a big issue although I'm sure they'll be curious as to why I'm not attending.  The worst part of this to me is it's not like I haven't seen both of these people wasted before either. They've had their moments too, I think they have an underlying dislike of the guy and pounced on the first semi reasonable excuse to uninvite him. Shitty move that I won't support. I don't want it to create any extra stress for their event but at the same time I feel they've brought a reaction upon themselves, I've spoken to a few others who are bailing or considering bailing now as well.",Human

4bn71r,"OK, we are slowly making progress here, and getting relevant facts out little by little.  In a situation like this, the details matter.

For example, it's not just that he got sick during a night of drinking at some random bar.  He got sick at ***the couple's house, in their bathroom.***

Did he apologize?  Did he clean their bathroom when he sobered up?  Did the bride have to scrub his puke off the seat in the morning?  What were the details of that evening?

If I had to guess, I'd say the bride feels like your drunk friend was an impolite/rude guest in her home, and that's certainly a reason not to invite someone to your wedding.

",Human
4bn71r,"Not to mention that weddings often contain things like open bars and straitlaced relatives.

Adding a guest who you know can't moderate his alcohol intake is not a good fit for that environment. Why put somebody who gets pass-out-and-puke drunk in the same room as judgey Aunt Irma and a limitless supply of booze for which you are paying?",Human

&gt; Did he apologize? Did he clean their bathroom when he sobered up? Did the bride have to scrub his puke off the seat in the morning? What were the details of that evening?

He apologized the next day yes. He cleaned up the bathroom, I went in the next morning to use it, he wiped the seat down, it could have used a full brushing I suppose but it wasn't offensively caked in vomit or anything of that nature.  

And again, he's known them for ten years, even if all of these things were cause to uninvite him I feel that the year of time that has past between now and then would have been long enough for either of them to tell him they were upset with that night. They have seen him since then and been nice to his face only for the bride to call someone else and by proxy say some mean shit about him. I don't think I've missed any details, other responses have been fine too. If you think me siding with someone for having one mild fuck up in a ten year friendship is cause to be treated like that makes me an asshole so be it but I think I've already gotten my answer. I felt awkward at first, not anymore tho.",Human

You don't really get to decide if it's flimsy or how important it is to them, though. This is their day. Their *only* wedding day. If it's a big enough deal that they don't want to take the risk, that is entirely up to them to decide, not you.",Human
4bn71r,"I don't decide how flimsy it is to them, however I was there and I know how flimsy it is. Calling it a ""risk"" is overstating imo. We've had a ton of other weddings in our friend group, a couple of which he's been a groomsmen for and never was out of line on the big day. Also, by banning him I don't think they've eliminated the prospect of someone getting wasted at a wedding. 

They can do whatever they like but if they're at a point in their lives where ten years of friendship can be shot down with this guy over one bad night then I don't need to stick around and find out what it would take to have them do the same to me is what I'm getting at I guess.

Read the lease carefully, but if they can't fulfill their end of the deal, then they at least owe you accommodations for the night.  The hotel room should be on them, as well as any additional moving costs you might incur due to the delay (i.e. extra day of truck rental, etc)

4c17ki,"You are not ""bound"" to do anything but pay taxes and die. There is no rule against posting your Reddit conversations here but it is frowned upon, especially when you're so obviously the asshole and don't want to admit it.",Human
4c17ki,"I'm not denying anything. I've gotten good feedback here (regardless of the verdict), part of which yours is obviously not. What you do is make assumptions and draw conclusions on your own, which you could say is frowned upon as well. And when I try to give you my part of the story (which I see fit when someone judges me based on presumptions) you are anything but perceptive of it. I don't think this sub is the right one for you to comment on (as it may be for me to post on in a world where thinking you're not an asshole is a crime like you make it out to be).",Human

4c17ki,"Not really. Alot of PCmasterrace also use consoles, they just believe PCs are better. It's just like if you went on /r/Androidcirclejerk. They don't actually believe all the things they are saying. It's just a joke.",Human
4c17ki,Yes. But you two weirdos seem made for each other. Fucken stalker.,Human
4c17ki,"Sometimes others see it as a clear verdict who's the asshole and forget that it might not be so black and white. This person obviously see it as a clear cut case and can't imagine you being in doubt.

Don't get too hung up on that. If you're really in doubt, I salute you for trying to figure out what is the right way to tackle a situation like that.

It seems that the right way to tackle it is to let go. Sometimes I write a long reply to someone I disagree with and end it all by ctrl+a, deleting everything. It's not always worth it. Choose your battles. What are you really gaining? In real life, if people judge you unfairly, you might save face by explaining yourself, but on the internet, on an anonymous forum? There's no need. You'll never talk again, it doesn't matter that one person, out there, somewhere, misunderstood you once. Let it go.

I think this stems from taking human interaction on the internet seriously, and I, again, completely salute that! I felt that way once as well. But you can't honor every conversation, there are so many and most of them are low effort. It's not worth it.",Human

4c8g89,"Yes. Especially given your second comment where you mentioned she's not actually Mexican, and you confused her ethnicity.

Mexican even though she's from another continent entirely",Human

4c8g89,Absolutely 100% yes you're the asshole...,Human
4c8g89,"On it's own, I wouldn't think it a terribly asshole move, just a lighthearted joke, but as UberDave said, you didn't know your audience well enough, especially since you didn't even know her ethnicity. Are you sure she's also a girl and not just a boy with long hair? :-P ",Human
4c8g89,With an entirely different native language that isn't even from the same primary language family as English and Spanish haha. No wonder she was a bit miffed at him.,Human

If you two were merely acquaintances, then yeah, I could see how she would get offended. If she was a close friend though, it's her fault for getting bent out of shape over a simple joke.

4c8g89,"I think it would have been pretty funny. But, as I saw in other comments, she's Estonian, not Mexican, which are nowhere near each other, so your joke kind of falls flat. You're the asshole.",Human

4cdrha,"I didn't plan on intentionally saying it in a way that is malicious, which is precisely why I asked. I planned on creating a a Reddit post on certain subreddits with some bullet  points, one being ""Ad free"" but ""Optional ads"" gets the point across without being an ass.

Just didn't want you to think I was intentionally false advertising.",Human
4cdrha,"I don't think you're an asshole.
I think you're like most other game/app devs who want the best possible outcome for their beloved game/app. Sure, it's *kinda* misleading but I think if you had maybe a pop- up or something of the like INDICATING that say, if the user went to settings they could disable the ads. 


There's a website out there (can't remember name of) that has an un-closable pop-up with an obviously monetized video ad. The caption or preface or whatever is something along the lines of ""Be annoyed. Watch the ad. Our game devs worked very hard for this""

Perhaps this could be a better a resolution. But anyway, more to the point, everyone needs money to live. Even you, believe it or not. 
Just try not to advertise your app as something it's not.

4ce6om,"So take what he's said and run with it.

If it costs a dollar to replace, buy your own. Don't let him use your lead, he can buy his own, after all, they only cost a dollar. Esp as it's your problem. Now his problem is not having a lead. 

You shouldn't have let him sit on your amp? He can't sit on it and can only go near it to plug in.",Human

4cg2ly,"Your brother sounds like someone that has learned through his ~20 years of life that he can manipulate you into doing more than what you agreed to do.  If that is true, than only doing what you agreed to do is going to feel to him like you are an asshole, because he is used to getting you to agree to X, then tacking on Y, and Z as well.  

He can play shocked that you won't do this ""little"" thing for him, because you probably have taken the bait in the past, and some unconsious subroutine in your brain says you are bad if you upset him, so you do what he wants.  Straight. Manipulation.

So to him, yes you are an asshole.  But here is the kicker:  **You will never change his view.**  No matter how many reasons you give him explaining your point, he won't suddenly say "" Gee bro, you know, I thought I had good reasons for thinking what I did, but now it is crystal clear that I infact was wrong.""  That will never happen.

All you can do is what you want to do, and let his butthurtness be his problem.

And the only reason he came back at you about talking to your dad, is because it worked, and dad sided with you.  You threatened how dad sees him, and threatened his 1300 a month meal ticket.  

BTW, why cant brother drive?  Let me guess:  DUI.  


TL;DR Sticking up for fair treatment seems unfair to those who are used to walking all over you.

4cg2ly,"Just a tiny teeny weeny bit in the whole scheme of things here. People who drop people off at red lights and hold traffic up as it turns green are assholes. Be prepared to jump out right away folks!

If you don't want to do something for him, don't do it. If you do, do it and be glad you were able to help your brother. Don't do the favor and then resent it.

It's also hard to know from your telling whether we're talking about a broheim ""asshole""-and-love-tap or him punching you with malice. I suspect maybe you're misinterpreting the moment. He may have just been saving a little face and not meant much by it. Maybe I'm just reading that in though.",Human

But, I do not side with you *completely* either.
The way you handled the car situation kind of makes you out to be the douche. Even though yes, you were doing him a huge favor by doing it etc.. 
Your attitude  in that situation, and the way you portrayed your pettiness afterward kind of lets you down on this one.
The Facebook thing kind of makes the decision for me though. The last time he tried contacting you was purely for money. Not a good sign. If it is your *only* means of communication between physical visits that's not right at all. A simple hi, how are you doing  every once in a while wouldn't go astray. 

Simply put,
you're not the asshole... as far as I can tell.

However, I think you weighed the situation properly. If it were me, I'd rather be a bit of an asshole than miss out on something I've been waiting on for years. 

In regards to her forgiveness, it sounds like you handled the situation with grace, and if she knew you well, she would know how much the trip meant to you. So you're definitely not the asshole enough to warrant her never forgiving you. ",Human
4cl9sk,"No, you had been waiting for years! Not the asshole.",Human

Sucks for you, but the chance that another spot might open up (albeit year(s) later) is there. She's not going to have a banquet where she's named President again. 

That being said, on the asshole scale, I'd say you were a 4/10. Not the worst thing you could have done, but still kinda shitty. ",Human

You said she she forgave you, so she probably understands that, and just wishes the timing worked out better.  That's a good sign of a keeper.  Self-centered grudge-holders make bad partners.  I advise you to find a way to make it up to her, just for good measure.  Bitches love romantic apologies.",Human
4cl9sk,Found the asshole.,Human
4cl9sk,Not the asshole. A week plenty of notice for her to find a replacement for you. If she's that upset about the whole thing she can take him home for a nice foot massage afterwords,Human
4cl9sk,This happened a couple years ago. We broke up pretty soon after but this wasn't the only reason. I think she might have understood but she for gave me nonetheless. Like an earlier comment said I was almost already checking out of the relationship which I think made it seem worse to the people around me.,Human
4cl9sk,"Not the asshole, everyone will get over it, and she will too. ",Human
4cl9sk,"Of course you are the asshole.  You gave your word to your girlfriend that you would be at an important event for her, and then you better-dealed her.  That is bad enough, but in the two weeks between when you said yes, and when you said no, she probably told other people important to her you were coming too, and then she had walk that back because you are unreliable.  Not good.

For you to not be the asshole, you would have had to say you would do it unless your dad scored you a spot on his team.  She might not like that response, but it is honest.  

Your statement:  "" I don't think I did anything that bad because it was something I really really cared about.""  is very selfish.  You can back out of anything with that reasoning.  Sorry guys, I was going to come to your wedding, but I really really wanted a burrito instead, so its all good, right?

Once you make that commitment, you stick to it, because *you are only as good as your word*.  If your word is no good, you are an asshole.

Finally, you ""broke the news"".  You didn't ask her if she would be okay with a change, you told her how it was going to be.  That screams asshole to a lot of people.

The good news is you can communicate better next time.

4cn67f,"&gt;i've told everyone that i don't plan on selling anything, 

Not the ass hole in anyway shape or form. The furniture was there when they moved in, frankly I'd be thankful I didn't have to buy any because you already had some for the common areas.  Thanks for letting me use your furniture, don't give a shit what it looks like.  


&gt;if they had any ideas on how to [...] decorate the existing free spaces (which is maybe a quarter of all the common space) as they can run it past me and we'll try to work something out. 

Kind of an ass hole.   Its existing free space, anyone should be able to say ""hey guys I want to hand this poster, cool?"" Yes, your the master tenant but it's still their home.  I don't think you get the final say on all remaining free space, everyone gets a vote. 
",Human
4cn67f,"posters and art aren't a problem. a couple of the roommates put some art up near their rooms, and the roommate in question actually has more wall space in use than i do. 

her main gripe is my furniture. a couple of the bigger pieces she has problems with are either older (like my couch) or custom (the dining booth). either way, if i get rid of those items, it'll be almost impossible to replace them in the future. 

my stuff isn't fancy or anything, but it's cool-looking, functional,  sturdy, and it matches. there's no holes in anything, and nothing is stained or gross. also, my house has a lot of weirdly shaped rooms, and i spent a lot of time finding pieces that suited the space. the couch fits perfectly along the curved wall in the livingroom. the booth looks like it was made for the corner it occupies. i mean, i bought it off craigslist, but still. the bookcases fit the exact length of the wall they're on. 

i wouldn't give a shit if i could just walk into ikea and buy another couch to match the one i have now.  

i've never had a roommate make this request before. and i've never made this kind of request when i was the roommate in someone else's home. i've bought furniture for previous homes, to be sure, but they already had space and it was discussed before i moved in.   

[edit] the ""we'll work something out"" statement wasn't me trying to have the final say on their decor. it was meant more if they wanted to do something that would require some rearranging of existing ",Human
4cn67f,Gotcha. You're not the ass hole.   She sounds crazy.  ,Human
4cn67f,"I had a roommate do that. He is subletting for less than a year and demanded I get rid of furniture, large fish tanks, etc that have been here before him and will be here after him. 

Let her know that you're sorry she is unhappy, and that she can move out after the lease. If you're extra awesome you could offer her the out of moving early if she finds a subletter or something. She moved in with the house as it was, and now is unhappy. But that's what she signed up for. 

Good luck. She sounds awful. If it's anything like what I had happen, it will continue being painfully awful and awkward until her moves out in a month and omg I cannot wait. ",Human
4cn67f,"Nope, she has no right to this, it's just an idea, one that you have rejected and requires no further discussion.",Human

All was going well until we got to the lounge and he straight up told me I would need to get all new furniture and rearrange EVERYTHING. I was like, nope k thx for coming bye and he started throwing a fucking tantrum. It was surreal.

4cn67f,"You definitely don't have to, but if you did want to try to find some middle ground, you could just put the stuff in storage. I think storage lockers are pretty cheap and then for instance you could put either the couch or the booth in storage with the condition that she buy (and pay for herself or with the help of the other roommates if they want a say in what the couch looks like)something to replace it so you still have the same amount of seating. 

I think it's reasonable to want to decorate your living space, even if it's shared space, and it's reasonable to expect to be able to do that especially after living somewhere for a few years. You're the one whose name is on the lease though, so you're the one with the power to say yes or no to that, and it's not reasonable to expect someone to get rid of their own furniture that was there beforehand and that isn't horrendous just because you want to redecorate. 
However, do make sure in the future to tell potential roommates that you are not willing to make changes to the existing furniture and that if they want to decorate something, the spaces they are allowed to truly redecorate (as opposed to rearrange) only make up about a quarter of the living space and they'll have to share the right to decorate that space with all of the other existing roommates.

she doesn't value my stuff. it's all old chairs and science fiction novels; obviously not worth the cost of storing to her. 

[to be fair, the furniture didn't cost much. but the time it took me to track certain pieces down is worth something to me. it took a few months of regular craigslisting to track down the couch -and- the booth.] 

we'll see what happens. part of the reason i posted here is because i don't bitch to my friends too much about drama in my life. i'd rather keep my hang out time positive. the negative side of that is sometimes i can't *quite* tell if i'm being unreasonable or not. even if i did whine a lot about it, who's to say if my friends won't have a biased opinion in my favor? 

sometimes it can be much better to poll a few strangers, and the answers here make me feel better about my decision to not toss a bunch of stuff. 

",Human
4cn67f,"we live in the bay area. like, i can see san francisco from my roof. our house isn't rent controlled but is still well under market value. there's a lot of master tenants with cheap units benefiting by renting rooms at/near market rate. 

i'd feel bad doing that. i may not be the sweetest person in my neighborhood, but i'm not trying to fuck people over. 

[the last time i had a room available, i had two programmers offer me more than i was asking, and one girl offered to sleep with me for it. she was cute and i was available-ish, but that dynamic under my roof is a bad idea so i declined.]

but yeah. 600 bucks for a 300sqft 2nd storey bedroom with lots of parking in a quiet (albeit industrial) neighborhood a mile from downtown oakland? some fool was just in the news for paying 400 bucks a month to sleep in a literal wooden box in san francisco. 

i think the main issue is she always considered her time here transitional. she was in a bad place and my house was just a placeholder until she could find her own unit down nearby. but rent everywhere else got too damn high, so she's trying to justify carving out a big chunk of downstairs for herself.

4cn67f,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and suggest the storing of the sci-fi novels was apparent when said roommate moved in. If she were to have an issue with it, she had ample opportunity to either say so or back out. Moving in and then trying to change the arrangement is a dick move imo. Furthermore: okay, granted, keeping personal stuff in a communal space could be less than ideal - but having to look at ugly decoration ""because it's my communal space too"" is at the very least just as bad.",Human
4cn67f,"it's not even ""storing"", per se. most all my books are up in bookshelves. there's a few unread novels stacked on a small table in the corner, but everything else is arranged by author and genre up on the wall. 

 
if i had a bunch of boxes piled up in the corner, i'd understand, but the bookshelves aren't in the way of anything. and my books aren't off limits to anyone. i've had a few roommates treat my collection like a little library. 

i've even loaned books to roommate's friends. sometimes i don't get them back, but whatever. i'm easy-going about my stuff and can sacrifice a book every now and then if it gets someone back into reading.  

none of my stuff in the common spaces is off limits to the house. my books are fair game, my furniture is there to be sat on, all of my kitchen utensils and doodads are shared, i let them use my stereo and record player, and when i upgrade the movie projector i have in my room, i'll put my current one downstairs so they can have movie nights. 

if i don't want someone using something of mine, i'll hide it in my room or in my section of the pantry, not set it in the middle of the livingroom with a keep out note. ",Human

Question is: how are you going to deal with the situation? You know if you don't address it properly it can become really messy really fast...",Human
4cn67f,"well, nothing for the next month or so. the roommate in question left to backpack through europe or someshit until mid-may.  hopefully when she gets back her jimmies won't be rustled and she'll just hide in her room and look for a new spot. 

i'm hesistant to do a proper eviction because it'll be a complete upheaval on her life. rent is so high everywhere around us that she'd probably have to leave the city and get a new job and everything. she's a completely nice person to everyone who isn't standing between her and her dream-house (or in positions of authority in general, i suppose), and really, we don't have to be friends to live together. 

[sure i have friends getting priced out of our city who already love what i've done with the place. i'd love to be able to offer one of them an affordable place to live, but that's no reason to screw up someone else's 2016.]  

so yeah; hopefully she'll calm down when she gets back and either find another place (ideal) or just hide in her room like normal (less than ideal, but acceptable). she might decide to keep up the new attitude and cause more problems. i don't see her just hanging out downstairs like a regular roommate though. i think our relationship is too strained for that. 

another reason to not serve a proper eviction is because we live in a weird kinda janky industrial neighborhood. our landlords know we're living in the house, and the city knows we all live down here. the landlords are quasi-slummy, but they leave us alon",Human

I would agree with that to an extent for parents regarding their children, but not the other way around as in this case.

Plus, the things your dad's side of the family said are awful. That anyone could excuse alcoholism and child abuse in such a flippant way is horrifying.

I have asked those on his side who reasonably could (No young kids to take care, capable of taking care of themselves, living alone or with a significant other who is equally healthy, etc) to take him if they feel that way but they typically say ""He's YOURS, not ours.""

Seems fitting with the type of mentality that would excuse him being an abusive alcoholic because it's his ""genes"", as long as it doesn't effect them directly.  You're in a really shitty spot, but you're not the asshole.  I agree with the other responses that say if they feel so strongly that family should take care of him, they should do it.

You need to understand that you have your own life to live, you don't own him anything, because otherwise, you would spend your life taking care of a guy who made you miserable and 20-30 years from now, he dies, and now what you got, nothing, not even happy memories.

A while back when Regina and another server both worked mornings, the other server told her (more or less), ""You need to quit pushing your work off on others and you need to tip more. I like having a busboy and none of them want to work with us because of you."" Regina proceeded to call the owners saying that she felt threatened by said server and the server got removed from working mornings with her (she almost got fired, too).

Also, funny thing is a coworker texted saying that three other busboys told Deb they'd all quit if they get put on morning shifts again. I don't know if they have the balls to go through with it, but it makes me happy knowing some of my busbros have my back.

As an aside, my sort of commentary on your situation is, if Regina sucks that much, and they can't find/keep bussers to work with her, then, taken to conclusion, eventually they will either have to fire her, or continuously replace busboys. Since that takes a non-zero amount of administrative work, sooner or later it will come to a head. That's just capitalism. 

If you aren't getting what your time is worth, then it's in your best interest to just find another job.

If OP refuses to work other people will, even if they dislike her. Other people being terrible isn't an excuse to do a bad job. I would suggest that the manager is responsible for collecting the tips from each table and tipping you out at the end of shift. If she is unwilling the walk away.",Human
4vp91a,"Yes, you are being an asshole. This is the real world. Sometimes we have to work with people we don't like. Someone else had to deal with this girl and now it is your turn. Her not doing her job is not an excuse for you to not do yours. Calling out was childish and sitting in the break room is childish. Do your damn job or quit. Either the job is worth it and you suck it up or it isn't and you walk away. If everyone has a problem then you should all get together and talk to the owners. If they won't do something then leave.

I'm not saying you're wrong or that I'm not an asshole, but look at it this way and let me know if you feel the same:

You're doing tasks X, Y, and Z and making 15 dollars an hour for years. One day your boss says to you, ""In addition to X, Y, and Z I need you to do A, B, and C. Oh.. and we're paying you 7 dollars an hour now.""

IMO, it's literally not worth my time and is actually pretty insulting because I've been there longer than any current busboy (and I'm going to sound like a tool, but people WANT me as their busboy on busy nights/parties because I'm a good worker) and they put me on these shifts.

As for the, ""Someone else had to deal with this girl, now it's your turn."" Those people that dealt with her weren't aware of how badly they were being shafted. After months of getting morning shifts, they'd get a night shift and I'd basically tell them repeatedly, ""that's not your job."" When they got the tips at the end of the night their eyes would get wide like they couldn't believe it.

What you want is fine, you're not automatically entitled to it.

You can be polite, clearly state what you would like (privacy) and why you would like it (adults should have privacy).

""I really don't think an adult should share a room with children"".

""I really don't think two single adults should share a room"".

""I really don't think an adult should be sleeping in the living room"".

""We originally discussed having privacy, is there any other option?"".

In a situation like this, ""getting what you want"" is what can make you an asshole, it's not about you, it's about what you think is appropriate.

4vpuln,"So I don't think your an asshole on the surface, but how you handle the situation has definite asshole potential. 

Since your already being proactive, check and see if there are any hotels a reasonable distance from the beach house first. If there are, go have a private conversation with your friend, and just let him know that if things at the house get tight you have another place to stay lined up. That way if you get there and things aren't what you expect you can graciously give up your room and just move on to the hotel. ",Human
4vpuln,"I think you gotta +1 on the asshole vote, mate..

I'm talking from experience. I've gone on many trips with total strangers (0 friends), have shared a room with them, and have come back with many new friends.  

Consider these before making a move:

1. I don't understand your justification for wanting a separate room. Look, there is 14 people and only a limited amount of bedrooms. You have to understand that even if you pay for that extra added premium ™, it's not like magically a new bedroom is built for you in the house. You requesting a separate bedroom equals someone else not having a place to sleep at night. Think about that before bugging someone with your request. 
2. You gotta stop with the negativity. You are going there on a friends trip. You are not going to hook up. There is nothing wrong with sleeping next to another dude (unless you get raging gay feelings in the middle of the night, in which case I wouldn't even recommend going on this trip anyway). Stop watching stupid movies. No one is going to draw a dick on your face if you're passed out. (And why in hell do you want to get passed out drunk instead of having fun?)
3. Accept that you are going on a vacation with others. Be considerate. Just like you, every one else is there to relax and take their mind off the daily struggles. Don't be a hassle to people. Don't be that one person who ruins it for every one else.
4. Accept that you are not in your house and don't expect the same luxuries you have there. There",Human
4vpuln,"I don't think you ARE an asshole, but if you dig your feet in and refuse to share a room you will probably end up being one.  The thing about beach houses is they are designed to cram the max number of people into rooms because the rooms are only used for sleeping and changing.  If you want a single room you might end up with an extra bed while someone is on the couch or in an uncomfortable/awkward pairing.

Gauge the general feeling of the party.  If you are feeling frustration/resentment from people, consider getting a nearby hotel if privacy is that important.  Putting people out when invited on a vacation is being a poor guest, and a sure way of making sure you are not invited back.  If it works out fine that you get your own room, make sure you express to your friend and his family your gratitude.",Human
4vpuln,"Asshole, or at least the ability to be one.  I would be surprised if there are more than 5 bedrooms in the beach house.  The idea that one entire bedroom is dedicated to a single person reduces the capacity of the house from 16 to about 12 or 13.  If there are 14 people going, there will already be people sleeping on blow up mattresses/futons/hide-a-bed.
If you want to go, suck it up.  Otherwise stay home or get a nearby hotel.

But since you're only making about $70 a week, it's not really worth it.  If you don't have public transit in your area, and you can't get a ride or your parents can't take you, it almost doesn't seem worth it to have a job.",Human

There's also other methods of transport that are cheaper than a car. How far away is your work? If under 10 miles, you could start cycling. You could also look at getting a moped or something - much cheaper than a car fuel wise, much cheaper insurance - though I live in the UK and basing that on costs over here.

The rent hike because of the AC in particular is fucked since there are 7 people in the house. What tops it off is that the kid purposely keeps him room closed so none of the air gets to the other people unless they want to pay $200 to help him cover his AC he's not supposed to have.

He made, what could have been a simple conversation, into a bigger problem by involving his landlord. No, he didn't owe the guy anything, but adulting isn't just about who you owe, it's about being a decent person with the balls (or ovaries) to use your words instead of being a chickenshit tattletale.

No, but you are under contract to tell them anything that's wrong with the property or anyone contravening the tenancy agreement.

We're not talking ""they said nasty things to me so I'm going to tell on you"", we're talking constant and significant infractions of the rental agreement such as could detriment their ability to continue living in this property.

4vvtll,"Jesus Christ you're obsessed with making this about being a ""wuss"" aren't you? For someone claiming to act like an adult you really don't speak like one. This isn't high school.

In a different situation because the sink wasn't actually leaking and causing damage I may have waited longer, but I'm a small girl in a new city and he was leaving for four days with
 a front door that didn't lock.  

I'm not going about this maliciously, if I came across like I was in my post it's from my frustration of the disgusting animal smell I've been trying to clean since I moved in.  Im disappointed that i ended up in this situation.  His hamster cage was breeding flies. 

I didn't talk to him about his air conditioning causing a rent increase.  He made it clear he wasn't sharing unless I forked over way to much cash plus it pisses me off knowing that a cooler house could help with the litter smells. And I really don't feel it's fair to keep it front the landlord (which he would have done, he lied to her about how the sink got messed up) and have the apartment below us pay for it.


And I do agree that if I hadn't tried to speak to him first I would be an asshole.  This guy is the type that wants as little contact with the landlord as possible.

4vvtll,"I did speak with him quite a few times. Sorry, I should have put that in my post.

If I only had an agreement with my roommate I might have left it alone but I signed a lease with the landlord.  My deposit is fairly big and I really don't want to/can't afford to lose it due to him being negligent.  

There's also the fact that he broke the sink by taking it apart when he didn't know what he was doing, then expected someone else to put it back together.  He didn't ask if someone else could, he washed his hands of it and said it wasn't his problem anymore then refused to call the landlord because he didn't want to piss her off.

It also cost a bit of money in supplies to fix.  If he was refusing to do it and the landlord wasn't called that would have came out of mine or the other roommates pocket.",Human

Unless the position she referred you for reports to her in some fashion, she likely wasn't involved enough in the hiring process to know when they were interviewing.  The fact that a position would be opening up is the sort of thing that would come up in a staff meeting, but after that it gets iffy.  Should she have told you the minute she found out the position was filled?  Yes.  But you can't expect her to know what's going on with the day-to-day business of another department.

That being said, you really need to cut her off, money-wise.  There's absolutely no reason why anyone who makes that much more than you do should be coming up short, especially if she doesn't have unusual or unexpected expenses.  And, given that she's a total flake, you might consider cutting contact with her entirely.

Does the context change, and I should have mentioned, that she works in an office where I would work alongside her and the hiring manager? That being said though, perhaps the regional manager was conducting interviews out of a different office. I FELT like she could have said something without stretching her boundaries like ""My boss has mentioned that she's too busy to interview"" or ""Apparently, the regional manager is conducting the interviews'. The last gal that worked there got fired for fraud, and... My friend crossed a lot of lines for telling me specifics that she said she shouldn't have. I almost felt like she was being purposely tight lipped about it. She never went so far to even say that she didn't know anything. 

To answer your question, I have worked for this current employer for exactly three months. I started voicing concerns around a month in, but remained very diplomatic. I was assured that things would change... but they haven't. They got worse. SOME THINGS/PEOPLE have improved, but the people and things have gotten worse. I'm never the squeaky, annoying wheel but rather carefully pick my battles when she seeks out conversations with us (we have 1 on 1 conversations once a month, otherwise she is very absent in the daily operations.

You hear *everything* in a cube farm.  (Half my staff was treated to a story about an executive's pubic hair once.  I was halfway across the office or I'd have had the pleasure, too.  I'm told the fact that I complained to HR on my staff's behalf made this executive cry.)

Back on track... With this new info, it sounds to me like your friend kept you out of the loop on purpose to avoid any backlash for what she might have said to you about it.  Either way, you're right, it sounds shady.

As for your current manager, nice and caring doesn't mean diddly if she's not willing to do what needs to be done to make the work environment productive, healthy, and above all, non-toxic.  Passive emails have never gotten anything done, and if that's the only trick she's got up her sleeve, she shouldn't be managing.

If you were going to stay there, I'd suggest going over her head with full documentation of the hostility that surrounds you.  Not worth it for you, though, because even if you did so anonymously, they'd likely pin you right out the gate.  Instead, you should ramp up your job search aggressively - and leave your current workplace off of your resume.

Was this while you were in a relationship? If you were trying to start an open relationship, then he clearly wasn't the person to start one with.

4wb3qq,"Have to agree with /u/targren. Those aren't valid reasons to fire somebody. More like valid reasons to get him into shape and correct those behaviors. Maybe confront him or his boss and tell him the dude needs a bath and he needs to clean up those sandwiches. Confront his behavior, instead of trying to fire him. ",Human
4wb3qq,"Asshole.
First it seemed like a legit complaint. However, not comprehending why crappy free food is more appealing than crappy paid food for your employees shows a lack of understanding people and empathy. Maybe he's just leaving it there because throwing it away is a waste and people appreciate it. 
Your hate of fat people isn't a real reason why he's bad at his job. 

Try asking the employees to clean up the fridge since they're the ones grabbing it. ",Human

Also, don't punish the vendor (Pepsi) for fixable habits of a single employee - that's really an asshole move.

Source: I work in a similar industry and would seriously want to know so I could fix the issue.  The sloppy appearance wouldn't be enough to fire someone but there would be a serious discussion about company image &amp; personal hygiene.  Now, giving away food instead of disposing of it as per company policy... that might be a more substantial threat to his livelihood.

Actually, that's all probably the best way to handle it. Not everyone has to like everyone.

What food is he bringing in anyway? Expiration dates are usually a joke, especially with junk food, so it's probably not like people are eating literal trash. Unless it's something that can go bad by being unrefrigerated, you're probably making a bigger deal about it than most people would. Again, best to leave that to other people to deal with.

I have to believe there is alot coming from prior arguments or conversations where she has asked you to stop questioning everything she says and you have done nothing to change it. This whole wall of text comes across as much deeper than this conversation. You should start with apologizing for hurting her feelings. You didn't say anything wrong but stubbornly standing by it does not help your relationship either. You are at a cross roads with her it appears. You can accept you aren't infallible and try to work with her on your shortcomings or you can stand on a soapbox alone stating how right you are. ",Human
4wbtlo,"First off, I don't think you're the asshole, mostly because I have the same nature of wanting things to be concrete and planned, and I don't like changing plans for things I'm excited about.

That being said, you both need to take a lesson in empathising with your partner.  When she was telling you that she was hurt and you were telling her that it wasn't your intention, that was pretty useless.  If I hit you in the head with an axe and tell you I didn't mean to, it doesn't make the pain any duller, you just want to hear me say ""sorry for hitting you in the head"", or you want to punch me in the face, one of the two.  

Another piece of advice is to take some time after an argument starts.  I know for myself and my wife that if we have an argument start and one of us is defensive, we like to wait a bit until our emotions aren't so raw and we can talk to each other about our intentions and stuff.  It's a lot easier to hear criticisms and apologies when you aren't really angry from a fight.  

Also, cut the passive aggressive, she was talking about how it was a possibility to visit her family, and all you said was ""so no cowboys game?"". Maybe instead of that say something along the lines of ""That's sweet!  I was really excited about the cowboys game tho, maybe we could reschedule Thanksgiving?"". And work out a compromise.

And wife is way more important than football too. How can you not know that? You don't treat her well. Start showing her some respect. And maybe even some affection.

But you know all this already. That's why you came to reddit and tried to get people to agree with you. What the hell do you care about the views of a bunch of redditors? If you were taking better care of your wife, you wouldn't even be talking about this.

You thought she was consenting. Learn from this experience to make sure you have consent in future. But you backed straight off as soon as she expressed that she wanted to stop, so you did the right thing there.",Human
4wv503,"Ah ""cue"", it was late. Though this was 2 years ago, just wanted to know if I was an ass or not, may seem stupid to apologize now.",Human

4wwlgb,"Not the asshole. You displayed a very mature, measured response to everything that happened, especially the overcharging of the tradesman. That's something that all homeowners seem to just have to put up with for an easy life.  
However I would have handled the irate phone call from the woman differently. You wouldn't have lost anything from just hanging up on her. It's frustrating to be harangued like that when you weren't deserving, but you would probably have pretty much forgotten about it by now and wouldn't have any kind of guilty conscience (not saying you should have).  
You may have even found by staying calm and not arguing back that she would have phoned back later with an apology. You would very much have been the victim.",Human
4wwlgb,"Of course I agree with how I should have handled the phone call in hindsight. I hate confrontations but I seem to be pretty bad at avoiding them when given the opportunity to in the heat of the moment.

How about the reviews? I think that's what I'm most conflicted about now. I feel I put them up originally as my only avenue of justice, But the more I think about it I really don't think anyone deserves that kind of treatment.",Human

4wwlgb,"Ugh if this only were the catalyst that allowed my mother to change her ways, it would retrospectively become one of the better things to happen to us.

She's one of those 'penny-wise dollar-poor' type people. She'll spend an entire day pursuing a 5 dollar rebate or refund, but then go to a shady car shop to do the cheapest repairs on her car that will end up costing her twice as much to re-fix later. She'll burn bridges over things like this when it's just so much less emotionally taxing to just let some things go.

It drives me and my father crazy, but she's incredibly stubborn and thinks that we all share her views, which causes her to do things like this.

I should talk to her about this... The way she described it, she contacted the electrician with a fairly innocent question. But I know her well enough that she likely exaggerated things to make herself look better.",Human

4wwlgb,"As an electrician, you're not the asshole. I mean, yeah your mom shouldn't have done what she did. The 150 is pretty reasonable for what they did, but if she told you one price and added extra shit on top without mentioning it that's pretty uncool. I can't really blame you for your reaction to her either, you by no means deserved to be yelled at for whatever is your mom said. I'd take your side on this over a fellow electrician. ",Human

4wwlgb,"Not the asshole, you were deliberately provoked.  Leaving bad reviews and swearing is a reasonable response to a boatload of verbal abuse that you tried to get past like a mature adult. 

It would have been better to take the high road here, but I think what you did was fairly reasonable. ",Human
4wwlgb,"Firstly, where does your mother get off sticking her nose in after you repeatedly told her not to? That woman needs to be put in her place. Period. 

Secondly, you have no idea how your mother spoke to that woman, but judging by the call you received as a consequence and the fact that your mother is already the kind of person to disregard personal boundaries, I can only imagine what she said. 

Third, she called you a misogynist for your female oriented slurs? So, you called her a cunt or bitch on the phone? I mean, I can understand that you were probably minding your own business when a crazy person rang to accost you, and that you were probably taken aback and heated over it, but I feel like we're missing some critical info about how this was handled. It's easy to compose your thoughts rationally once you're distanced from a situation, but I wonder how that call really went down. 

And lastly, what are they over charging you for? Like you said, if the call was to be charged, surely they could have mentioned that during the call. And on what planet do you have a pay dispute with a customer and decide to call them up and scream at them? Again, I can only imagine what your mother said, but either way, there are legal, professional avenues to follow and screaming isn't one of them. 

Sounds like a whole bunch of miscommunication with a sprinkle of assholery from everyone involved. ",Human
4wwlgb,"Thanks for providing a different perspective than the consensus. While I did try to provide as accurate a portrayal as far as I saw, I agree that I don't know for sure what my mother said to them.

The specific phrase that I said to her was 'You are a fucking bitch', after which she repeated it back to me, and repeat that sequence until the call ended. But in any case, as far as how the call came into me and how I responded to it, I'm as accurate as I can be here, even going so far as to identify my less-than-proud moments.

They certainly did not say they would charge me for the phone call while I was on the phone. They specifically said $75-$90 for them to come to my house and diagnose the issue. It was also said that if there was more they needed to do that we would re-evaluate. As far as I know the only thing that occurred was the diagnosis so that was where my expectation was. The only other possibility I could put together from the confusing communication after the fact was that there was a charge for the initial late-night call for the appointment/troubleshooting that was not clearly stated in the phone call. In any case I had no problem paying the extra, if that's what it was. There was just confusion as to what the extra charge was for and the provided receipt did not indicate it at all.

But thanks for playing devil's advocate in this case. I'm certain there's something I could or should have done differently here to prevent this situation and yours and other's comm",Human

- You find out that the down payment was never made

- Customer is pissed and trying to rebook the room

4wy2hx,"I think you're both kind of assholes but I'm honestly leaning toward you being more in the wrong here. The fact he was able to book without hitting a roadblock for non-payment shows a significant flaw in your system, and when a company is the one responsible for the mistake, they need to make it right. On the other hand, the guy clearly knew he got away with something and went as far as admitting to it and telling you he just refuses to follow policy.

Fucking bullshit: You book someone's room, realize *the next year* that you forgot, call him up and say he owes you money he didn't know about and he needs to pay you within 48 hours, cancel his reservation because he said no, force him to pay you more for your mistake.

I'm from the suburbs where everyone lives in a house and I'm really not familiar at all with typical apartment manners when it comes to this sort of thing.

Be conscious of what *time* it is when you decide to use your speakers. It's understood that you'll deal with noise living in an apartment building, but in my experience there's an unspoken rule that the sound turns down when the sun goes down.

The easiest thing you can do is leave a note with your phone # and telling people to call or text if there's any problem like noise or a leak. ",Human
4wyf4t,"I used to be a lot more upset about other people's noises, but I've mellowed out since college. Part of apartment life is living in close proximity with other people and I had to learn that I can't control them. 

Nowadays, if I can't hear music from inside my apartment with the windows closed, I'm happy. Be aware that bass carries really well, though. (It bugs the crap out of me, and earplugs don't do much to filter it out.)",Human
4wyf4t,"I don't think you're the asshole here.

Throughout my childhood and college dorm/apartment life I had to deal with people making an inconsiderate amount of noise. I used to have serious difficulty sleeping with too much noise, so it was very frustrating for me, especially when I'd politely ask them to turn it down. I'd frequently get dirty looks, or they would turn the volume down a fraction and think that was enough, and the volume would almost always return the next day.

I had to learn to deal with it. I invested more than I probably should have had to into noise cancelling headphones, earplugs, etc.

But in those cases I always at least said something to those people. And I tried to be considerate of respecting their right to make noise during normal hours. If school wasn't in vacation, and it was Sunday-Thursday after 11:00, I had no reservations asking for quiet.

I had to be realistic, they were dorms, college apartments, and I should expect a certain amount of noise. It was my own choice to live there.

You at least sound like you are cognizant of the disruption noise causes, but if they don't speak up and you're not living in a retirement home, then I'd say the responsibility is one them to at least say something.

Likewise, I think the responsibility is on you to introduce yourself to your new neighbors and see what their boundaries are in terms of volume. They'll probably appreciate getting to know their new neighbor and you may even hit it off and get some new fri",Human

Certainly the grad student should have told you to turn it down.  I can't imagine being annoyed by loud music and not complaining for, what, nine months?  But a lot of people put up with a lot of shit to avoid any kind of confrontation.

I think if you have had a calm conversation about why you'd like him to see a doctor (it would help both of you) and how his non-management of his illness affects you and he still refuses, it would be reasonable for you to decide that you can't deal with it and make it clear to him what you will do if he doesn't get help. You should also talk to him about why he refuses to see a doctor - it's possible he's scared of what the diagnosis might be and worried about how his lifestyle might have to change or what the treatments might be. Maybe he's worried he can't afford treatment and it'd be better not to know. People can be very illogical about this kind of thing.

To me its like the basic foundation, if you aren't happy with the way you are with yourself (physically or emotionally) then you need to do something about it. Yes I know it is selfish of me but it's difficult when he won't even try to get help. It would be different if he actually got help and got diagnosed, at least we would be trying to work on together.

He still wasn't feeling well so he didn't go to work again but while I was at work I wrote out long texts to him about not understanding his avoidance of going to see a doctor and how he wouldn't be able to fix this on his own and that it is better to get a diagnosis no matter how terrible it may be because at least we can start treatments asap.,Human

4x1lc5,"In my opinion, it's really difficult to assign asshole status without a lot of details. I certainly wouldn't say you're the asshole simply for reminding someone about polite pronoun use. I think whether you're an asshole here depends on your intention and how you handled the situation. First, you mention ""calling him out,"" which, to me, suggests more than a helpful correction, so red flag there. If you took an offensive tone from the start or escalated unnecessarily, you may be the asshole.

Moreover, he's your brother, so there's a good chance you could gauge his reaction ahead of time. Did you know he was likely to react with offense? Some people just cannot handle having their beliefs questioned under any circumstances, much less when caught off-guard in a group situation. If this is the case, and you knew it, I think there's a better case for your being the asshole. You can't choose your family, so sometimes it's better just to let things lie, or, if need be, save the conversation for a one-on-one sometime. 

FWIW, I see your brother's code switching argument as technically valid, but unnecessarily convoluted and ultimately unworkable, unless he's willing to ensure every private conversation he has is with people who share his disdain for changing pronouns (at which he has obviously failed already).

4x1lc5,"Allow me to clarify. First, I did not mean to suggest that code switching is bad. Code switching is a normal and arguably necessary part of communication. What I intended to say was that this specific type of code switching, wherein someone regularly and intentionally refers to a certain group by offensive terms in private and by polite terms in public, is ultimately unworkable for the simple reason that one can not always know who will be offended by a certain term. Obviously OP is an example here. He is not transgender, but he was offended by his brother's insistence on impolite pronouns. Likewise, as a white, cis, heterosexual male, I have found myself in uncomfortable conversations about nearly all types of minority groups. With certain groups, one cannot be sure if the person they are talking to is a member of a minority group.

I'm also not saying that there's no place for offensive terms. In the right situation, offensive terms can be used effectively and non-hurtfully for humor or other purposes, even by out-group members.

I worked for years at a job like this, and got comfortable with payroll hitting my bank early. Then one day it didn't and put me in a real bind, after that I shifted things were in my mind, payday was was on Friday and not an earlier day.

In fact, the delay can very well be on *your* bank's side and have nothing to do with the company's payroll system. 

I also have to pose a question to you here - if he moved payday to Thursday, what would it change? The interval between payday stays the same. The amount stays the same.

Having had anxiety issues throughout my life, I know it's been the cause of many unfortunate times. Times when all I had to do was just to enjoy myself and I couldn't even do that. And one of the problems in mitigating anxiety is that there's not really a ""one-size fits all"" treatment/cure. For some people the best treatment is counseling, therapy, and possibly even medication. For others it's a drastic life change in routine, habits, and external triggers.

For me, I've found that my anxiety never *really* goes away. I don't want to sound discouraging, but I'd rather just be completely honest here. The best treatment I've had for anxiety has been finding the correct amount of balance in my daily routine and diet. Admittedly, I never had much luck with anything thing else. Though, it's tough to say that at certain times in my life I could still find the same kind of balance.

4xmp4p,"Thank you so much for responding, it means a lot to me that you read through my whole story to help me. 

When you say that you don't think it needs to be a big deal, do you think I should casually apologize (""oh hey, by the way, I am sorry about what I said the other day"") or that I should be a bit more formal? I apologized as soon as I saw that she was angry, and she seemed to ignore it, so she might prefer that I be a bit more formal.  ",Human
4xmp4p,"I agree except for the ""You're a teenager"" part. At 16 anyone is old enough to know where the responsibilties and blame falls. I'm not trying to be rude, but OP should have known from the start that they were in the wrong.

Sorry if that was blunt, but that's the best way to give advice like this. Everyone does things that they shouldn't, but its all about how you handle the consequences. I'd apologize as soon as you can and just don't do it again.",Human
4xmp4p,"Definitely make sure it's genuine, explain that you understand that you weren't being wholly cooperative and that you're sorry but don't put any undue stress on yourself over it.",Human
4xmp4p,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. You're right, I was being immature. I'll apologize again the next time I see her. ",Human
4xmp4p,"I might have to disagree. At 16, people are still in that highschool mindset and definitely see the world differently than someone older (like OP's mom). 

I am not saying what they did was the right thing but I think what OP did made sense given lack of experience of doing this stuff in a real world setting (no offense OP, don't take it personally) but I don't think any of this was the point really so I'll just stop typing",Human
4xmp4p,"I don't think you're an asshole, but why don't you get a bicycle until you start driving?  Just know that OLD PEOPLE FORGET WHAT THEY SAY, **AND** THEY ALSO CHANGE THEIR MINDS.  Also take note that pointing out either of these two facts to them by telling them EXACTLY what they said is only going to piss them off.  Try not to be emotional about it, work on finding your own transportation asap.",Human
4xmp4p,"I suppose to a degree. It really depends on the person, and what I was getting at is everyone has the potential to be mature enough to handle a situation like this properly.

Off topic, but this is what I love about reddit. People can disagree without being rude and having a pissing contest about it.",Human
4xmp4p,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but you are the asshole here.  Take heart, though; I don't think it was deliberate, it's more that difficult transition between childhood and adulthood when we go from having all our needs taken care of by others to having to take care of them ourselves.  If I can give advice, I'd suggest that your apology goes something like this- ""I'm sorry, Mom.  I was childish and really dropped the ball on the transportation issue.  It was my responsibility to figure out how to get to and from work and instead I made it yours.  That was wrong of me and then I doubled down by being a brat about it.  Now that I see that I want to assure you that I have learned my lesson and I hope you can forgive me for how I behaved.  I love you so much and appreciate all you do for me.  I especially appreciate how patient you are when I mess up like this.""  

Learning the art of graceful apology and when to take responsibility is an important life skill.  It sounds as if you may be arriving there early than many people do.  Congratulations.",Human
4xmp4p,"Thanks for responding. I think you're right, the reason my mom ignored both of my apologies was because they didn't sound genuine enough. When I apologize later today, I will try to be more heartfelt. Thanks so much for the advice. ",Human
4xmp4p,"The reason I don't use a bike is because I would have to lock it in a shady part of town, and I'd rather not have it stolen or damaged. And you're right, she might have forgotten what she said, and I certainly shouldn't have brought it back up. Thanks very much for responding. ",Human
4xmp4p,"Thanks for saying this. I never tried to be malicious, and I never tried to be ""smart"" with her. At the time, I wasn't trying to be lazy or anything, I really thought that I wasn't doing anything wrong... I see my mistake, though, and am going to sit her down and genuinely apologize once more for the entire situation. Thank you for responding. ",Human
4xmp4p,"So, read your update and I think it's best for you to just let this one go. At this point, it seems to me your mom may be being just a little bit petty. Is she a housewife by any chance? If she'd forgotten about the issue at all and that got mad about still anyway after your attempt to apologize, she just needs to be given a little time to stew till she's done and this should blow over.

You didn't really screw up. Regardless of how your mom is acting, you really honestly didn't ""really screw up."" You were a bit inconsiderate and a bit irresponsible. Right on par with your average 16-year-old, no offense meant. Take this lesson, learn from it, move forward. Make a point to continue to be as polite and friendly with your mom as you ever were and she will come around when she's had time to get over it.

If she never outright accepts your apology, that's fine, don't let it get to you. Let it be a learning experience and make it water under the bridge.",Human
4xo8mq,"No, you are most definitely not the asshole.  From your post, it's clear that the two of you haven't pooled resources and expenses.  And expecting someone else, even a significant other, to cough up thousands of dollars is inappropriate as hell.  Especially when the relationship is rocky.

Also, the whole ""it was just a test"" thing shows a serious lack of maturity on her part.  I highly doubt it was a test, and whether it was or not, throwing a fit about not being able to be with someone who wouldn't empty his savings account for her is a huge sign she's a gold-digger.

So no, you are not the asshole, and after the show she put on I'd seriously think about kicking her to the curb if I were you.",Human
4xo8mq,"Thanks for your input. I've been thinking about kicking her to the curb, but I can't find the courage to do it. I usually just ignore her until she finds the maturity to apologize, but if I don't accept her apology right away, she goes back to being mad at me. It's been like this for a long time and it really takes its toll.",Human
4xo8mq,Nta. Curb her. Nuf said.,Human
4xo8mq,"Just a heads up, in case you don't know: that whole, ""I have my answer"" is a common manipulation tactic. Don't fixate on what she means or what she's thinking - it's a game. You're right, she's wrong. ",Human
4xo8mq,"Just end it man. It's so easy to find someone to screw around with and get over her these days. 6 years is more than some marriages and it will hurt but if you're stuck unhappy and being taken advantage of just move on. That said I'm just some asshole on reddit giving advice on a situation I'm not in so it's easy for me to say but would be really hard for you to do. I'm sure you know if she's what you want forever or not. Maybe the good outweighs the bad, but if you're not with someone you think you want forever at this point, can her. Go bang tinder girls and enjoy some freedom and the relief from the pressure of a nagging bitch. I've been there- if you can't tell. If you do end it be sure about it and don't look back. ",Human
4xo8mq,"Thank you. I don't want to drone on about my relationship, but I rarely have anyone in my corner. I don't ever talk about my relationship problems with friends or family, because she gets mad at me, but she likes to try to rally people behind her opinion pretty often. I always hear, ""Well, my sister said this and my friend said that and they agree with me."" ",Human
4xo8mq,"You express yourself well, so try not to sell yourself short. Good luck. ",Human
4xo8mq,You should dump that bitch dude.,Human
4xo8mq,Might just do that lol,Human
4xo8mq,"No, she is definitely the asshole here. She is manipulating you by trying to make it seem like you are unreasonable for not helping her. She isn't asking for help. She is insisting you do something she knows you can't do to prove your love. This is a huge red flag. It is like the girls who say they are cheating to see your response and then claim they just wanted to know if you love them and will fight for them. She is gaslighting you. This isn't healthy at all.

Why are you staying with someone you don't get along with. I understand six years is a long time, but it sounds like you would rather be with someone who is bad for you than to be alone. It is not worth being this miserable and dealing without someone who is clearly more worried about her own wants and needs than yours. It is your life, but I would seriously contemplate why you are with someone who treats you this way. You deserve better than this.",Human
4xo8mq,"So she starts arguments like this, gaslights you and tries to isolate you from any kind of support system? These are all big red flags. I don't want to tell you what to do, but this sounds pretty damned abusive. You may want to give this website a look and if it sounds like your relationship it may be time to reevaluate things. If you ever need someone to talk to I am here any time. I mean it. It is possible to be in an abusive relationship and not know the signs. You are not alone and there is help out there.

She seems like a massive bitch; you don't just ask (read: tell) someone else to buy you a car. If you two had a central savings account and combined finances, sure, I could see someone in a strong relationship saying ""Let's use what's in our savings to buy me a new car."" But that not being the case, she's batshit for feeling entitled to such a huge monetary commitment from you when the two of you don't get along. You are not EVEN the asshole here, but you are a little dense if you don't get out of this manipulative arrangement. Best of luck.",Human

You knew he had plans for that day and still did not bother to plan ahead. Under these circumstances you have to be willing to make compromises as you can't expect him to alter his plans for you (although it would have been nice if he had).

But like I said the main reason I consider you an asshole is your attitude. Your whole post sounds like you are trying to make your friend appear like an asshole, even though in the end he did delay his plans and waited with you.

In the end, I would say you are the asshole in this situation. Not for ""wanting your friend to slightly inconvenience himself for you"" but for forcing your friend to change his plans for you and then bashing him because he's unhappy with it.",Human

Is 30 miles really a lot of gas? I don't know. I drive an old truck, I get less than 20 miles to the gallon. Let's call it 15. Even then that's less than ten extra bucks of gas, and a half hour or so of time. 

I think this was poor communication and planning, they should have sorted it out before hand. Lesson learned.

A lot of people treat front line service workers like that's exactly their job and it does kind of sound like that's what #2 was doing. It's not okay to shit on service workers and this attitude is what makes people think it is. 

You don't have to be polite, put on a happy face or pretend like there's nothing wrong with being a dick to others for no reason. You just have to not be an asshole or hostile back, and that's where OP went wrong. That said, with salty assholes like that guy, it's just simply more fun to be overly polite.

Escalate it next time. Ask for his manager or leave a comment card, explain you complied with every rule albeit not immediately. Don't engage with irrational people.",Human
4xslyd,"As a theater employee, we get fired if underage people are caught in rated R movies without parents with them. It's a liability thing, I guess parents have won or threatened lawsuits for letting their angels watch a traumatic movie.

This includes making sure that the adults with the underage people in the movie don't leave. It happens a lot, a fake out of sorts. They buy tickets, watch the first 10 minutes, leave and then come back at the end to pick the kids up. We can't allow it.

Besides, most underage people in R movies have causes us serious issues. Screaming, on phones, throwing things around the theater, etc. Then we have to refund 100+ tickets because some 14 year old really had to see ""The Conjuring.""",Human

If he was a manager there is not much you can do, but if the adult in the situation didn't feel the need to contact management about the behavior you should have left it alone. You can report the behavior, but calling the guy out was shitty and he could have banned you and been well within his right to do so.",Human
4xslyd,"I worked at a theatre for four years. Teenagers cause problems. Manager was being cautious because of your age. He's right that you should have read the signs and paid attention to the rules.

The manager has every right to deny you entry of course,  but the rude way he choose to do so from the beginning of the story, and the following you outside make him the asshole.

While I do think you could have been nicer, I think asshole is too strong a word here",Human
4xslyd,"But to follow the kids outside and bother them about the sign again seems unnecessary and rude, no?",Human
4xslyd,"Oh, yes. I never just assume people aren't old enough to watch the movie to start with, I just ask to see ID and let them know if they ""forgot"" that they can't watch it unless with someone 21 or older (as policy at my theater).

This manager was very excessive and rude, but was still technically doing his job. I've checked up on groups of kids multiple times during movies before, but usually just walking into the theater, looking for them, watching a moment and moving on unless I need to intervene.

Manager was an asshole, but was probably having a long day. I can't tell you how many underage kids I've turned away from Sausage Party this weekend. Add that to being a manager, which means that angry customers who think their popcorn is stale or didn't like their movie or thought it was too cold/hot in the theater etc etc and it's easy to see how a manager has it a lot worse than a minimum wage person like me.

Does it excuse his behavior? No. But he's human like the rest of us. He shouldn't have gone as far as he did, and OP shouldn't have gone off on him. Would have been better to have a civil conversation, probably would have resulted in an apology or even refund tickets.",Human

Being annoyed is normal reaction, it's your actions that decide whether you're an asshole, typically, and in this case you made a pretty reasonable request and offered to pay for gas. Your friend is within her rights to refuse, though in her situation I would have driven over to you. But who knows, maybe she honestly was so tired she felt her attention would be lacking on the road. I don't know. The lesson you've learnt is to stick to your guns - next time put your keys in your bag or keep them on you and if you think you're likely to forget something, take steps to prevent it. My family keeps a spare key hidden on the property (not near the front door) just in case. You can buy Key safes too if you're worried about security.",Human
4xssp4,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say that while you're not the asshole *for being pissed off* because you can't help the way you feel, you are the asshole for relinquishing personal responsibility for something that only you need.

She shouldn't have given you a hard time for wanting to walk back to her car so you could drop off your keys.  If she didn't want to walk back to her car with you she could have met you in the store.  That's where she was the asshole.

But you were the asshole for letting your keys go out of your possession.  You said your keychain was bulging out of your pocket - do you own a warehouse or something?  This doesn't seem like a one-time issue - you should get a more manageable keychain or manage your keys better so you're not constantly dealing with this problem.  

It's never a good idea to assume someone else will be responsible for something that only you need - whether it's an epi pen, a credit card, your housekeys - these things should stay under your own control at all times.  You can't blame someone else for forgetting.

It would have been *nice* for your friend to drive your keys to you.  I'd even go as far as saying it would have been *the right thing to do*.

4xu9nq,"Sorry, but I think you're the asshole. If you don't like the GM's rules, you don't play. Simple as that. Especially if you weren't already in the middle of a campaign. 

That aside, as someone who has never played Shadowrun and is going purely off of your description, I get the point you're trying to make from a meta perspective, and can understand that it would create a rift between magical vs physical characters, but from a lore perspective, I can see how your GM may set a rule like that. If you would rather power game than enjoy the lore, maybe he wasn't the right GM for you.

**EDITED:** OP didn't harm other players, argument was over Skype.",Human
4xu9nq,"&gt; fellow players had to just sit twiddling their thumbs so you could get your way?

We haven't had a session yet, the game starts next week, this was in messages through Skype, and its not hard to lower your essance to sub 1 at gen and make a sub optimal character, for example I had a 0.65 essance character and all it took to get there was replace all 4 limbs and upgread the replacements to slightly better than before.

I'm not really asking if I was an asshole, I know I was, it's more if it was justifiable.

Edit: if it was during a session it came up I would have waited, I've been on the waiting an listening side of that before.",Human
4xu9nq,"Well, it's good that you weren't hurting any other players, so that makes it less bad. I still feel like arguing a rule for several hours that was made pre-campaign is never justified. If any rule is that much of a dealbreaker for you, don't play. 

Again, I still feel like it's a matter of playstyle. There are lore benefits to what the GM is doing. It's like a DM saying you can't make a Chaotic Evil character. Your GM is saying you need to be at least ""this much"" human. I'm not saying the rule is right or wrong, just that the GM had a vision and wanted it that way, so if you don't want that, don't play, and find a campaign that fits your views better.",Human

While lobbying the GM for stuff is a fun part of any game, and something all of my groups do to some extent, you should be prepared to take ""no"" for an answer. Part of the payoff of being GM is deciding how you want the world. If you want a particular ruling or thing, then you should be prepared to run a game with that.

As a rule of thumb, I'll send one ""Hey, can we have [thing]?"" message, and maybe one ""C'mooon, [thing] is totes balanced. Pretty please?"" message, if the GM is someone I know well and I really want the thing. ",Human

I do understand what you mean though, wish my parents were divorced tbh",Human
4y3oeb,"Yaaa.. but what he does with his money is his business- not yours. Do you live at home still? Do you pay rent?  Do you pay partial utilities?  How much your dad makes doesnt determine how much  weight you pull.  If the car was in his name, and he sold it and got you a different car- its still all his call.

4y3oeb,"I understand your point of view, and it's not a nice situation it looks like. But then let's not mix multiple issues: you seem to think that your father is a no good man who makes questionable choices. Then why milking him for money? We're taking about fixing a car door, that's hardly an investment, maybe if you did figure out how to get this small thing done without anyone else's help (go to a bodyshop, ask them how much, get the money, get it fixed) he would be more inclined to help you. In his mind he's probably thinking: Let's see if the (insert non-flattering term) can get that one simple thing fixed by himself. If you think your father is a loser (and I would suggest you think long and hard before you jump to conclusions), why do you think it's OK to be even more of a loser by being unable to solve an issue that is totally under your control without running back to ask papa for dindins? What do you think he thinks of you? The fact that you're complaining about the licence plate not being screwed in is not boding well, it takes a screwdriver to fix it, do you really want him to do it for you? ",Human

4y3oeb,"The fact that while trying to seem humble you still blame everything on him instead of taking what adults call ""personal accountability"" (while still complaining about something essentially given to you for nothing more than existing) doesn't make you an asshole, it just makes you extremely naive to how the rest of your life will be structured. Stop trying to make it seem like he does not care about you. The sooner you drop your victim complex the easier everything will be. He gets to do what he wants with his money, why not do what you want with yours and fix the car. It's almost asinine that you are complaining about having to fix a license plate issue that literally takes a screwdriver. Think about it. Is this you actually wanting advice, or more so just looking for somewhere to vent?",Human
4y3oeb,"A bit of both. I was just mad at the time of posting that strangers and my siblings get treated better by him. Maybe it is selfish to expect my father to throw a little my way so I don't have to hold the door on the passengers side when I turn. I agree personal accountability is mine, I'll reach into my money and see what I can do about the door. I think I just wanted sympathy from people who had dads who didn't care for them/ or never show it",Human
4y3oeb,"You said he offered a crappy fix such as strapping the door shut. That does solve the problem of you literally having to hold the door closed. Now it just seems you want more luxury. To be honest I didn't even have my own car until 25 with no air conditioning and no heat and no amenities, and not a single bit of it was payed for by my parents because it had already been 10 years of me living on my own (moved out at 15) with no support whatsoever. Be happy with what you have, and be willing to fix what you think is wrong. Life isn't easy and this is by far not the hardest thing in life you will have to deal with no matter how rough it seems currently. All that aside I guarantee your father cares about you no matter how slighted you feel by his seemingly inability to understand your issues with the situation. Remember money spent does not mean affection showed. 

Edit: to be honest as it stands I work seriously 15-19 hours days at work to earn the salary I do, and if I was providing someone near free transportation and they complained about the things you are versus taking the responsibility themselves to fix, I would just take the gift back and then ask them where they stand.

I do get called in and feel obligated to go on my days off,  so I get that he feels that I put my job before my family sometimes. I just hate leaving people stuck shorthanded. It's different if we have plans or something,  but if I'm just sitting  around at home and they need me at work because someone is sick,  why not go in and make some extra money?

That said, please try to look at it from his perspective.  I'm a SAHM, and it's lonely.  It's exhausting.  It's boring.  I spend more days than not counting down the minutes until my husband gets home so I can talk to someone who answers back like a human and knows how to wipe his own ass.  I look forward to every second I have available to pee in peace, shower without worrying the house is getting trashed, and sit down for more than 45 seconds without hearing ""mama mama mama mama mama!""

No, you didn't have plans, you weren't screwing anything up, etc...  but he needs you home too.  Your kid needs you home.  Extra money is good and all, but if you can make your bills without it, consider that *time* with a little is something you'll never get back.  

Did you ask him if he was OK with you going in early?  Or did you just assume?  I get frustrated with my husband about him just making plans without consulting me all the time...  yes, I'm at home, odds are I'm not doing anything hugely important, but sometimes I am and sometimes I'd just like to be consulted before the schedule changes on me.

Granted, they jumped right to being rude and making assumptions about you as well, which is not a very mature reaction.  I would chalk you both up to being assholes, at least within the context of these comments and knowing nothing else about either of you, but being that the point of this is to give objective insight, maybe keep the accusations and name-calling to yourselves.

All that covered, my opinion is that the behavior is extremely creepy, even with just 20 photos as mentioned in another comment, and they should definitely stop, even if it's ""not hurting anyone"".  I don't feel that makes them a pedo, or puts them on a path to becoming one once they're older, but it's not a good practice.

For OP: You state that you're not hurting anyone, but how would you feel if a man was saving pictures you had on your facebook from when you were 16?  If you don't know, it wouldn't hurt you, but you have to acknowledge that it's not good behavior to get into.",Human

You're an asshole for sticking your nose in Anne's business, especially when Kelly told you not to say anything.

Kelly is an asshole for gossiping to both you and Trent.

Trent is an asshole for sticking his nose in it and his rude comments at you.

Anne is a bit of an asshole for getting upset with you, but you have to understand where she's coming from. To her, her boyfriend is the bees knees and she probably doesn't even notice he's being abusive. And if she does, she probably blames it on herself. That's very common in victims of abuse, be it physical or emotional.

I'm going to assume you're all in high school (at least I hope so, judging my the context of all this). In a few years, none of this will matter and, as harsh as this may come off, none of you might even be in contact with each other. But for future reference, try to stay out of drama. If someone starts to gossip to you, stop them in their tracks and tell them you want no part of it. You might feel ""out of the loop"" but trust me, you'll be happier.",Human
4yh519,"You are all at fault in my mind. You friend confided in you with information you shouldn't have, you chose to act on it and your other friend got rightfully angry. Later your boyfriend loosely did to you what you did to your friend. He should have respected your boundaries as you should have respected your friends. I can't explain his reaction afterwords which makes me think there's more to this story. Either he got some information he doesn't want you to know about (unlikely) or you came at him way to hard and ""demanded"" to see this conversation instead of politely asking. Y'all need to just drop the hostility and help your friend together now, bickering doesn't solve anyone's problems.",Human
4yh519,"To clarify, Kelly never acted secretive. She told me this information casually and didn't act like it was a secret, with that said, I brought this up to nobody but Anne.

Also, Anne was the one who started noticing the abusive signs herself and told Kelly her thoughts. I just care about Anne and I didn't want her to be in a situation that could be super dangerous.

2. No, you asked him not to get involved and he did. He has no right to tell you you're not allowed to get involved. If he's talking about you behind your back and won't let you know what he said then that is, to me, a red flag.

As for your boyfriend, it was a shitty reaction on his part, but perhaps you could have explained to him the situation somewhat and not demanded the phone, as it sounds like you did. But ya, the above poster is right in that the gossip is kind of getting out of hand, what is potentially a serious situation got kind of lost in it.",Human

In short, if we're talking about a legit abusive situation here, a whole lot of people are going to be pissed-off in the interest of stability, against their long-term interests, and breaking through that wall makes some rubble.

Boyfriend's a bit of an asshole, because he shouldn't be talking any shit regarding his SO that he wouldn't let her see, in the first place. If the relationship is anything deeper than transient or shallow, ""none of your business"" doesn't really fly.

3. It's not ok to be rude. So in this situation, you're being an asshole.

Your boyfriend is the type of person who talks about people behind their back, keeps secrets, and interjects himself where he doesn't belong. Depending on whether he was trying trying to make a point about privacy or if he was just trying to make you upset with whatever ammo he could find, he may be the type of person who is rude.

Kelly is the type of person who talks about people behind their back (telling Trent what you did). Depending on whether she was trying to stir up some drama or actually try to help Anne by telling you about Anne's abusive relationship, she may be the type of person who talks about people behind their back. Depending on if she just didn't want to lose face to Anne for talking about Anne behind her back or if she only didn't want you to bring up Anne's abusive relationship to Anne because she thought it would be unhelpful for Anne, she may also be the type of person who keeps secrets.

You grew up in, what sounds to be, a very emotionally and mentally abusive familial relationship. It sounds like your stepfather is struggling with control issues and is using it on you as an outlet. Does he treat your mother the same way that you can tell? If so, it is likely that she has been pathologically groomed to be responsive and reciprocal to his abuse; as a woman who survived an abusive relationship, it's pretty much brainwashing. If she is not a victim to these abusive tendencies, than your mother is the asshole.

She placed her children, and allowed them to continue to be raised in, an unstable environment. While she did respond to your suicide attempt, she should have taken into **very** serious account that you felt unsafe enough to be in that household.

Hatred is a very natural response to what you've been subjected to.

With that said: you need to leave. I understand you are saving up for a place of your own, but you need to highly consider living somewhere else for he moment. Ask to stay at a stable relatives or friend's home until you are on your feet. Offer to pay them a reasonable amount of rent.

Them stopping isn't going to fix it either. Dry drunks are shitty too. I really honestly think that you may be headed for a hard road if you don't find support and perhaps some counseling. I was in an unstable abusive home with my stepmom and I was angry for years. I don't think I was ever truly happy until I turned 40. Don't spend the next 21 years living a life that is full of anger and fear.

Yes, it does. Using physical force on your grown family members in that way is not normal. In fact everything you describe sounds very concerning.

Your feelings are a normal reaction to how you are being treated. Don't concern yourself with seeing things from his point of view too much - his point of view is unreasonable.

Either way, my parents have raised their voices to me but never insulted me as a person (They might say I behaved badly but not say I was bad. Important difference) nor been physically aggressive towards me outside of when I was too young to understand the reason I should behave. This is my normal. Your normal has been warped by being badly treated. Even people who love you can treat you badly if bad treatment becomes their normal. You deserve a better sense of normal treatment. You deserve respect. If you spend your life getting yelled at and thinking it's your fault you'll get used to it and it puts you at risk of accepting abusive behaviours in a relationship. The only reason a grown adult gets angry enough to scream and yell is their own inability to manage their anger response.

If your $300 friend is paying rent and on the lease, your ex-friend can just deal with it. They're sharing a house. *Sharing* being the operative word.

It's understandable that you feel like you can't trust this guy, and it's understandable that you would feel uncomfortable with them hanging out.

Subjects like this are pretty touchy in a relationship but I've learned that there is a pretty easy way to tell if you're being an ass or not. 

In a healthy relationship, you would have a discussion about this. You would talk to each other and you would tell her ""I don't feel comfortable having you two hang out, and I would rather you either not hang out with him or have me around when you do."" Or something along those lines. It would then be up to her whether or not she continues to see him, and if she decided to you would have to decide if that is a deal breaker for you.

My guess is that your girlfriend told you this she wanted you to know  for a reason, maybe she's reaching out to you because this guy is a fucking creep.  T  No ultimatums , no demands, if she wants an apology give her one.  Just tell her how you feel, and then REALLY LISTEN to what she says in response. Then try to move forward together from there. 

Then talk to him man. Tell him she told you what he said, and let him know you don't think it's appropriate. Let him know what your girlfriend though about the comment. Tell him that not respecting your relationship is the same as not respecting you and your girlfriend individually.  If you want an apology, tell him that, if you want an explanation ask for one. 

You're never going to be able to police your partners actions and have a healthy relationship. You need to trust them, and you build trust through open and honest communication.  That being said you're under no obligation to stay friends with this dude.
and if you've told her that her being around him makes you unhappy and uncomfortable and she's ignoring that, that's a problem in and of itself. 

",Human
4yt0vh,"I just wonder about HER mindset about the whole thing.  My best friend is a woman I've known since high school.  But a big part of that long-lasting friendship is that I've never had romantic or sexual inclinations toward her.  She's certainly an attractive woman, but she's always been more of a sister to me.  If I were to express sentiments like OP has reported, I'm sure she'd be freaked the fuck out",Human
4yt0vh,"One on one is a no no. Group interaction is perfectly fine and it will happen. But going over to a male's house to watch a movie or to drink is inappropriate behavior. I dont want the old ""we drank too much"" fiasco to even be a possibility. Now i certainly dont expect a woman to drop her lifelong best friend because we are now a couple. For instance, i probably wouldnt date you for long if i knew you have a male best friend or if you have many many male friends. Im jealous and that would bother me and i really dont want to mess with it. I am old fashioned. A man should not hang around solo with other women while in a relationship and vice versa. My relationship is solid and simple. I expect things from my wife and my wife expects things from me and it works great. ",Human
4yt0vh,"In general, I'd say it is unwise to hang out and drink alone with people of the opposite sex who have expressed interest in having sex with you. I know you can't live life without taking some risks, but unless part of you wants to have sex with that person, it's just not a smart situation to put yourself in.

Maybe asking her to cut ties, just like that, is not the best move... have spoken to her though about *why* you are concerned? If she sees it from your perspective and she values your relationship and fidelity to you, I would think that she would *want* to cut ties to this guy or at least step back on her time around him.

But maybe she has a perspective of her own that varies. Have you spoken to her about it to get her point of view?",Human
4yt0vh,"You only want her to stop hanging out with him because you're afraid she's going to have sex with him. Instead, you shouldn't be so insecure. If you even think she might be the type of person to cheat on you, why are you going out with her? Because you're insecure and you feel like you got a girl you don't deserve and you're hanging on for dear life because you don't want to lose her and be alone again. Gain some self confidence and look for a girl you trust.

In this situation, you're being an asshole. Also, it's not even effective to tell her not to do something, because it's just going to make her want to do it more.",Human
4yt0vh,"It takes more than him wanting to fuck her for them to fuck. I say you should just trust her and respect the friendship she's keeping since high school since it's definitely important to her. 

Two things may happen, they continue being friends as always or they actually do get together and she cheats on you. If it's the latter, they you're better off knowing she's a cheat as soon as possible so you can end the relationship and not waste your time. Prolonging your relationship with a person who would cheat on you by asking them not to go out is like curing a broken arm with a bandaid.",Human

4yt0vh,"I'd like to point out that if you were in a relationship, and you were hit on by a girl, and your girlfriend blamed you for it she would be the asshole.

Blaming people for the actions and thoughts of someone else is never okay. OPs girlfriend is allowed to hang out with whoever she wants, whenever she wants. The fact that the friend has said stupid shit doesn't make her the asshole, it makes the guy who said it an asshole, and OP a bit of an asshole for not being able to let his girlfriend make her own choices. The only way OPs girlfriend is an asshole here is if she sleeps with this friend, which is unlikely because he sounds like a creep.",Human

I've been reading the responses and something I've noticed is that, intentionally or not, you're asking people for solutions. This isn't a problem anyone but you and her can solve.

And when they complained, I just wouldn't go home because everything was in walking distance to my dorm anyway. There's a difference between being lazy and being afraid. I used to have back spasms because I held my back so rigid while driving that my muscles couldn't relax at all. I didn't get over my fear of driving until I was prescribed fluoxetine.

I am sure your father would lighten up a bit if he knew that you were at least trying. I sympathize. It's really not as scary as I thought it would be. It helps that I am in control of *my* car.

&gt;It's your choice not to drive, but that doesn't make it your dad's responsibility to get you where you need to go. 

I disagree. If his dad wants him to go to a school half an hour away instead of the public school nearby, then it should be his responsibility to get him there. If the dad doesn't want to chauffeur him around, then let him go the public school where he can use public transportation. 

I'm all for overcoming fears, but I'm more for dangerous drivers not being on the road. It sounds like his fear is more than just a 2 week driving course from being eliminated, so considering school is back in session in most of the US, I don't think this is an immediate enough option. The dad needs to suck it up and take him to school. ",Human

I'm not sure where you live but in the U.S. 17 is still considered a minor and and in the vast majority of families this means you still live by your parents' rules.

And if his dad doesn't want to drive him to private school and he feels like he'll get the education he needs, he'll allow it. But if that were the case, why would he have sent him to private school in the first place?

Your argument seems to be that he should either get over his fear of driving (we won't even go into the fact that it could be a much deeper problem that needs more than just ""getting over"") or switch schools, *ignoring the fact that his dad may not allow it.*

So, now knowing the possibility exists that his dad won't allow him to go to public school and that his driving fears might be a deeper issue than you apparently think it is, what would you propose he do? Walk 20 miles to and from school every day? I feel like this is common sense.

Your lack of grasp on reality and how families work is mind blowing.

Not really, in a lot of the US states, 16 is the legal age of consent. In Germany, 14 is the legal age. In France and Denmark, the age is 15. Where I live, you are considered a minor until you're 18, but the legal age of consent for sex is 16.

&gt; If she's sexy and you'd bang her, then you find out she's underage and you go, oh ew shes not sexy at all anymore, I'm not the weird one, you are.

This is the sentiment of a Predator. Fuck first, ask questions later. 

All these people talking about how age of consent laws below 18 make it  appropriate for them to want to fuck minors are omitting critical parts of the law as well as ignoring the spirit behind age of consent laws. 

Age of consent laws exist to prevent adults from engaging in sexual relationships with minors because it is believed, and scientifically supported, that minors do not have the psychological and emotional tools to enter into an equal sexual relationship with an adult. Therefore those relationships are intrinsically predatory. 

The law has absolutely nothing to do with physical development, because we as a society know that physically maturity does not mean emotional or mental maturity.  

So, when you hear an adult  saying"" who cares if she's 17 i'd still fuck her"" , which is exactly what the person you responded to did, they're saying they're okay victimizing someone because of their attractive to them and that's their only consideration.

Grow up and do your damn homework. Try. If you make an effort teachers don't do things like this. Teachers only do this to students that are on track to fail.

Regardless of whether or not you're an asshole in this case, the host has definitely been one.

While I think you make a good point that certain ""antisocial behaviors"" would definitely qualify as asshole-ish behavior as well, I think there's room in the colloquial usage of ""antisocial"" for behaviors such as ""not wanting the company of others"" that would not qualify as asshole-ish.

Last I checked, we're in /r/AmItheAsshole, not college. So I think it's okay to stray from academic literature a little bit and accept more common definitions for terms such as ""antisocial"" and ""asshole"".

If I may though give my thoughts on a couple points that caught my eye. In your efforts to help/please others you seem to have neglected yourself. You are just as important as anyone else. You have needs and desires to live a full life and you should absolutely take care of them, and feel good about it.

I feel it's important to always tell the truth, once you tell a lie it tarnishes things in strange ways that never seem to go away. I also feel like it's ok to tell the people you volunteer with what you want and feel. They should respect that. If you don't feel comfortable being honest with people that you donate your time to, I would wonder why. I hope you have a wonderful Sunday whatever you decide, sounds like you deserve it.",Human

5000pc,Thank you all for your input. It's nice to get some perspective once in a while.,Human
5000pc,"You are 100% the asshole here. 

 If you lent him money when he specifically stated he wasn't sure when he could pay you back then you don't have any right to police his spending habits in the interim. 

 Doubling down on it after you explicitly told him the money was no longer an issue is not only an asshole thing to do, but also really irrational. Did it cross your mind that he was spending more specifically because you told him his debt to you was gone?

If you're lending money to someone without an explicit agreement it should be because you trust them. By policing the other person's spending habits like you have you've essentially told this person that you no longer trust them which is tantamount to saying you're not friends.  Maybe you could have salvaged things after you let the debt go but now that you're demanding it again you're not only saying you don't trust him, but also demonstrating  he can't trust you.  It's going to be hard to come back from that. ",Human
5000pc,"That's the thing. I don't trust him. Not anymore. Since I lended him the money he stopped calling, coming by, hardly ever had time to hang out. Don't know why. All I know is, this friend of mine who I lent money stopped wanting to see me.  
  
So I acted on my observations since I only had my own point of view to go from. He wasn't about to tell me anything. Then when I finally managed to get a hold of him, he talked me out of claiming the loan by saying it still wasn't possible since money was tight. The expensive gaming PC was an installment payment and he never mentioned anything about the new phone (Which I later found out he had bought around the same time). We were friends, so of course I'd cut him some slack.  
  
It was the moment that he stopped acting like my friend and became a stranger that I've had to look out for myself. When he's gone AWOL and I find out that he's been... not exactly lying, but definitely been beating around the bush, why should I take it? Would it not make you feel violated? Does it count for nothing that my promise to erase the debt was made under false understandings?  
  
Thank you for serving it to me exactly how you see it. I appreciate the feedback.  
  
EDIT: I don't know if it counts for anything, but keep in mind that we're not talking pennies. The amount is almost exactly 3x my monthly income (I'm a student)... Thanks again.",Human
5000pc,"I get what you're saying, and overall you seem like a good guy.  

It's not unreasonable for you to have been expected to be paid back, but it is unreasonable for you to expect him to tell you everything he's buying in the interim. 

 It's not cool for him to blank you, but it's a bit of a jump to think it's malicious. People have a lot of shame around money and debt, so maybe its hard for him to be around you til he pays you back. Especially after you pressed him on it already.  It's very possible he was never trying to deceive you. 

I think you're assuming too much malicious intent and it's making you be the bad guy more than you need to be. I could be wrong, but that's what i'm getting with the info i have. 

My advice would be to have an honest and open conversation, not about the money, but about the series of events that put you against one another and how you feel about them.  Once you have it all in the open i'd decide from there. ",Human
5000pc,"Thank you. It really means a lot, even coming from a stranger on the internet. I see your point about being around people you owe money to. I haven't exactly been the most stable person these last couple of years and when I felt him distancing himself from me I guess I took it pretty hard. There are other factors in play so it makes sense that we can't always stay as close as we used to be.  
  
I've kept this to myself since its no ones business except me and Peter's. In my head I seem to have turned it into something its not. Judging from years of being friends, it doesn't even fit into his nature to act like I've interpreted it.  
  
Thanks again. I'm going to sleep on what you've said.",Human
5000pc,"in case you care, you *lend* people money and *borrow* money from people.",Human
5000pc,"Both assholes. He should have made it a priority to pay you back, whether or not you expected repayment. You should have been more clear with yourself and him about what you expected from him.

On a side note: Some people are just really bad at monetary management and see ""25 dollars in the bank"" as ""25 dollars left that I can spend this month"" - if that's not enough to pay you back, he might then be tempted to buy something new. It's irrational but pretty common. So while it's still a defect in him, you can imagine how he might be failing to pay you back and acquiring new things/debt while not needing to see him as malicious.",Human
5000pc,"Yep, you're an asshole here, maybe not the only asshole, but you're certainly one. Few things to keep in mind, 1. never lend money you can't afford to lose. 2. don't loan friends money, just give it to them. 3. if you do loan them much (which you shouldn't do) then set up a repayment plan when you loan the money. Take collateral even. Finally, and this goes for anything really. Do go back on your word. This is doubly true when you tell someone ""don't worry about XYZ"" and then renege and try to make them worry about it. 

Sounds like you learned an expensive lesson. Learn from it, better yourself because of it, and move on. ",Human
5000pc,"Yes to all three of your points.  I don't lend anyone more than I can afford to lose.  I have a nephew that occasionally borrows $10-$20 from me.  Sometimes he pays it back, sometimes he doesn't.   But he's a family member that I love dearly, so I just let it go.

OP said ""don't worry about it.""  Although I understand the reasoning, it seems like it almost wipes clean the debt, or at the very least implies a time extension.",Human
5000pc,"He makes around double the amount he owes me. I know, I've worked where he works.",Human
5000pc,"Don't lend friends money, it's so easy to ruin a friendship over it.",Human
5000pc,"If you lend a person money that you know is bad with money, you're an asshole for getting pissed when they blow it. You basically damaged the friendship by giving an unconditional loan and then acting entitled down the line. If you really didn't expect that money back you should just be happy that your friend is doing better and make a note to not give them any more money in the future.",Human
5000pc,"So in your post it seems like you're pissed because of his spending habits, which makes you look like the asshole. But this makes me think you're feeling like he took advantage of your friendship by only hanging out when he has something to gain, and then his spending habits reinforced this in your mind. These are two very different scenarios and if it's truly the latter, you should probably just cut your losses because he probably never saw you as much of a friend in the first place.",Human
502cdw,"No, you're not an asshole.

It's your decision if and how much you want to leave for a tip. At least you are not the type that just didnt tip at all for one mistake. Obviously,  what she had done wasn't to your satisfaction,  why would you feel inclined to give her more?

I waited tables for years and asking for an item you don't want as quickly as possible is a recipe for disaster, it's the exact opposite of how a restaurant works. It's one of those things people assume makes no difference or is somehow easier/more efficient when it's typically not. In the future, eat your food then order dessert.

So I should have tasted the freezer malt before I asked for another one? That seems silly, cause someone could have drank the freezer malt after I left if they wanted, but if I drank out of it with my straw...that's disgusting.

Because I'm black and there is a huge stigma around tipping in general, not to mention the stigma around black people (Canadians) and tipping.",Human
502cdw,"I feel you. It's a stigma here in the states as well.

I hate it honestly. I want to tip based off of service, but they are more than likely going to just dismiss it as, 'Oh, it's because they are a teen, their race, etc' you never really win. I have just ignored it and tip well and not tip well for those who deserve it.",Human
502cdw,"Nah I'm in the states, I heard that in the service industry they call black people Canadians to avoid, you know, saying ""black people"". It's a lot less racist to say ""Damn, another table of Canadians""

502cdw,"You're a giant asshole. Per your response to a question below, you don't even know the difference in taste between a ""freezer"" malt and a fresh made one.

If you hadn't seen her pull it out of the freezer, you wouldn't have known there was a difference. She owned up to the error and remade it to your satisfaction, and you still gypped her money. If you're not happy with the service you've received, you need to take that up with the manager and not pull from the waitress. I know it's easier to just reduce the tip, but she likely won't even make the connection and she's not getting paid much per hour outside of her tips anyway.

She set herself up for failure by agreeing to something she wasn't going to do. And you're wrong, I expected to wait from the second I ordered it, which is why I asked for it to be made upon request.

&gt;If you're not happy with the service you've received, you need to take that up with the manager and not pull from the waitress. I know it's easier to just reduce the tip, but she likely won't even make the connection and she's not getting paid much per hour outside of her tips anyway.

You're probably right that she didn't make the connection, after all, I told her THREE times that I wanted something a specific way, and then asked her what I was unclear about when she pulled out the ""freezer malt"", and all she said was ""You want me to remake it, I can if you want?"" so yep, don't doubt that. I wanted to spend my time eating the food, and waiting for the malt, not following up with managers on some bullshit that's pretty obvious that I already explained and re-explained. If she can't get it, she can't get it. Not my circus, not my monkeys. Also, she gets minimum wage here where I live, so she's doing fine. Also, let me ask you this, what would be an acceptable reason to lower the tip? If not for poor service? Should we be tipping the ""standard"" no matter what? Under no c",Human
502cdw,"I wouldn't say you're an asshole, but you sound like a bit of a dick. Next time just order it at the end. Then you get what you want when and how you want it. If you tell the server you want it ahead of time they're going to try to anticipate when you're going to actually want it and give it to you promptly, because that's customer service.

I understand that the best thing to do going forward will be to order the dessert at the end, but I'm still not completely clear about what the majority thinks *is* a good reason to lower the tip. Clearly the general idea is that specifically asking for something to be done a specific way, receiving assurance that that's possible and then having the server deliberately not honor that isn't enough, so what is? 

I didn't camp out in her section (I took my malt to go), I *did* tip her 10%, and she makes minimum wage here, not the paltry ~$2 some states try to pay servers. I think basically people think I'm an asshole for the request, but my actual question was am I an asshole for lowering the tip. ",Human
502cdw,"You're showing a lack of awareness of the pressures on someone in a service job to fulfil any requests the customers make unless it is really not possible.

In the end, you didn't get what you wanted even though you explicitly asked for it and she agreed it was doable.

 That being said, I've maybe tipped &lt;15% once.  I will only reduce the tip amount if the waiter/ress takes unreasonably long to reach the table (excused if place is busy) and/or has a bitchy attitude.  I recognize people make mistakes and don't want to penalize them for accidents.

502cdw,"Yes. 

You didn't even tell her you wanted it until after you signed your receipt. You shouldn't order anything after you get your bill imo. Order it whenever you're ready. Idk why you made things so difficult. I hate eating out with friends who make things difficult for the waitress. And they always complain about it afterwards.",Human
502cdw,"Yep, you're the kind of customer that I have to hear about every time my wife comes home from work. 

You've clearly never worked in a restaurant nor cared to learn about how servers do their jobs. You are not her only customer and the kitchen isn't cooking food only for you. She put the malt in the freezer so that you could have it on demand and so you wouldn't get upset. So now she has to work a bit harder at the next table so she can pay her rent because you tipped her less for trying to help you out.

It's unfortunate but servers rely on tips for their income. The flaw is that they have to tip out the bus boys and food runners and bartenders based off sales. When you tip low for something that really wasn't a big deal and that she was not at fault for, she is out of pocket. Yes, it's a ridiculous system but that how it's been for a long time. 

Why did you dislike the suggestion that she place a frozen dessert in a freezer until your highness is ready for it? Why don't you order it at the end when she asks ""any room for dessert?""

She also fixed the problem and had it remade for you. I'd say her service was above and beyond which is when tips are really deserved. I'd just like to say on behalf of hard working servers everywhere that you sir, are a total asshole.",Human

Long distance relationships just don't work, especially when you're younger

Once a cheater, always a cheater.

Never go out with the same person twice. You broke up once for a reason, and that reason most likely won't go away. 

Now, you might think you're the exception here, you're not. Learn from the experience, find a nice girl that lives locally that won't take you for granted.

I was told to at least push him away, to create some distance between us. Anyways, later that day, at night, I went to the hospital. Half of my face (my right side) was unrecognisable. I was told by the doctors that it would take months to fully heal. 


The doctors said that I should come back the next morning to maybe get a operation around my right ear. 
(I looked like shrek, the right side of my face was raised. It was huge). But the operation wasn't necessary. Thankfully.


But thank God, I recovered fast during the weekend, and was only left with a black eye, a bit of a broken teeth, (which, thank God, can't be seen). And a pain on my right jaw for a few weeks afterwards.

If she says she's too lazy or whatever, say ""Ok, well, you know where I am, I'll be here for a while. If not, I'll catch up with you later.""

50icau,You're not the asshole. People are supposed to joke about serious things. That's what joking is for.,Human
50icau,"I think you're kind of an asshole. Firstly for your ""only pussies get triggered"" remarks. Sure, some people use the word to talk about minor upsets as opposed to actual traumatic reactions like reliving a horrible experience but that doesn't mean the word triggered can no longer be used for that purpose.  
Some people say ""I'm so OCD""  when they talk about how they like their books in alphabetical order or something but that doesn't mean you can assume everyone saying they have OCD is taking the piss.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume it comes more from ignorance of bonefide PTSD than maliciousness. 

Secondly, (paraphrased) ""It's just a joke, people should stop taking it so seriously"". You can't tell other people how to think and feel, especially when the subject is something potentially serious. You can try and change their views about it but you would need to do so in a respectful way, rather than just joking about it in a way that provokes them and provides nothing to the discussion (posting memes).

You seem to be wilfully ignoring the other side of the 'debate' in order to justify joking about the whole thing and keep telling yourself that anyone who disagrees is an oversensitive pussy.

Brisa understands PTSD. Brisa is the person in this conversation with knowledge, facts, and compassion. Is she taking herself too seriously when the rest of you are joking? Maybe. Maybe all of you need to grow up. I'm assuming you're all around fifteen years old, and this is normal behavior that you'll all grow out of. All teenagers are assholes. Asshole is the default state of the teenager. If you're over 18, you need to speed up the growing up process. This whole conversation is completely saturated with immaturity.

When a war veteran hears a car make a loud sound and freaks out, that's because they have been *triggered* by a sound that is similar to a sound that would have meant ""I'm about to die"" when that veteran was overseas. The word is literally about a PTSD symptom. A person with PTSD has certain things that 'trigger' their symptoms. These things can be sounds, images, smells, a trigger is something that puts their mind back in a place where they are in danger when their body is in no danger at all.

Yes, there are silly tumblr kids out there who think everything will trigger them, but you're just as awful as those tumblr kids when you make fun of them. You're *all* trivializing the word and stripping it of it's meaning.

I think you might be having trouble seeing things from their point of view though. It seems like you are naming all these reasons why communication or friendship is difficult and then concluding that it's not worth trying.

I can see why the chef might be annoyed that you only acknowledge him when your'e ordering food and you don't pronounce his name right though. That probably make shim feel like you think you're above him, even if that's not true. He can't see into your mind to know you're introverted or whatever. He just sees a guy that makes work for him and isn't friendly.

My advice is - learn how to pronounce his name. This is very important! Second, when you arrive/leave you could just pop your head into the kitchen and say hello or ""have a good night"" or whatever. It would help if you got your coworker to help yo learn those phrase sin Spanish. Even a smile and a wave would go a long way to showing these guys that you see them as people, not just people who make you food when you want it, which is probably how they're feeling so far.

I understand that you don't intend to boss them around, but if you only talk to someone to essentially give then an order, it would definitely feel that way. Getting their name wrong probably adds to that.

As far as the guys name, his name is Pedro and I was just pronouncing it without rolling the r's and now I do. 

As far as smiling and waving and all that, I feel like if I started doing it now they would see right through it. I think the damage is already done, I don't think they want me to be nice to them anymore or vice verce. 
I did think of that though, just saying hi at first without asking for food and then ordering food later. I'm still just not the type of person who walks into a room and says hi to everybody and everybody smiles and waves at me.

Right now, you're the one who needs to adapt to a different culture. Did you have to change your ways to fit in at school? You have to do that to fit in at this job.

I really think you should try harder to connect with the people at your work.

5xaj90," I'm with your boyfriend. You're not the asshole, she is, and you should not respond to her at all, and possibly tell police if it continues. 

Additionally, it is totally reasonable to bring""back up"" when you are doing a transaction with someone you don't know,  and I'm sure the buyer knows it, but is trying to twist it to seem like you did something wrong. ",Human
5xaj90,"I'd say you're not the asshole. In the future you should probably disclose if extra parties are going to be there, but still not an asshole. I think she is, to be honest. I wonder how many times she's done this to other people and gotten away with it...",Human
5xaj90,"Thank you. I was thinking that if she does phone the police or try to sue me or something, I have proof of the messages and there are cameras in my building that could prove nothing aggressive went on and that she willingly gave me the money and took the items. My boyfriend is saying that she can have fun getting nowhere with this situation. ",Human
5xaj90,"She's trying to scam you. She's the asshole, ignore her, if she won't stop contact the cops. ",Human
5xaj90,Sounds like a type of scam to me. Probably the type to hope to scare you into giving them their money back. You say you have the emails and can retrieve the video tapes so you are fine if she does call the police (which I highly doubt she will). It's mostly a scare tactic to scam you but if she does call.... She is not as bright as I made her out to be. Also your response is fine on review page since I read reviews before buying and your response ( plus high appraise from other reviewers) would not deter me. :),Human
5xaj90,What were the Items? ,Human
5xaj90,"If you haven't, save all email interactions with here. You made need them if this escalates.",Human
5xaj90,"I am going to keep them, as she is continuing to send me a barrage of messages! ",Human
5xaj90,"I second this comment. This situation actually sounds like a person I know who does this sort of screaming and kicking to get money back when she really shouldn't have spent it in the first place.

Also, people bring a ""scary"" friend/brother/boyfriend/toaster/etc to business transactions with strangers. It's normal. We're told repeatedly (even if it's wrong) that we're in danger without backup. 

OP is not the asshole, their customer is.",Human
5xaj90,"A couple of decorative candle holders( one of them holds 6 candles and is about waist height), 3 medium sized glass ornaments, a decorative shelf , and a set of 3 Olympics small wine glasses. ",Human
5xaj90,"Lol damn, I was sure they were dildos or guns with how you were talking about them.  You're not the asshole. All those items have a single function and it would be immediately clear if they could fulfill that function or not. 

My guess is that the person probably came ready to offer you less than they had on the phone, but panicked when they saw someone else is there. Now she's trying to retroactively get her money back. 

Worst case scenario she calls the police and tells them you did something you didn't. If you're white it'll probably be a non-issue. If you're not white or just want to play it extra safe I would keep a record of all your interactions with her. Be sure to categorically deny any claims she makes in text conversations. Documentation is your friend. ",Human

I had made several other sales and got nothing but excellent reviews. I was polite to this woman, through and through just like with the other buyers I had for other items. 

In fact, most of the items she wanted , other people wanted as well but she had gotten to me first so that makes me even more sure that these items were fine. 

I have saved all of the messages she has sent and mine as well. 

I seriously regret selling to this woman and wish I had just sold all the items separately and for full price to the others who wanted them because what should have been a simple sale has gotten way out of line. ",Human

If this happened EXACTLY how you say it did why are you coming here for validation? How is it not completely obvious to you that she is mentally ill with that story?  What are you leaving out of this story? If this is true you're an asshole for even wanting vindication on someone so ridiculous. If there's something missing you're an asshole for leaving it out and misleading us here just to get rid of your butthurt.

Nothing has been left out, I have sold multiple other items and haven't had a single other complaint. She did not seem mentally ill during our entire conversation online, she was friendly and she seemed excited about the deal on the price of the items and the items themselves. I think the only things I have left out this post is the fact that her car was white and her physical appearance, which was fine. 

I am sorry that I have baffled or upset you enough that you had to make a comment like this, that wasn't my intention. I am coming here for validation because I feel like an asshole for apparently scaring this woman by bringing my boyfriend to help me carry all the items , I feel like an asshole for making this woman feel like she was ripped off.  I am coming here for validation because I feel like an asshole and was wanting more of an opinion about if I was the asshole in this situation. Is that not what this sub is for? If I am wrong about that, by all means, please let me know.

But, just in case, you might ask the building to save the camera footage as it can get written over eventually.  Lesson from the business world - if someone asks for a deal in the future, ask for a reasonable discount ($10 off), not half price.

The rest of the time, while she was looking at the items and I was making sure she was okay with them, which didn't take very long, he was holding open the door leading from the outside to the lobby because we were in the way of people walking in and out and he was just being nice holding the door for them. ",Human
5xaj90,"Well, I guess there's always at least one. There were actually several that I talked to through messages but didn't sell to because they ended up just asking absolutely ridiculous questions , sometimes of zero relation to the item, and then just not even wanting to buy it.

If not, then contact the site explaining what happened and request your feedback on her be updated or removed. Forward her abusive messages to them as well.",Human
5xaj90,"Meh, it's almost a given that *both* the buyer and seller won't be alone when making such exchanges. It's simply smarter to have another person as backup for anything going wrong. I don't see a need to disclose such a common scenario.

And if you're going to a person's house, you should expect good odds that they won't be alone. Partners, roommates, kids...",Human

&gt; You are right, I should have mentioned that he was likely to be coming down with me, I am deeply sorry about this

You have nothing to be sorry about (you are not the asshole), but when scammers see something like this it makes them think they can push you around. That may be why she turned up the heat and sent a flurry of messages - she smelled blood.

Your boyfriend's advice is good. It might help in the future to think of these things as business transactions rather than taking irrational feedback personally. You didn't misrepresent anything, you did nothing wrong, don't feel bad.",Human
5xaj90,Thank you very much ! This entire experience has made me more wary than before about selling things to people I don't know. At this point I'm quite nervous about selling things to people from sites like this because I don't want this situation happening again! ,Human
5xaj90,"I mean, I'd agree with you overall, but it's still polite to disclose it, in my opinion. I've always made it known I wouldn't be alone at my apartment and people have always let me know if it would be the same ",Human

5xaj90,Thanks so much! Hope you're right!,Human
5xaj90,"Can you add to you comments to the online review to include her threatening message, or at least refer to it?",Human
5xaj90,"Hell, the buyer was irresponsible for going alone, and I hope the police tell her that if she actually calls them.",Human
5xaj90,"Very sorry, am not 100% sure what you're asking for. Her review of me or her messages? Perhaps both? If it is the former:

She had left me a negative review and you have the power to delete reviews you don't want and I deleted the one from her ASAP as I am still trying to sell items and did not want that to have a significant negative impact. 

It didn't have an impact but the fact that I have now had about four people messaging me saying they were watching my items but have been informed by another user not to purchase from me, has negatively impacted my sales. I am wondering if she is going to all the users individually and informing them or if she has made some kind of post on the website that I am unable to find. 

If it is the latter you're looking for:
I am happy to provide some messages but as I haven't done anything like that before, and don't have access to a computer, just a phone , maybe this sounds stupid of me but I'll need to be advised on how I'm supposed to save the messages and block out names/identifying info. 
",Human
5xaj90,"I thought that you couldn't delete her negative review, so I was suggesting that in your published response you include her nasty emails. 

I does sound like she might be going to individuals and badmouthing you. Can you tell whomever moderates the site about what she is doing? With luck they might give her a warning or block her. ",Human
5xaj90,"Thank you! Late last night I actually was contacted by the person who moderates the site. They had already received a complaint from this person about me. I had simply just stopped responding to the messages that she continued to send me throughout the day and I guess the fact that she could see I read them and didn't respond pushed her over the edge and made her file a complaint. I would have blocked her but was unsure if blocking her would remove the messages I had from her. 

The message I received basically just said that she had reported me for misconduct and explained to them that I was very aggressive towards her and ripped her off. They said that it points out in the rules that it is ""buyer beware"".They told me that after taking a look at my reviews they can tell that I'm a positive seller but that they also know that bad reviews could have been deleted. They told me that if I'm reported again my access to this site would be revoked. 

I responded thanking them for taking the time to review her complaint and for not taking any further actions towards me at this time. I explained my side of the situation to them and assured them that I do everything in my power to ensure a smooth and easy transaction. I haven't heard anything back yet from them. ",Human
5xaj90,"You're no asshole ,infact if I was ever buying things off someone online , I love if the seller was someone like you.You seem really nice. She's probably just looking to scam you block it and if there are problems contact your local police station .
Also I'd expect you have someone else, even for back up. if I was a buyer I'd bring a family member / friend with me always for anything like that.
you are 100% in the right here for everything.",Human
5xaj90,"Thanks so much! It was upsetting to me that she acted out like this because I do everything I can to make sure I'm a good seller, but when people act like this I can't help but feel like an asshole!",Human

5xekzz,"No, doing the shit he was doing took the fun away from you.  He deserved to be fucked with and reset.",Human
5xekzz,"The reason I felt so bad though, was the fact that normally he wasn't this extreme with it, and like I said it was common for us to fuck with each other.

Also GTA Online had only been out for (I think) 2-3 weeks, so he didn't really get to play much before he was banned for a month and when he came back we were way ahead of him and we weren't as crazy as we used to be about the game. There were also other people in our group who cheated/glitched and were never reset (at least at the time I played).

I kinda feel like he ruined 1 day of fun for me so being petty I got him banned and ruined a months worth for him. I dunno that was my reasoning behind thinking I'm an asshole anyway.",Human

Apparently if he drives over your car with his tank it doesn't *technically* count as him destroying it so the game just decides ""You broke your car so you have to pay to get it back.""

That seems harsh but yeah, you know what I mean.

Edit: I definitely should have been more clear about this. Discussing a specific relationship issue in an anonymous place is one thing but when you complain about your SO to friends and they constantly hear the bad stuff, they get a wholly negative picture of the relationship. Asking advice from time to time is one thing but mostly, the issues need to be sorted out in the relationship via communication with each other.",Human

5xkju9,You both sound like arseholes. Who are you to tell him who he can and can't hang out with and who is he to say what he said to you?

5xkju9,"Not an asshole. This guy clearly isn't your Mister Forever, whatever else he might mean to you at the moment. So since you're having issues, and clearly fight often, perhaps its time to move on?

As to you however, I will say speaking about your fights to your friends is poor decision making. You need to work things out with your partner, not just complain about them. A little general venting is normal, but spilling details and exact quotes? That's a bit much. ",Human
5xkju9,"I'm going with both of you are assholes. There's airing dirty laundry and then there's asking friends for advice, and if you're not sure which you're doing take a good look at the kinds of things you say to friends about him. If it's mostly complaints about actions and words then you're definitely airing dirty laundry. It's actually something I'd avoid doing , I know there's a need to have your feelings validated but part of growing up is being confident in your own emotional reactions in a relationship. Plus things you say to friends and family about a SO stay with them, you can forgive bit they usually won't.  He's a little justified in thinking you're saying things to people (that sound like mutual friends but I get they were your friends first) that will make them dislike him. Though if that's the case at a certain point you've gotta ask yourself if this relationship is worth it.

Honestly the whole relationship sounds a bit toxic and immature, hence the ""both assholes"" comment. I'm sure many females have been given some variation of the ""you're overreacting"" spiel, but if it's every time you guys fight then he's an asshole. Controlling who sees who and when it's also a red flag (on both your parts).  
I dunno, though, because I'm not in this relationship. In general try to take the high road and avoid talking about everything that casts him in a negative light with friends, and try to keep super calm and rational when arguing so he can't pull that overreacting bullshit (",Human
5xkju9,You talk to your partner about the problems. Yours sounds abusive though.,Human
5xkju9,"""Out of respect for you, I'm not going to talk poorly of you to people who know you just because we're having a rough spot. I'd appreciate the same respect"" is the healthy version of the sentiment there, though.

Some people don't seek out the validation and advice of others for most issues, and some do, and if you're a sharer, and I'm not, it's going to feel like you've gone and outnumbered me on this, and potentially done a bit of side slander as well. From someone who generally feels the other way about this... Most people aren't doing this as a way to keep you trapped, they're doing it because they don't think anyone should be doing it, and when it turns out you disagree it's very disorienting and feels like ganging up. Which makes Silent Cal defensive, because who likes to feel ganged up on?

Just wanted to offer up another side, for consideration.

5xkju9,"All the stuff you list, *and* he's cheated on her in the past. There is no way he's worth putting up with this shit.",Human
5xmc2m,"Yes that was an asshole move, but he deserved it.  He wanted contact, he got contact.  Lots of people wanting Dick.

Well done.",Human
5xmc2m,"Yes, you should just block him instead of spitefully spamming him.",Human
5xmc2m,"Ehh, it's too much for r/prettyrevenge, but he obviously did something to make you not let it go. I would say it's kind of an asshole move...",Human
5xmc2m,Yes you are.  ,Human
5xmc2m,"You are totally an asshole. Yes this dude was annoying you and kept on messaging you while you stated you weren't interested. You should have blocked him and moved on. But dont get me wrong, what you did was hilarious and that dude is gonna learn a lesson about giving his number out to strangers, but you shouldn't have gotten that petty. ",Human
5xmc2m,"You're an asshole, but fuck me if you're not a funny asshole",Human
5xmc2m,"You are not the asshole. What you did is harmless. Very annoying, but harmless.

EDIT - okay, maybe a small asshole.",Human
5xmc2m,All these dudes getting their panties in a bunch... No.  You're not an asshole.  Dudes gotta learn somehow.  ,Human
5xmc2m,Not an asshole,Human
5xmc2m,"Is the process automated, or will real people be taking time out their work day to call the guy?  If it's real people, that has the potential to ruin several people's Monday if he starts being a dick to everyone that rings his phone.",Human
5xmc2m,You're an asshole who's actions are justified.  I would delete this thread in case he googles revenge car dealership calls.  Maybe I'm paranoid.,Human
5xmc2m,Kind of an asshole but I think it was justified. I wish we were friends. That was pretty clever.,Human
5xmc2m,"You are an asshole.

Like the other people said you are not only annoying him but also the people who have to call him.

Doing it with friends in a lesser extend is funny cause you will see thier reactions when you meet them again and can poke them a bit but doing it with a stranger seems like pointless revenge to me. Did it feel satisfying to not get the reaction? I doubt so. Wild guess: Could it be that you posted this here to hear that it was a funny move? Could it be that you want to get some reaction out of this? Why did you even proceed to text with him when he was such a wierdo to begin with? Constant bullshit and you couldnt stop texting him? Go to some anti aggression camp then. Not meant to be rude but ffs feeling spiteful about that? Id, at best, feel sorry for him.",Human
5xmc2m,"Honestly, she could have and moved on without much consequence.  But people who do this to one person tend to do it to several.  I would be inclined to say although it's an asshole thing to do, he probably deserved it and she racked up no karma by doing it.",Human
5xmc2m,"I don't feel bad for him at all.  Some people have no problem doing this shit to women.  Yea, she could have blocked him but does a woman really need to just roll her eyes and block number after number of assholes who just want nudes?  She admits she could have blocked him and moved on, but did it out of exasperation.  Once enough guys have done that shit, taking out a little petty revenge on one of them is just going to happen.  If he had moved on when she made it clear she didn't want to sext his number would have just gotten buried.  Funny how no one feels for the women who get dogged by assholes like this, they are just told to ""go to some anti-aggression camp"".",Human
5xmc2m,Eh it's a Monday anyway. But that guy is going to have to switch phones haha,Human
5xmc2m,"I feel like an asshole move cancels out another asshole move.

I guess by that logic, you're even.",Human
5xmc2m,"You're the asshole superhero women deserve, regardless of your gender.  Godspeed.",Human
5xmc2m,"Actual people answer. But working in the car business 9 times out of 10 people are assholes for no reason. So, when we call out, especially to truecar customers who don't realize their info is going to be sent to dealerships, because they don't read the disclaimer when they click the ""Get local pricing"" button, we go in ready for someone to be irritated. Most of the time, we just laugh it off, because the bigger the dick, the better story to tell our coworkers when we hang up. 

",Human
5xmc2m,"So, I went into work. He's already disconnected the number. ",Human
5xmc2m,"Considering I've done worse with a creep's number, I can't really call you an asshole",Human
5xmc2m,"Where did she talk about nudes? Did I miss that part? If yes I totally agree, if you just assume that well then stop assuming it

He cant annoy you if you block him though... yes it does make him a wierdo but hey that is  his problem not yours.

If something like that happens in real life, I very much feel for the person who has to endure it but on the internet like I said no need to get to the point of such strong feelings.

Also like you said she is punishing him for her being annoyed about so many creeps... he may be an asshole I give you that but she is too for relieving her anger on one of that creeps. Even if you want to punish you can still send him a rage text and block afterwards not some over the top shit.",Human
5xmc2m,"She didn't say he asked for nudes - I classified a guy who incessantly bothers a woman to sext with him along with all the guys who beg for nudes.  As far as I'm concerned they are on equal footing as far as being shitty little creeps.  If you don't think so, that's fine, but I do.  And I think that a guy who is totally comfortable responding to her disinterest in sexting as someone who does it to multiple women.  That isn't something a guy just wakes up one day and decides to do.  Yea, she could have just blocked him.  But I don't feel even the slightest bit bad that she didn't.  I'll even admit it was an asshole thing to do, and I still don't feel bad about it.  In fact, I think about it as punishing on behalf of herself and the other women he has likely done this to.
",Human
5xmc2m,Agree to disagree I find it very shitty to just assume him being a sexting hungry asshole instead of an everyday nice guy creep,Human
5xmc2m,"okay that's funny as hell, but yea your an asshole , should of blocked him first. that said . well done ",Human
5xmc2m,mischief made,Human
5xmc2m,"Dick move, you're an asshole.",Human
5xmc2m,I'm gonna say you were the asshole because every dealer within 50 miles is excessive. I think it's not being the asshole if you did it on a smaller scale because it would teach him a valuable lesson about unwanted contact.,Human
5xmc2m,"He definitely deserved it. I mean... I guess you're possibly an asshole (not really... I mean... no), but are you an asshole if it's justified?",Human
5xmc2m,"You are an asshole here because your actions will have nothing to do with anything this guy does in the future. 

You can claim to think that what you did will stop him from doing things in the future, but it won't. ",Human
5xmc2m,"You are an asshole. If you don't want him to text you, tell him so. If he continues, you block him. I do it all the time.",Human
5xtk0z,"I don't know if there's enough evidence for me to say one of you is definitely the asshole, but I can say that it didn't sound very healthy. I'd say a lot of it has to do with how you say what you say. I think you make some good points, but there is definitely a wrong way to say these things, which could make you the asshole. But if you say then the right way and she is reacting this poorly to them, I'd say she's trying to start fights for some reason or another. At the end of the day, I think it's something you need to talk about. It's not so much that she needs to do complaining as much as it seems like her communication habits are poor. If the communication doesn't improve or it improves and you still don't get along, I'd say it seems like you fundamentally don't agree on many things.",Human
5xtk0z,"I don't think there is a definite asshole here. Coming from someone who regrettably was on the other side of a situation like this in a previous relationship, it honestly sounds like she might not be as into you anymore and either doesn't want to believe it or doesn't know how to express it. Part of this may be caused or made worse by ineffective communication and willingness to compromise on both sides. 

She doesn't feel the ""spark"" anymore, so she starts an argument to draw some sort of emotional reaction from you. You may not react the way she wants because like you said, the source of the fight is abstract and it's hard to understand without understanding where she's coming from. This starts a cycle of arguments and annoyance from both of you. Not healthy. 

It seems the best solution is to sit down and calmly discuss where your relationship is going, if it's worth trying to work through it, and how you can better your communication. ",Human
5xtk0z,All this *and* they *both* sound super inflexible and resistant to change. ,Human
5xtk0z,She sounds like an idiot,Human
5xtk0z,"You and I are literally in the exact same position. We even react the same to the nagging.
When you figure it out, let me know.",Human
5xtk0z,"Congrats, you're over the puppy dog love phase.  If there's more good than bad left in the relationship, then consider counseling or just being more attentive of her needs.  Look up ""love languages"" to find out what makes her tick.  Just because you feel loved by all the time you spend together doesn't mean she does.",Human
5xtk0z,"This is not a healthy relationship, your languages of love sound a little too desperate and frankly your girlfriend sounds WAY too hung up on the appearances of things, flowers, being rich, being 'womanly', etc... back out while you can.",Human
5xtk0z,"Just reading that gave me sympathetic annoyance and I am not even dating her. You're not an asshole, just someone doing the math on when the work required to maintain a relationship stops being  worth what you're getting out of it. Completely normal and, I would argue, healthy.",Human
5xtk0z,"I agree with other commenters who state that there is no asshole here. 

As someone who's been the nag as well as the one who's been nagged to, I highly recommend talking to each other about this issue. The impression I get is that she feels insecure and may be a bit of a perfectionist/control-freak and you may be a bit inconsiderate in the way you formulate things.

 I agree with everyone else here and suggest you take the [love language test](https://m2mbatesville.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/lovelanguagetest.pdf) because it helps both of you to gain insight into the way you express your love/affection and sometimes, if someone uses a language that we're not familiar with or we don't have ourselves, we don't always see it when someone is showing us their love.

Dear OP, talk to her. In depth. Tell her how you feel. Tell her you want things to improve. Try to steer clear from any kind of blame-placing, that won't help anyone.

The best of luck and feel free to give us an update :)",Human
5xtk0z,She is shit testing you. You nesd /r/theredpill,Human
5xtk0z,Sounds like you two are just incompatible.  ,Human
5xtk0z,Get the fuck out of here with that misogynistic cancer,Human
5xtk0z,"She sounds immature and high maintenance. Not sure what your age is, but she sounds like she's early twenties. Sitting down with her to discuss things may help, but it also sounds like she's acting out just for attention. So it may just devolve into more complaining and not achieve much. But it's worth a shot. ",Human
5xxbht,"It sounds like you opened up to her after the fact about how her actions hurt you.  That is a good thing, and not asshole behavior.  I think being offended and questioning her devotion to your friendship is natural, and does not make you an asshole.

Two possibilities that pop to my mind are 1) she is nervous that you want some quick fuckbuddy sex and she didn't want that, but didn't know how to address it, or 2) she considers you mostly a casual friend at this point - if you see each other, fun, but if not NBD.  If 1), she handled it all wrong, but perhaps deserves a second chance.  If 2), you are more invested in the relationship than she is.  It's natural to feel hurt by that.  As long as you're not mean, you're not the asshole.",Human
5xxbht,"No assholes here.  
She is not ""not a true friend"" but she's not as close to you as you seem to have presumed. You being offended seems to be quite one-sided assumption on how close you two are. She might find it weird to be hanging out with someone who for the past year and a half she's only talked with online. If you are a true friend, you would respect her boundaries.  
Of course, this is based on the little information about your normal interactions that your post gave. I don't think you're an asshole for getting offended but she doesn't seem like an asshole either just because she didn't put you as much of a priority as you did her.",Human
5xxbht,"nobody has asked this before, but maybe she still has more romantic feelings for you and therefore avoided to see you in person again ?",Human
5xxbht,Not the asshole.  Her excuses were stupid and transparent.  She could have just said no.,Human
5xxbht,"I don't think it's fair to put qualifications on what makes her a ""true friend"" in this sense, but I would absolutely be offended at her actions. I would definitely confront her about it. She's the asshole for making plans and then flaking out with the lamest excuses of all time. ""Too bored to go out""? What does that even mean? Spineless asshole for sure, IMO.",Human
5xxbht,"She did things like this constantly both before and when we were dating, which is why I broke up with her. I never understood the psychology behind it.",Human
5xxbht,"I think it's a possibility. She recently broke up with her ex-boyfriend. But I don't think that excuses her saying ""yes let's meet"" and then making these shitty excuses and cancelling plans--especially when she has a history of doing this (I broke up with her because of this).",Human
5xxbht,"Sounds like more of a case of ""she's just not that into you.""  However, that kind of behavior can also have psychological causes, such as social anxiety or depression.  If there are psychological causes for social avoidance, I'd be more forgiving.  Certainly, we on reddit cannot diagnose her, but I thought I'd toss the idea out there since you mentioned psychology.",Human
5xxbht,"With that info, I don't think she was ever a true friend.",Human
5xxbht,"Too bored to go out? Is that even a thing? Clearly she doesn't value your friendship the same way you value hers. In some ways, she did you a favor by making that abundantly clear.  Not an asshole!",Human
5y57h9,"Weed does still slow your reaction time, which really fucking matters when driving. I'm all for legalization, but against driving impaired. 

Next time don't continue to drive with him though, call a cab, call a friend. You don't have to condone the behaviour, but expect him to throw a great snit fit over it. 

For the record, he's the asshole. Anyone risking anyone else with a two ton vehicle is an asshole. ",Human

5y57h9,"You're definitely not the asshole, and are absolutely right for being concerned.  But, if he's an everyday toker and has only smoked a little, or it's been more than an hour, the effects will be pretty minimal.

As /u/The_Foe_Hammer said, weed will slow your reaction time, but it really effects and slows the cognitive part of thought, rather than the reflexive responses (which alcohol does a real number on).

My advice, just offer to drive if it makes you uncomfortable.  And if he doesn't let you, DTMFA.",Human
5y57h9,"Dtfma? And thank you, I really appreciate your response ",Human
5y57h9,"Wether or not you are the asshole sort of depends on exactly how the conversation went.  Most people don't like being lectured to, regardless of if the lecturer is correct or not.  There is lecturing a person like you are their parent and then there is talking to your partner as an equal and letting them know you are concerned.

Aside from that, if your boyfriend is actually high (not just ""I smoked a bit an hour ago""), looks high, and smells like pot, then he is dumb for driving.  ""I won't get pulled over"" are the famous last words.  It's true until it isn't and if he does get pulled over and the officer suspects anything then his life can be seriously negatively effected.  Like loosing his license, paying large fines, going to jail, unable to get certain jobs in the future kind of effected.  I enjoy smoking, but choosing to drive high and exposing yourself to that unnecessary risk is a sign of immaturity and a lack of self control.",Human
5y57h9,"I second this. If he smokes regularly and didn't have more than enough to feel a buzz, driving (though still not recommended) wouldn't be impaired really. Just like driving after one shot isn't realllllly going to affect your driving, but it's still not ideal to do. ",Human

So for all comparing alcohol to weed must have never built a tolerance for it. Alcohol has PROVED over and over it kills people, especially DRUNK DRIVERS. Someone show me the reports of accidents involving a driver who was ""high"" of marijuana. Like I said before if you don't trust your boyfriend leave him or drive. She has a choice and if he's doing drugs while driving and she's chooses to go that's on her but don't compare alcohol to weed when people can OD on alcohol. You can get super high and not be able to do anything but usually once you have smoked every day, the high becomes like a nicotine high from a user who smoked long.

Too lazy oh well leave him. Have no car? Oh well work for one until you do and you drive until then you can uber/Lyft ask for rides from others. If he can and you press him for 30 minutes he's still gonna do it. Another problem either leave him or convince him to stop. According to your replies it sounds like you're one sided and want a reason to find so he won't smoke before driving.

5y57h9,"To be honest, i've driven while, after and before smoking a J. I've gotten pulled over while totally stoned and I just got a warning that one of my tail lights weren't working. 

While I might get downvoted for saying this, I personally never had any issues smoking weed and driving. I do not drink and drive though, as drinking and smoking have completely different effects on me. Nor have I ever been labeled ""an asshole"" for smoking and driving. This is probably due to me not changing when i'm high or not. If I just smoked, the only way you'de know is if I tell you I did. 

So, to me it really depends on the person and how weed personally affects you. Besides that, I feel like I drive better when i'm high. I don't speed as often as when i'm sober. Now i'm not good with numbers, but I would assume the difference in driving style while high has more of an affect on safety than being sober and driving like formula 1.

5yco30,"I don't really see any assholes here. Relationships require communication and compromise. If this is something you can live with then leave it at that. If you can't, work these issues out.

When you're in a relationship, it's normal to get annoyed from time to time but a lot depends on how annoyed you get and how you act when it happens.",Human
5yco30,"You're biting your tongue, so not the asshole.  But you're also building up resentment, so likely undermining the healthiness of your relationship.  It sounds like your developing a habit that is perilous to relationships: keeping score.

It's completely legitimate to recognize that your partner is using a lop-sided approach to life's little irritations.  It's also legitimate to want things to be fair and balanced.  I think you're essentially saying, ""Quit getting on me for all the tiny things I do that irritate you; after all, you do plenty of things that irritate me.""  The underlying feelings are fair, but the approach is unlikely to ever be successful because it feels like tit-for-tat.

Instead, try bringing it up when out of the blue, and in a fair and balanced way. ""You know, I've been thinking about how we sometimes let tiny things that should be just little irritations turn into bigger things.  I think that's something that we can fix with a little effort.  I have some bad habits that irritate you, and you have some bad habits that irritate me.  Maybe, we could try to work on just a couple of those, ...like pick two habits each that we try to break.  What do you think?  I could work on turning the lights off as I leave the room and putting down the toilet seat, if you could work on hanging up your jacket when you come in and throwing your hair away in the bathroom.""",Human

Relationships are hard work, but they aren't supposed to be full of dread.

5yco30,"Ok, you're not an asshole, but you could use some help. Do you know for sure that if you corrected her small mistakes that she would go apeshit? Does she say hurtful things to you, is she never wrong, and nothing ever her fault? 

Relationships shouldn't have petty shit, unless you're in high school or something as there is no reason for it, but it happens a lot. Many times it is a sign of emotional abuse, but sometimes it's just narcissism.

5yco30,"Appreciate the feed back... I'll give some more info though. I'm not in high school this is not my first serious or long term relationship... AITA for venting to the internet about my relationship problems? I have been in bad relationships before and couples that communicate well are ""fairy tale like"" in that they are few and far between. I have a hard time telling her what bothers me because it upsets her so much which then turns into a slow downward spiral... and I hate seeing her upset. It's less fear and more just conflict avoidance...",Human
5yco30,"I look at biting his tongue as biting back confrontational or incendiary remarks while pissed off.  I'm absolutely advocating that he communicate, and suggested verbiage in my 3rd paragraph, but indulging in petty sniping is not communication.  He gets credit for biting his tongue.",Human
5yco30,"I know where you're coming from.  When you're cohabitating with another person in a generally clean and suitably maintained home there are always little liberties each party takes for the sake of convenience (or forgetfulness) that irk the other party.  When this happens you have the choice of simply accepting an imperfect environment or nagging your partner until they confirm to your whims.  I have always found it selfish to try to make the other person conform to your taste beyond a reasonable hygienic minimum, so I tolerate the inconvenience and let my partner relax.  Every partner I have ever had has considered it her inalienable right to pick every nit she can imagine some offense in and my duty to conform to her standard of order.  (I tend to fall into the leaving glasses out/not hanging a jacket camp, not the light wasting/bathroom destroying camp.)   

In 40 years, I have never succeeded in convincing any woman to see any value in the fact that I do not nag them every time they leave a wet towel where I don't want one, or clog a drain with hair.  I have always assumed this would be the first step to convincing them treating me the way I'd like to be treated, rather than just addressing me as an annoyance that must be altered until tolerable, but can't say from experience that it ever works out that way.

5ynjbp,No. Your MIL seems pretty abrasive and callous. I do think it would be a good idea to talk this over with your wife if you haven't already. She might not want to see her mom kicked out. ,Human

5ynjbp,Yes she is...it's a tough situation for me.,Human
5ynjbp,"Oh I'm aware, she brings the dog everywhere. She has another daughter who lives with her who could have watched the dog....",Human

Maybe you can all agree on a date for mom to leave and you can ~~drink~~ cope until then.",Human
5ynjbp,"She seems torn about it. All I want to do is vacuum like crazy right now, and I agree its the lesser of two evils and its a time for us to heal. I'd rather not get  frustrated every time she does something I deem inappropriate.",Human
5ynjbp,She gives her SOME comfort. But most of it is her giving an opinion that's completely irrelevant and inconsiderate. ,Human
5ynjbp,I dont know if I should right now...I dont want to get angry again. But I will definitely look it up ,Human
5ynjbp,Was it the first time you noticed?,Human
5ynjbp,Noticed the flea bites on her leg? Yes she was the only that slept with the dog last night.,Human
5ynjbp,My thoughts exactly. I've seen her use that stuff at her house but she's not consistent and you have to be when it comes to fleas. We actually think we might ask her to take off tomorrow.,Human
5ynjbp,Ohh ok. I thought it was like a long time thing you've just never brought up,Human
5ynjbp,No no she showed me at the hospital.,Human

5ynjbp,No. Fuck her and her dog. ,Human
5ynjbp,"Just FYI, as someone who has survived fleas. The DOG has to be treated by a vet. When they give the flea medicine the fleas jump onto the dog and die from the poison. Treating the house is a good idea but the treatment of the dog is really what helps the most.

5ynjbp,"The whole situation is really tough for you.

I've done similar things with laundry after months and months of discussions, the person saying they'll set reminders on their phone, stuff like that.

That seems extreme as far as pet peeves go.

If everything else is as good as you claim and it s just this, and you're toying with eviction over this... Yeah, that makes you the asshole.

Have you tried just leaving out one set of everything (forks, knives, etc) per person? That way he HAS to clean his dishes in order to eat? Maybe pick up one set of purple and blue sets and that way you know whose is whose. That way he has no choice BUT to clean his dishes if he wants to eat. ",Human
5yx62l,You're both assholes but you are a slightly bigger asshole. Tell him to hire a cleaning service to regularly come over and do his dishes if he doesn't want to do them himself.

You are also an asshole for reporting your ""best friend"" instead of talking to him about it. From the way you tell the story it sounds like he's more of an acquaintance than a friend. That of course if subject to how I interpreted your story so that is subjective of course. 

Next time you should talk about it and let him know your feeling on the matter and try to work it out. I would imagine that by reporting him the two of you won't be getting any type of deposit back(if you paid one) or at least the two of you will have to pay a few. I'll also add that his family are even bigger assholes. ",Human

He just didn't listen to me

5z10fu,And he really shouldn't get another dog. Just because someone thinks they're ready to take more responsibilities in life doesn't mean that they are ready for more responsibilities. There's nothing wrong with advising a friend that they may be biting off more than they can chew.,Human
5z10fu,"He's the asshole. You know what assholes do? Make decisions and make other deal with the consequences. You should call a bearded dragon rescue and see what they think and a dog rescue.

5z10fu,"You're right, I probably shouldn't have gotten involved",Human
5z10fu,Sounds like you stuck your nose where it didn't belong. If you had already moved out then it was not your responsibility to tell the landlords but his housemates.

5z10fu,"I can understand why it seems that way, but it wasn't like that for me. Yes, I was annoyed, but I wasn't doing it just to be petty. ",Human
5z10fu,Why the fuck should he have to move out? ,Human
5z10fu,He mentioned in another comment that he no longer lived with the guy when it happened. Get your context straight before commenting. ,Human
5z10fu,I don't know whether your an asshole here based on the information you have given but I don't think it was your place to rat on him and tell his room mates.  You are not living there and that is between them.  It is your job to support your best friend.,Human
5z10fu,"People are downvoting, but I agree. Even when it's clear the person isn't ready for a dog, it's still their decision. You and I have as much say in someone getting a dog as we do in them getting a pizza.",Human

5z10fu,No shit.  I'm surprised OP's friend hasn't decided to get violent with OP. Sounds like the sort of thing that would get you a serious ass kicking.,Human
5z10fu,His roommates would have figured out pretty quickly there was another dog in the house. Not an asshole. ,Human
5z10fu,Tbh I feel like the moms an asshole for putting that all on you. ,Human
5z10fu,I can't help but think about what could have happened to that dog had you NOT gotten involved. Dogs don't exist just to make a college freshman (who has no business owning an animal) feel better. If he's so emotionally unstable and couldn't care for reptiles how on earth would he properly care for a puppy? Fuck that. Good for you for getting involved.,Human
5z10fu,"The situation would have played out exactly the same, was my point. The roommates would find out, get mad, then tell the landlord.",Human
5z10fu,"I see that, but the way I thought about it is this...
Not that it's at all comparable, but I remember being told in high school psych about a woman who was being murdered outside in the street while dozens of people listened from inside their homes. They just all assumed someone else would call 911 but nobody did. Not saying that murder = dog owning against a lease AT ALL, but since I learned that, I've always been the one to step up when I feel that something is wrong for another person (or dog) with no shame about it. 
Similarly, a lot of times I listen to my peers complain about things they don't think are right in a job or something, where someone does something against the rules. And when they're offered advice about how to make a difference they just don't do it. I'm definitely not that person anymore, I'd rather bring it to someone's attention than sit and complain and worry about it. Just my two cents/ some food for thought! ",Human
5z10fu,"how about reaching out to the OP for the snowflake's contact info and inform him that **having** a child ~~is~~ has far more capacity at fulfilling him over a dog. a constant stream of warm pepperoni pizzas are quite comforting too.

5z3kke,"Don't be so judgmental, the purpose of Snapchat is for pointless ""what am I up to"" stuff like this",Human
5z3kke,"Well I wouldn't call you an asshole , If I were on your friendslist I'd call you annoying ,don't want to see things like that. it's just not interesting, it's either show me something interesting or something funny. Also atleast to me , its weird that you have your mom as a snapchat friend.",Human
5z3kke,"So Snapchat is basically for assholes, then. ",Human
5z3kke,"You jest, but I've been watching every one of those Planet Earth 2 things on there.",Human
5z3kke,No. Snapchat is for people who want to share easily what they're doing with their friends. ,Human
5z3kke,"I don't think anyone is the asshole. She expressed that she doesn't want to see you drunk so simply don't send her snaps of you drunk anymore. Its not an overreaction imo, shes just stating her feelings, not punishing you in anyway. ",Human
5z3kke,"If ""what they're doing"" is mundane shit like eating dinner, then the two sets are interchangeable. ",Human
5z3kke,"Don't want to see that?  
a) Don't use Snapchat;  
b) Ignore that stuff.",Human
5z3kke,"Not being part of the target market (i.e. ""assholes""), I opt for ""a"". Doesn't change the fact that thinking other people actually give a damn that you're eating a taco or cleaning your ears demonstrates a level of self-worship that's firmly within the borders of Assholeistan.",Human
5z3kke,"Someone might be interested. Different strokes for different folks. And, as I've mentioned, if you don't give a damn, you can just ignore it. ",Human
5z3kke,"No more than saying that people who spit on the sidewalk, smoke in breezeways, or piss on the floor are simply ""liking things I don't like.""  

",Human
5z3kke,"Asshole no, stupid yes. Take mom and dad off Snapchat.",Human
5z3kke,well my dad doesnt really care LOL. ,Human
5z3kke,Oh so true. ,Human
5z3kke,She did ask me politely not to do it but she said it in an assholeish way. ,Human
5z3kke,"Venue has nothing to do with it - some people like doing things that makes them assholes, and people who aren't assholes don't like them. It's the converse of what you suggested I was saying.   ",Human
5z3kke,"The word is ""converse"", not ""conserve"". 

The converse of ""If p, Then q"" (""If they don't like to do what I like to do, then they are assholes"") is ""If q, Then p"" (""If they are are assholes, I don't like what they do""). 

The fact that you don't undserstand that tells me that it wasn't simply an honest mistake on your part, you were just trying the usual weak dismissal tactic and are unwilling, even if able, to grasp the point. ",Human
5z3kke,"&gt; You're right, I meant to write converse... which is still wrong. Conversely is correct, but you can't just drop the ""ly"" and have it work. 

[Yes, you can.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_\(logic\))",Human
5z3kke,Did you specifically send it to your friends list or just post it?,Human
5z3kke,the first one ,Human
5z626c,"This is ""am i the asshole"", not ""am i an idiot""",Human
5z626c,What are you doing?  Stop it.,Human
5z9uig,Well this is just my opinion but it's not that little girls fault your brother is the way he is. She is completely innocent in this and I think you might be projecting your anger for him onto her. You are the asshole in this situation because you think that your brothers daughter should be responsible for your brother's actions. ,Human
5z9uig,"Yes, you are being an asshole. It's his money. He can do with it what he wants. ~~Frankly, you sound like an entitled jerk.~~ *Omitting this part because it wasn't fair to OP* This man, a man that isn't biologically related to you, is giving you $200,000 but is giving his biological son NOTHING. He's giving the money to his granddaughter, an innocent victim in the situation. And he's not even giving her the same amount he's giving you and your halfsister. ",Human
5z9uig,"I have no anger towards her, I just feel that she is no different from any other random girl. My father has met her once, and had no other contact with her. I don't know if I made this clear, but my issue is that he is leaving money for her, while he doesn't know her, solely because she is his biological granddaughter, while simultaneously telling me that sharing blood doesn't matter. So the fact is that he does care about blood, as he cares for her, even though he has never known her at all. As his non-biological son, this is painful to me as I do not share his blood.",Human
5z9uig,"Let me tell you a story. My biological mother is a total piece of shit. She's selfish and cruel and entitled and mean. Her grandparents were/are VERY rich. I'm talking, they have servants and valets, type of rich.

Biomom acted like a shit and the grandparents cut her out. All the other grandchildren that are in good graces with them have a considerable amount of cash coming to them. Not me. I didn't do anything to deserve being written out. It's not fair to me that my parent acted like an ass and I'm losing out on a lot of money.",Human
5z9uig,"Okay, that's an awful situation and I'm sorry for that. Did you have a relationship with those grandparents?",Human
5z9uig,You're the asshole. Your father can do what he wants with his money and it seems obvious that he wants his grand daughter to know that he cares even though your brother won't let him see her. It sounds too me like your father is being very generous and I feel that we are not getting the whole story. ,Human
5z9uig,What else do you want to get? That's the complete story. ,Human
5z9uig,"Not really. Unfortunately the shit she pulled was enough to cut her off for life. (TLDR she accused multiple men of raping her.) And because of that, I don't have any sort of relationship with an entire branch of my family. ",Human
5z9uig,"Well, as a general rule, when someone tells you they are leaving you $200k, the reaction should be to say thank you.  Arguing about how you should get more at the expense of another heir (his grand daughter, no less) is not only profoundly ungrateful, it's also disrespectful.  I'm sorry you're insecure about the circumstances of your birth, but that's your problem and you need to come to terms with it.  Him telling you that your lack of biological connection doesn't change his feelings for you doesn't mean that his biological connection to his grand daughter isn't also important to him.  You should take some time to reflect on your feelings about your father and put some serious thought into why you feel that he needs prove his love for you by excluding other people from his will.  So, short answer, yes, your behavior makes you look like an asshole.",Human
5z9uig,"Then why are you so upset? I think that rather than be upset that your father is giving your niece money you should be proud that he is generous enough to give money to your niece. I understand why you may be upset, but there is no grey area here, you're the asshole.",Human
5z9uig,"And you have the nerve to call me entitled? You believe your entitled to money from someone you barely know? Let me be clear here, my niece met my father once as a baby, she is 9 now, she does not know anything about him and is forbidden to see him, she is not his granddaughter besides in blood. The money is not an issue for me, I'd rather him give the money to charity, my issue is with my father caring about his biological relation to someone, while telling me it doesn't matter, no one is even responding to that part of it.
",Human
5z9uig,"I am upset because while he raised me from a baby, he is not my blood father, he has always told me blood doesn't matter, but when he is leaving a substantial amount of money to someone he doesn't know because of a blood relation, that makes me second guess our relationship, as he clearly values blood. The money is a non-issue, I do not care about the 200k going to me, or the 100k going to her, the money is simply what made me realize that he values blood relation.",Human
5z9uig,"Let me be clear, I don't give a shit about the money. I'm upset that I don't have that part of my family. I didn't even know about the money until a year ago but I've known she's been estranged for 20+ years. ",Human
5z9uig,"That is not my point at all, and I think I made that clear",Human
5z9uig,"Well, I'm pretty pissed about not knowing my brother or my niece, which is probably what I'm actually angry about",Human
5z9uig,"Just because he values blood relation doesn't mean he values you any less dude. Unconditional love is a pretty great thing, it doesn't really have a limit, there is always room for more. I think you should talk to your dad about this if you haven't because it sounds like there may be other underlying issues at play here. ",Human
5z9uig,"That's fair then. If that's the case, make a relationship with them, if that's what you want. I wish I could. 

And I shouldn't have insulted you. That was uncalled for. I'm sorry. ",Human
5z9uig,"Yeah, you're probably right, it's pretty hard to communicate with him over a 50 year culture barrier, pretty much why I asked this question. ",Human
5z9uig,"Yeah, Reddit can help a bit, but really you gotta figure out your own problems because you know them best. Good luck ",Human
5z9uig,"Thats okay, I didn't need to redirect the insult back, that was unnecessary, and I can't, brother wants nothing to do with me and has hated me since I was a child, the only time I ever spoke to him was when I was 8 when my father still talked to him every few months, apparently he told my dad he didn't want to speak to me but he gave me the phone anyone and my brother immediately hung up. I probably do harbor some resentment for my niece, but that is unintentional.",Human
5z9uig,"Thanks, I think I knew most of this stuff, but I helps to see it from other people",Human
5z9uig,I understand to you that's like some random girl but to him she is and will always be his granddaughter. Try to look at things from his side. I understand your feelings are hurt but when you have children it doesn't matter what they do or how far they stray they are still your child.,Human
5z9uig,Glad we could help 👍🏻,Human
5z9uig,"I think being resentful is a bit normal in this situation. And if you feel a bit sad about not having a relationship with your brother and niece, I'm sure your father feels the same way but magnified because it's his son and granddaughter. He probably feels weak but that he can give part of his legacy on to the granddaughter and help her regardless of what his son wants/says.",Human
5z9uig,"Yes, i know, that's actually part of it. I don't care he's my brother, but I care that he has clearly negatively  emotionally affected my father, which makes me extremely angry towards him. And yeah, you're right about the legacy part, I think I'm cool with him giving her the money now, as in I'm definitely not taking it as personal as I was. Thanks a lot for the help",Human
5z9uig,"I am going to separate myself from the asshole-judging for this one (because I have nothing but the desire to call you a lot of mean names) and instead try to connect to you on a human level and address the pain you're feeling.

Firstly, you are your father's son.  Biology doesn't matter a fig in this instance.  He made the decision together with your mother to create you with the help of a sperm donor.  He then raised you.  He has been your father your whole life, reassuring you throughout that time that your origin story in no way detracts from his love for you and his recognition of you as his son.  He is now ensuring for your continued wellness by leaving money for you after his death (which he is under no obligation to do for any of his children).  He loves you.  He values you.  His actions have spoken over your entire lifetime louder than any words, but he even gave you the words because you seem to need to hear them.

Let's move on to his other son.  Your half-brother is his son.  He raised him and has a history with him.  He loves him.  Parents who are capable of love don't stop loving their children.  They are estranged, and it is very likely that your father has regrets about both the estrangement and about actions he took or didn't take in the course of his relationship with your brother.  Until you have children, you may not be capable of understanding this, but even if your father hates his other son, he still loves him.  Two points of divergence from this though",Human
5z9uig,"Also since he only ever got to meet her once (not for the lack of trying I assume) this may be his way of letting her know that he does care for her even if the chance to have any sort of relationship was taken away from them. 

OP acts like an entitled brat imo. Maybe I'd understand his anger more if she was getting 200k and he only 100k but as it stands he is the asshole here.",Human
5z9uig,"You are an asshole and I have nothing nice to say to you about it. You are probably one of the most clear cases, and possibly the worst I've seen on this sub. So, kudos on that accomplishment. ",Human
5z9uig,"It's possible to wholeheartedly love a non - biological child AND also love a biological child he doesn't know. It's not a one or the other. It's pretty natural to take care of family, blood AND otherwise. 
Just saying, this guy clearly doesn't care about biology in terms of you being his son, but he's allowed to look after his granddaughter too, she's his family whether you can see that or not, and she has done nothing wrong to deserve your dismissal. ",Human
5z9uig,"Your father has the means to improve the life of this girl and is doing so. Whatever his reasons, he sounds like a good man. You sound like a petty asshole.",Human
5z9uig,"Yeah it's clear as day he's an asshole and he doesn't see it. This isn't your money OP. If he chose to have all of his money sent into space (if he can afford it and found a way to do it) he has every right to do that. And you have no say in that. Doesn't matter about family relationships or the past. What he chooses to do with his money is between him and himself. You can feel mad about his choices, that's a natural reaction. But to act on it makes you an asshole. Get over it OP you're getting a 6 figure inheritance. ",Human
5z9uig,"Total asshole. If I ever try to bitch out someone who plans to give me 200k I want someone to slap me. 

He's a very generous fellow who wants to ensure his family is provided for. You're an asshole for trying to tell him what to do with his money WHILE HE'S GIVING IT TO YOU. 

You don't get to tell him how he ought to feel about anybody. I'd go apologize if I was you. 

On a side note, if your niece is under age your dad might want to look into ensuring your brother can't take any of that money on your nieces behalf. ",Human
5z9uig,"Wow have not seen such a blatantly obvious case in a while.  

Yes.  Yes you are 100%.  Not your money.  It's your father's.  He isn't giving your brother any money which would show he respects you.  His granddaughter is innocent of wrong doing and shouldn't be punished for her father's actions.  I'm saying this without even knowing if he had a legitimate reason for going no contact.

She is not getting the same amount.  She is getting half another way your father is showing that you are more important.

Your father should not have to deal with your opinion in the deciding of his will at his age and I think he did a fantastic job to show everyone how he cares.

Your opinion matters when it's your will not anyone else's.  ",Human
5z9uig,"Yes, you are being a major fucking asshole.  It is his money to do with as he pleases.  Just be happy that he's leaving you something.  This is his last goodbye to a granddaughter he was estranged from, but I guarantee never stopped loving.  I am only surprised that you get more than she did, blood or no.  
",Human
5z9uig,"Not only does he not see it, he's arguing with every well-thought-out response trying to help him, and being a total asshole to strangers just because they have different opinions.  Not just an asshole in this specific instance they asked about, but seems like an asshole just in general, if their reddit-behavior is any reflection on them IRL.

... Although even as I type that I realize that probably .0001% of Reddit users are anything like their behavior on this site, so maybe I'm the asshole for judging so quickly.",Human
5z9uig,"Just because lack-of-blood doesn't matter doesn't mean that blood doesn't matter.

You're being selfish.",Human
5z9uig,"You seem very insecure. 

Your father loves you, don't waste time doubting that. He gave you more money than he gave his estranged niece, look at it that way, don't look at it as if him showing kindness to her somehow invalidates the love he feels for you.

Every emotion he feels in his heart isn't about you. It's not about you.  His relationship or lack thereof with his granddaugther has nothing to do with how he feels about you. 

People who are insecure and jealous just end up making everything about them, being completely self involved and being an emotional anchor on the people who care about them the most. You've got to let it go.  You're definitely the person with the problem in this scenario.  Let. it. go.  Be grateful you have a father who loves you very much and you still have time with him!",Human
5z9uig,"You are the asshole, but it is hard not to be. I'm sorry. ",Human
5za6tj,"Honestly mighy be best for you to lie but no, I dont think you're an asshole; you're just being truthful",Human
5za6tj,"Not the asshole

On the other hand I think it's a bit assholish to ask your boyfriend if he'd like something, hear him say no, then get upset at him when he doesn't like it.",Human
5za6tj,"Not the asshole. I dyed my hair burgundy a few years ago, and when I asked my boyfriend what he thought about it, he told me truthfully he didn't like it. I was a little bummed because I wanted him to be excited about it with me, but I also appreciated his honesty. He's consistently honest with me, from little to big things, and I know I can count on him to give me his opinion, unfiltered, when I ask for it. Seems only fair, too, since she DID ask you what you thought. ",Human
5za6tj,"Not an asshole. 

These are things you learn as relationships come, go, and progress. Some people want the truth. Some people only want to be told what they want to hear. It can be quite a balancing act and it's fascinating to learn what your boundaries are. Can you lie to keep them happy? Do you tell the truth, even if it hurts them? Good times. 

",Human
5za6tj,I think even small lies like this are really toxic if they get found out.,Human
5za6tj,"but isn't it ""assholish"" to not support your partner in her decisions? It's her body and she chose to dye her hair; why should a woman be a slave to a man's opinions?",Human
5za6tj,"He did not like it and made no comment. Only when pressed did he tell her how he feels. How is she a slave to his opinion? If she didn't care for his thoughts she wouldn't ask.

Also it's not so much a ""man's opinion"" as ""partner's opinion"". I care what my gf thinks of my appearance and if possible will choose an option that is preferable for her since I like that she finds me attractive. What's wrong with that? ",Human
5za6tj,well yeah you should care what the girlfriend thinks about you,Human
5za6tj,She wasn't at all a 'slave' to his opinions - he didn't make an issue about it or try to get her to change it.  He showed her the utmost respect of her individuality and freedom.  In fact he didn't patronise her by pretending to like it.,Human
5za6tj,How is it assholish for him to have an opinion? Why should a man be a slave to a woman's choice? ,Human
5za6tj,"He's not implied at all that she shouldn't do what she wants with her hair, he's just being honest that it's not his preference. She's the one who asked him if he liked the style, heard no, did it and then got upset when his answer to ""do you like the style"" was still no. She set herself up for disappointment by expecting him to change his mind.",Human
5za6tj,"are you insane? he did support her in her decision, but he also has an opinion(a negative opinion in this case) as an individual. Stop trying to make the problem gender based, while it's not, and rather a problem between two individuals.

to take up your words: It's her body and she chose to dye her hair. It's his mind and he chose to not like the dyed hair.",Human
5za6tj,"Are you agreeing with me or are you saying that I should care about my gf's opinion of me but if OP's gf cares about his opinion of her she is a ""slave to a man's opinion""?",Human
5za6tj,"Definitely not the asshole, especially considering that she put out a feeler before actually pulling the trigger. 

Just as she is free to do whatever she wants with her hair, you are free to like or dislike it.",Human
5za6tj,"She asked his opinion and he gave it to her. He didn't tell her not to dye her hair. Was he supposed to lie to her to ""support"" her choice? Because lying makes you an asshole.",Human
5za6tj,"Maybe when someone of any gender asks a question they should get an honest and polite response. He didn't ask her to change or to not do it, she did the dyeing and the asking of her own free will. ",Human
5za6tj,That's just flair for this sub...,Human
5za6tj,"Not if she directly asked him for his opinion.  I don't know what else he's supposed to do here, lie?  ",Human
5za6tj,"Not at all, I'd say your girl is the asshole for being upset with you for an opinion.
",Human
5za6tj,"Not the asshole. You gave her your honest opinion before hand, she dyed it anyway, what other response could she have been expecting?",Human
5za6tj,"Agreed.  You might get away with lying and saying you like the hair style for awhile.  Eventually though, when you drop your guard it's going to come out that you didn't like it and then the girlfriend will feel lied to and foolish for thinking all along that you liked the way she looked.",Human
5za6tj,"""What do you think of this hair?""
""Not my thing.""

Gets it done anyway.

""What do you think?""
""Don't like it.""

I don't know what she was expecting. When it says dead dove, you can't me surprised when there's a dead dove.

Not an asshole.",Human
5za6tj,Ask her if she would rather you lie to her or be honest with her.,Human
5za6tj,"Not the asshole. You didn't give her what she wanted, but you told the truth, and in a polite way",Human
5za6tj,"No? This isn't a matter of gender. If it was a girl who didn't like how her boyfriend dyed his hair, and he got upset about it, the situation would be equal.",Human

This is what I said to her.",Human

5zeqyq,"Not the asshole at all. Everything you said is valid.

5zeqyq,I would suggest not hanging around someone that thinks being high and drunk in school is ok. Man I fucking smoke a lot of weed and drank my fare share but still would never do something like that and especially inform someone I'm doing it. ,Human
5zeqyq,"I honestly do as well, and I'll admit to rarely taking a hit before I goto school sometimes but she claimed to being drunk and high ""af"", which concerned me.",Human
5zeqyq,Getting a little high is different than showing up very crossfaded. You're not an asshole for being concerned for her. ,Human
5zeqyq,"You're not the asshole but you're making a classic mistake young people make. You should stop trying to control your friends and let them make their own choices, no matter how stupid and dangerous ",Human
5zeqyq,"That is not good advice. Giving a friend advice is not the same as ""trying to control"" them. But as you grow up you learn how to be more tactful with your advice and when to let things slide. Obviously with most friends I wouldn't give unsolicited advice, but with my closest? If I thought they were heading down a dangerous path? Of course. I love them like I love my family. I couldn't live with myself if I just sat silent while the worst happened. And I would expect them to do the same for me too.",Human
5zeqyq,"I don't think that you're an asshole, but I do think that you're going to learn over the rest of life a lot more about drugs. It seems weird to you that your friend is gong drunk and high to something like play practice. People get high all the time in different ways and self-medicate for most ailments. You're of course allowed to worry about your friend, but don't worry about them being high for stuff. Worry about the context. ",Human
5zeqyq,Typically unsolicited advice is not that useful even for best friends but I still think that you can take one shot at reasoning with a real close friend even if unasked. Carrying on with it is a no-go though.,Human
5zeqyq,"Yes, berating a friend is not useful. And I'm not saying you should barge in at any opportunity. But certain situations do mean it's appropriate to air your feelings.

As an example, my close friend rexently got a new job with a company which has a real drinking culture. She's out drinking most weeknights and is tired and unfocused the rest of the time. It's not a healthy lifestyle and I said as much to her, albeit framed politely and understatedly. She took this advice well. I'm not going to bang on about it next time I see her; I've made my feelings clear, now it's up to her to decide if she wants to ignore them or not.",Human
5zeqyq,"You were judgmental. People don't tend to respond well to being judged, especially when they haven't asked for it.

This whole situation might have gone down quite differently if you had posted something like:

""I have to be honest with you, I'm really concerned that you went to rehearsals ""high and drunk asf"". It worries me that you'll get kicked out of the play - I know you really wanted to get in it, and I was so proud of you when you were picked! It seems strange to me that you would do this when it's something you care about. Is something else going on that you need to talk about?""",Human
5zeqyq,Getting upset when a friend doesn't follow your advice is indeed trying to control them. You need to learn in life that there are some people you just can't save.,Human
5zeqyq,"I never mentioned getting upset if they don't follow my advice. Where did you get that from? All I'm saying is that sometimes being a good friend means tactfully giving advice. Once you've done that, don't push it.

Also, it's pretty extreme to leap straight to ""there are some people you just can't save"" ",Human
5zeqyq,"I was referring to OP's situation

Getting upset because someone hasn't taken your advice is trying to control",Human

5zeqyq,"You gave advice in an advice thread. I did not think it was good advice so I commented as such. It transpires your advice was predicated on an assumption and not the actual situation so yes, I was a bit baffled. 

I wouldn't really describe this as an argument. But yeah, I think we can both agree we're done here.",Human
5zjdcz,"If she's the only one in the grade competing, then she's first place in her grade; giving her second place seems like a deliberate dick move. If it's a graded project and they thinks it's B work, that's fine. But that grade has no bearing on her relative finishing place. If a runner runs not very fast, and none of their competitors finish, do they get awarded the silver medal because they weren't running fast enough? Of course not, because that's fucking stupid.

It certainly sounds like the school is not making reasonable accommodation for your daughter's medical condition. And it kind of seems like the school staff have their collective head up their ass. That makes them a pile of assholes, and you a concerned parent, not an asshole. ",Human
5zjdcz,"Hi there, 

As a father, I can tell you that there is a clear line between being a good parent and a helicopter parent. 
You could go to the school, climb on the roof with a banner claiming for injustice for your daughter for a week and you STILL wouldn't be the A-hole.

You're a father/mother, you're doing your job. Keep at it!",Human
5zjdcz,"If everything is as you say, I would be equally livid and taking the admin to task over multiple things.  The silver medal is ridiculous and the easiest thing to get higher admin to realize there is a problem with your teacher / lower admin. But more importantly if they are grading your daughter for her speech, and not for her knowledge, when it is a knowledge test and does not have explicit points for speech, then that is a serious problem that needs to be fixed. Who is this crazy teacher?",Human
5zjdcz,"I don't think so. I don't care whether she missed 99/100 days or can pronounce anachronistic, she was the only competitor so first is hers by default. It also sounds like she submitted a pretty good entry regardless. 

The school is being discriminatory and dickish to your daughter, they're the assholes here not you. I'd be taking them to task over all of this. ",Human
5zjdcz,She says she can't give her credit when she isn't certain she us saying the right answer and admin stood by her on it.,Human
5zjdcz,"Not the asshole. You have satisfactory evidence that your daughter is the target of discrimination. If I was in your position, I would lawyer up and raise hell.",Human
5zjdcz,"It is documented and she has an iep for it. She is in speech therapy through the school. They set up 'reasonable accommodations' that included allowing a parent or her speech therapist who don't have problems understanding her assist in academic evaluations. Also, that she was to be allowed more time to finish projects or be assessed because of her medical problems. There were other things, but they have said that the accommodations are things they can provide when they deem it necessary, and the goal is to provide as few interventions as they can do she 'mainstreams' better. They pretty much just use the iep to get her speech therapy funded and not much else. Any interventions that help her they abandon because they want her to learn to do without them. 

I try to be reasonable (I know emotion gets in the way of it sometimes). For instance, I have no problem with them marking her down for legibility even though I know muscle weaknesses and focal seizures affect her writing, since I know she is being graded on what she is actually putting out there. Maybe it is the same, but I don't feel the same about her being graded down as unable to order her numbers just because she says ""fourteen fickteen sickteen sebbateen"" etc. 

I am documenting it. I wanted to make sure this particular case wasn't overly clouded by my emotional response. I appreciate your input.",Human
5zjdcz,"Sorry, my phone isn't letting me fix the wrong their/there. ",Human
5zjdcz,We have been round and round in circles about them writing accommodations into her iep and then not implementing them or dumping them as soon as she improves so she can 'learn to function without intervention'. We definitely don't agree on where to draw the line there.,Human
5zjdcz,"No, it was just her and the teacher who said she had to mark answers wrong because she wasn't sure she understood them. ",Human
5zjdcz,The woman whose supposed to help people understand should always be there,Human
5zjdcz,"This is bullshit.  The whole point of an IEP is to allow the student a way to demonstrate mastery of content in a way where their disabilities are not a factor.  Do they test the blind kids with flash cards?  If they're testing her for knowledge of shapes why are they grading her for pronunciation?  I would start subtly edging your conversations with the administration towards lawsuit territory.

Edit:  Give me some slack, it's been about a hundred years since I've written an IEP, but, as I recall, IEPs include learning goals, SPECIFIC strategies to attain those goals and a clear explanation of the pedagogical principles involved.  It should be fairly easy to tell if they are following the IEP, which they are legally obligated to do.",Human
5zjdcz,"So let me get this straight: they gave her 2nd place for her group, of which she was the only student, and no one got 1st place? Not the asshole. This school has issues. Every single example you gave shows a school handling things poorly. Poorly is a compliment in some of these instances. I would post this over on r/parenting. They have great feedback on dealing with this kind of bullshit. ",Human
5zjdcz,"Honestly, this is BS.  And this is only kindergarten.  In your shoes, I would talk to an attorney who specializes in Special Education and after you've received legal advice, bring that attorney with you for your meeting with the Superintendent.  They are seemingly in violation of IDEA.

http://www.specialneedsalliance.org/",Human
5zjdcz,"I second this suggestion.  My brother has autism and his school was completely awful to him.  They violated the ADA and completely ignored his IEP.  My parents got a lawyer and the lawyer didn't even have to take any action; the second the school saw that the family had a lawyer, they decided to pay to send him to a private school for autistic children which is ordinarily $25k/yr.  ",Human
5zjdcz,"I'd scream at them every single fucking day for the way they're treating your daughter. That's a situation I'd drive for ages just to argue over. 

People like that, whom have children of their own whom are just as if not MORE absent and still being rewarded, are completely in the wrong on that, and shouldn't be able to decide at all. 

This school completely rubs me the wrong way, and I would NEVER want to have a child I know taking classes there. 

All in all, you're not the asshole. The school is. ",Human
5zjdcz,Is it possible for you to look into other schools that might be able to properly educate your daughter? It does seem to me that your daughter is being discriminated against for her disabilities and that you've done a lot of work to make the school stop doing this to her. I would be looking for another school if I were you and had the ability to do so. ,Human
5zjdcz,"Unfortunately there is 1 other kindergarten in town, and I chose this one because of all the horror stories I had heard about how the other school handled special needs.",Human

5zjdcz,"The other school in town actually has a worse reputation for this garbage. I don't know what to do in that regard. Honestly maybe I need to move into a new district, even though it would be difficult. 
Also, just for the sake of clarity, the teacher who's son got the award didn't have a part in deciding will did and didn't get them. That part she can't be blamed for, it was up to the same admin who did the science fair.",Human
5zjdcz,Hearing that I am not crazy to be this pissed actually has me seriously considering what it would take to move into a new school district. ,Human
5zjdcz,"Honestly, I had a really shitty time in grade school, I was a little ADD and had something called a 'tracking' problem with my eyes. I had a teacher who would yell at me a lot over this and basically verbally abused me for my entire first grade experience. My parents tried to make it stop, went to the administration, tons of teacher conferences, but the school never stepped up for me and my family. My parents still regret not moving me to another school, I ended up with a disdain for learning institutions that I still haven't shaken as a college student. You do what's best for you, but I know my parents regret not moving me. A bad school experience early on can shape your feelings about school forever.",Human
5zjdcz,This school sounds like a joke,Human
5zjdcz,Fucking school asshole s. ,Human

5zjdcz,"&gt;since it was a 'solid B grade project' they had made the call that it was more appropriate to give her a second place and just not give out a kindergarten first place at all.

Not the asshole; this is a blatant dick-move.

Is there a school council you could get to work for you?  Meet with the parents that make up the board and get them to start making the school board's life miserable until they fix this.",Human

5zjdcz,"I think you might find that this is more the fire extinguisher than the fuel, but I understand your hesitance.  Still, nothing can be lost by talking to an attorney and holding off mentioning it to the school.  You are her only advocate right now.  Adding another is a good idea.",Human
5zjdcz,"Most of the specifics went into the accommodations section, which I had understood to basically be the laid out procedure for attaining the much broader goal. When I began raising concerns at IEP meetings (we have them quarterly unless a special one is needed) they told me that the accommodations are to be used totally at the school's discretion. It was not what I had understood and was not what I felt I had been lead to believe. The absolute only accomodations they have stuck with have been speech therapy and allowing her to have a special pencil box with varied sizes and grips to help with muscle fatigue in her hands (but I am in charge of providing it all, they just allow her to use it). The IEP has been pretty pointless other than that.",Human

My child is 17 so I've had the long term / been there / done that 20/20 perspective. I hope 17 years of experience will help you as my child had similar issues. 

I'd like you to look at a long term view. These people are treating her like she's an idiot and it won't be long before she catches on to that and starts to believe she's an idiot. If that happens, it doesn't matter what you do from that point forward, her entire life will be one in which she treats herself as stupid. The ramifications are bigger than you imagine. 

Girls who KNOW their value don't fall into the obvious traps. They don't date abusive asshole guys, doing things they aren't comfortable with just for esteem. They don't fall into peer groups that lead them down the wrong path, and so on. But, girls who are insecure about themselves... it never leads down a good road, does it? Be it, looking for esteem in the wrong places or just quietly not apply for the school or job they want due to having the experience of authorities and educators putting them down - there is always a very hard bite back from what your daughter is going through. The good news is, she's young enough to stop it - but just barely. You have to head it off now.

You are focused on today's ribbon but that's the wrong issue. There will be a lot of this kind of small shit always going on to catch your thinking in a web and stop the big picture view. Be careful of that.

It sounds like you are perhaps an introvert.  Introverts typically abhor small talk and find it to be hard-work/anxiety-inducing.  Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone, whereas extroverts recharge their batteries by being with others.  The general public is more accepting of extroverts, and that might be why you're questioning whether or not you're an asshole.  There's a lot of pressure placed on introverts to ""come out of their shells"".  As a VERY extroverted person myself, it has taken me a long time to learn this and be more accepting and accommodating of introverts I encounter.

My husband is an introvert, and finds that he is very willing to talk and engage if a REAL subject of interest comes up and he is talking to someone who is capable of engaging on that subject.  When that happens, he lights up and no one would think to call him an introvert.  But just thrown in a crowd and expected to exchange mundanities which no one cares about or is going to remember and which elucidate nothing, ...nope, he's got no patience for that.",Human

I'm not terribly social either, but I'd like to be so that's something I'm working on for myself. If you want to get better at it, you just have to put yourself out there and try talking to people. The more you do it the easier it becomes.

Lots of employers don't want to waste time or energy on people they feel won't perform optimally, and generally people who don't sound enthused in the first place are red flags for them. 

That being said you're still not the asshole since the other guy could've handled the situation much more professionally. ",Human

Think of it this way: you need a job. He is doing you a favor by offering you one. You aren't doing him any favors by taking it - especially if it sounds like you're not into it. You came off as stuck up and disposable to him when he probably had plenty of other people lined up.

5zngqy,"Interesting that you start by saying you don't like rude people.  No one likes rude people.  Not even rude people like rude people.  Rude is, by definition, a bad characteristic that no one likes.  But everyone has a different definition of what is rude, and different times that they're going to be rude.  Here's the trick for you : how you react to their rudeness changes the options and opportunities you have.  He probably thought you were being rude, and you proved him right (in his mind) by hanging up on him.  If your answer to that is ""I don't care what he thought of me,"" again, you're limiting your options and opportunities.  

I get that you don't want to start working for someone you know is rude.  Smart move on your part, if you can afford it, and it sounds like you can.  However, rude folks will turn up in your job, and by being rude right back to them, you're going to (wait for it) limit your options and opportunities.  React well, and you can go far.  Don't care and you probably won't get a good-paying, happy-making, long-term job.

Everyone's talking about your professionalism. I would be deeply embarrassed to speak to a prospective hire that way. He *started* the conversation unprofessionaly and continued on to sound like a spoiled child that is more interested in fueling his desire to feel wanted than to hire the right person. 

I also cannot put into words how much I detest the attitude that someone is doing you a favor by offering you a job you applied for and are qualified. Being in a leadersgip position doesn't mean your reports are beholden to your arbitrary standards like sounding enthusiastic on the phone.  ",Human

It's like kids at school saying ""he started it"" when they get in trouble: they don't understand the bigger picture, which is that when there is a problem with their behavior, whether or not they started it is irrelevant.

Tl;dr: I would seriously consider finding other words to live by that make you *better* than someone who is rude to you, rather than sinking to their level.",Human

Hopefully he doesn't know anyone in the area who own businesses that you applied to. A lot of small business owners are friendly with each other, in my experience. If that's the case there, he might have connections elsewhere and warns them not to hire you. Sounds crazy but that happened to my cousin and he got blacklisted from most businesses in the town despite his experience. Sometimes it's better to just be the bigger person.",Human

You can be profesional without losing your dignity. ",Human

Any employer that bases their hiring off of tone of voice and not direct questions about their work history and ethic is a shitty employer.

We've all been so brainwashed into thinking that an employer is doing us a favor by offering a job that we can't see that the employer NEEDS us in order to keep the doors open. That guy needs employees a lot more than an employee needs a paycheck from him. An interview is a two way street. That boss failed the interview. He proved he runs a shit show, and frankly, deserves a figurative spanking for how he spoke to a stranger.

Stop thinking that way. This is what keeps the power imbalance between employee and employer so far into the wrong end.",Human
5zngqy,"1. It's factory work. Someone who doesn't take it seriously could get people killed. I guess the boss should ignore a warning sign like that?

2. Your tone of voice (disinterested, excited, happy, sad) and word choice can affect how people see you. I know, it sucks so much that people can't look at your work experience alone, but keep in mind, employers want someone who'll be part of a team. They need to fit in with that team. So it matters a whole lot. 

3. I don't think this boss was a good boss anyway. A slight like someone being overly familiar is small and easy to just say ""you're not worth my time"". It still could have been avoided by OP treating a potential employer with respect. 

4. It's not brainwashing to think you need a paycheck. That's facing reality. If you honestly think that your boss needs you more than you need a paycheck, either you don't need to work (good for you) or you're a skilled worker that can't be replaced (even better for you). By the sounds of it, OP is in neither category. They need a job, and they're not skilled labor. 

Your dignity is important. You do what you need to do to feel good about yourself. But don't equate showing proper respect with losing your dignity, or you're in for a rough ride. ",Human

Ultimately this is a question of trust.  Is he making these comments because he is too weak to share his true opinion with his friends? (A yes-man, if you will.)  Or is he making these comments because philosophically he can sometimes see a justification for cheating?  You have to make the call.  You're not the asshole for listening to your instincts.  

In your shoes, I would tell him (and it sounds like you've touched on it some) how much hearing those comments undermines your trust in him.  

I could make a case for you being the asshole for knowing about the cheating without revealing it to those women if you also know them, but that's a different question.",Human
5zny2o,"I think you should say something to his friends next time it comes up. They sound like assholes. 

They are an important part of your boyfriend's life though. To be accepting of him would be giving those friends a true chance, and if you were to honestly question their empathy (lying to women, etc.) to their face, like a friend might, things could change for the better. Someone in that situation has to take a stand for equality (I think the conversations are promoting a sexist  attitude) or it won't get better. 

The alternative would be to slowly let it eat at you by not saying anything, or simply not being around them. ",Human
5zny2o,"Nah, you aren't. I'd feel the same way in your situation. How long have you been together? I would let him know your feelings before he goes. He may get upset thinking that you don't trust him, but you can bring up the fact that he talks about cheating all the time with his friends and that it makes you uncomfortable.",Human
5zny2o,"Never go against your gut in situations like this. I wouldn't trust him, only because I have been in your exact situation. The phrase, ""watch the company you keep"" is popular for a reason. People, especially young people, have a tendency to become like those they surround themselves with. Now I don't know your boyfriend, so I can't make judgments on him specifically, but consider that if he does cheat he's surrounded by people who would support him. No, you're not the asshole here. Why would he choose to surround himself with dishonest people?

Maybe your boyfriend is a great guy, and there's a chance he would never do anything to hurt you, but you're not wrong for feeling this way. Be careful.

He so happened to be a great guitarist &amp; but kind of scumbag, so we started practicing and writing, but he was unabashed about cheating, etc told me about it. It came to light on of his close friends was a guy who literally did that all the time (cheated) and was kind of a sex addict. I myself was upfront with my GF about him (she didn’t like him but understood and trusted me as it was more about music at that point). 

I was meditating at the time and it’s important to note that I did not condone his behavior or approve it and spoke out against it. However as time went on I developed a bit of “cognitive dissonance” about the situation as I was exposed to this stuff. I was increasing my meditation practice at the time and realized that even associating this this scum, despite being honest with my GF (at the time, now wife) and to him even didn’t change the fact that I was being inundated with his philosophies of why he did what he did, which I didn’t agree with. This seeps into your head, like an advertisement, you don’t think your affected, but you are in a subtle way. So when he started being a bit less trust worthy, I ended the band and my mind was much more peaceful. My point is who you associate with influences who you become and your ideals.

I really don't think it is her place to insert herself into a relationship between her bf and his friends. His relationships are his to manage just as hers are hers. 

Nevertheless, i think your bf is telling you something both in his choice in friends, and what he is saying to them. There is also something uncomfortable going on with how their conversation gets relayed to you. Are you witnessing it or is your bf telling you about it? If it's the latter, why is he sharing this with you when he knows it makes you uneasy.

I don't think you're an asshole at all, but do take a minute to step back a bit and think about who he is as a person.",Human

Before you try to have a come to Jesus conversation with his friends, try to ask him not to share this stuff with you. Say it makes you very uneasy and if he wouldn't mind not passing this stuff on. I think that would be a pretty reasonable request for you to make because i do not really see why he tells you these things. He is not seeking input, so he is looking to vent so on this one topic let him vent to the mirror.",Human

If Panera had an issue with this, the manager would come talk to you. Not to mention that fountain drinks have a massive markup. You'd probably have to get at least 10 refills before the store would be losing money. Now, if a manager came and talked to you and you were a dick to him about it then yeah, you'd be an asshole. 

But if you're still worried about it, next time you're in just politely ask to speak to the manager for just a minute. Then explain to the manager what you've been doing and ask them if they'd prefer that you quit doing that. Problem solved. ",Human

I just like going there to read and I'm not always in the mood for their food. Thanks for the help all.",Human

5zyvla,"I'm going to take an apparently unpopular opinion here and say it depends on the circumstances.  I worked for Panera for 12 years before leaving for the healthcare industry - from cashier to manager to training team, so I can give you the basic opinion of the Panera people.

They probably don't care unless you are taking up a table when they are full/ mostly full.  If people who bought lunch there are looking for a table and have to bring their food back to be repackaged because you are sitting there with your pizza, you are a supreme asshole and they secretly judge you.  If the tables are half empty, they could not care less if you sit there (in fact, that's fairly common because of the wifi).  It's good you buy a drink.  Ultimately, if there was no one who lost a seat, Panera didn't lose money, so they don't care.

As far as the free refills go, take em.  I'm just glad you aren't filling up a water cup with soda.  The sodas are meant to have free refills - that's why they leave the soda machine out front for you.  And the staff wouldn't mind if you mentioned sometime that you appreciate them letting you sit there.  Also, consider buying a cookie because those things are freaking addicting.",Human

5zyvla,"He's getting an unlimited amount of free refills when only buying one drink. That means he gets as many drinks as he wants for a few dollars.

It's kind of like putting your backpack on the seat next to you on public transit. There's no reason to hug your bag on an empty train but you're a dick of the highest order during rush hour. Food is a little different. There's concerns around bringing outside food in, but since it's a mall it's a little more ambiguous. Still not the most respectful/classy move.

If it were me I'd stop doing it. Best practice, either buy food at Panera or don't sit there.",Human

For the purposes of math, let's say 12 oz brix'ed soda (soda syrup mixed with carbonated water) costs 5 cents, and Panera sells it for two bucks. You'd have to drink FORTY SODAS IN ONE SITTING just for Panera to BREAK EVEN.

Now, the numbers may be a bit higher or a bit lower, but my point is, unless you're a camel, don't EVER feel bad about drinking as much soda as you want at a restaurant. The restaurant is not losing money on that.",Human

You were a bully and with the way you wrote this it blatantly shows that your mentality has not changed. You are a very jealous and insecure person.

You admit to wilfully making this woman's homelife as intolerable as you could and now, years later, you still blame her for wanting to leave that situation. You rationalize that all was forgiven because you gave her an animal that you admit you couldnt care for. 

She moves onto a happy life despite what you did. She decides to reach out to you after what, a decade? She starts by complimenting your new child and address the elephant in the room in the form of a joke. Most people who acted as despicable as you would have taken that as a chance to genuinely apologize for how you acted years ago.

But instead of seeing this as an opportunity to make amends and catch up on life you want to read into it.

Do you want to know why?

Because making a passive aggressive jabe at is something you would do to somebody. You are still the same jealous bitter person you were back then. You are the type of person who actively seeks to stir the pot and then complain about drama. 

With all that being said, incase I didn't make myself clear; you are in fact the asshole.

You likely have the type of friends that reinforce your own beliefs about situations (omg can you believe she said that? Then all your friends probably chime in, agreeing). This prevents you from facing the truth you already know about yourself: That you're an asshole who degrades other people because it grants you a brief respite from your own self loathing. 

In all likelihood you're either married to a doormat of a man who lets you insult his manhood constantly for bi-yearly sex he doesn't even enjoy, or you're a single mother who was pumped and dumped. Either way I pray to god that you go to therapy and learn to be a better person for the sake of your child because being raised by a person like you will likely create either A. a fearful child with severe self esteem issues who will be afraid to stand up for themselves their entire life, or B. an equally mean hearted, self loathing copy of you.

Were either of you entirely blameless? No, but you certainly by your own admission acted very badly towards her.

I have a kid and another one on the way and my life is so full of the stuff that comes with being an adult and a parent I just cannot fathom being upset over something like this especially to the degree that I would write a long post on reddit (and repost it across several subreddits). If someone from my past sent me a fb message that I perceived as bitchy or passive aggressive or whatever I would spend exactly two seconds removing said person from friends list and give exactly zero fucks about it.

You cannot blame your actions on being 'dumb college girl stuff' because that's a cop out. You cannot mature and be a good person until you own your faults. You're STILL catty and jealous of her. 

Frankly, I can't blame her for wanting to gtfo of that apartment. What was she to say, I have a new condo, because you guys are bitches? You'd tear her apart for being 'a rich daddy's girl' because you were already jealous of her dad and his earnings. 

I would assume that Gabby is testing what kind of a person you are. Have you really softened, and realized what you did to her, or are you still cruel Andrea? Your half-assed apology was not enough, I'm sure she wants closure. Acknowledgement of what you did.",Human
603xyk,"Well done, you. That's who you are, the good and the ugly, and the good is all the more worthy for having the ugly acknowledged and dealt with, next to it. I'm glad YOU'RE doing well as well as your old college mate.",Human
603xyk,"Youre saying it shouldnt matter to me anymore... clearly it matters to HER as SHE added ME, not the other way around, and she sent me the strange message!! Calling me cruel and saying she hopes I'm a better person or whatever. Seems like shes trying to cause drama or get a reaction out of me. ",Human
603xyk,"Oh wow, you think I should block her? She's a borderline bitch? Interesting :)
Yeah I crossed that line a long time ago BUT I apologized for it and gave her a CAT, and here she is adding me and messaging me, YEARS later. ",Human
603xyk,so you do think she's passive aggressive! Ha!,Human
603xyk,"It wasn't moving out, it was an escape plan. If you were that nasty to her when you were ""friends"", what could she expect from you when you found out she was leaving? She was right to do this behind your back for her own well being. ",Human
603xyk,"Even if she was being passive aggressive (which most of us don't think she was), that's an incredibly mild response to how you treated her. 

You are the asshole. Instead of seeking validation for your behavior, perhaps take the words of everyone in both threads to heart, and try and change. You still hold this bullying mentally in your 30s which is quite concerning.",Human
603xyk,"Your upset over this seriously baffles me, if you really think that she's the one trying to cause drama and get a reaction (which from reading what you posted she said, it really does not read that way) just delete her and forget it. Why are you here looking for justification to get into a fight with her? Who cares what matters to her. 

My former room mate was the one to add me on fb a few yrs ago and my reaction was literally 'oh shit haven't seen that name in awhile' and that was the end of it. She was even a room mate who moved out unexpectedly on me and the third girl we were living with... she just left to move in with her boyfriend without telling us, pissed me off at the time, sucked for us for a month or so, I could not care less about it today. I don't interact with her other than liking some shit about cats she posts on her wall from time to time. You are a parent why is this something that is upsetting you so much? I don't get it. 

Regardless of what you may think she is doing right now can you just try to understand that you were terrible to her all those years ago and maybe you have no right to be indignant about this? From your story in your own words you sound like you were an abusive friend. Maybe get over yourself give her a kind message in return thanking her for complementing your child and its nice to see she is doing well too, and let that be it? Do you really think blowing up and starting a whole fight with her now is worthwhile? ",Human
603xyk,Yeah.. I wonder who she bullies.. Her husband? Her kids? ,Human

Are you even serious? You even actually bolded that text to draw attention to it?  You say yourself that you and your other roommate busted her chops for years because you ""loved watching her get worked up"" and try to paint it as catty when she takes steps to get herself the hell away from you? 

Not only are you *still* the asshole, you're evidently a bully and just a shitty person overall, too. ",Human
603xyk,"Seriously, she's messaging you to say she's happy that you're happy. She's reaching out and giving you an olive branch (even though it sounds like it should be the other way around). She's telling you that even though you were (in her words) cruel, she felt that you were going through tough times and were ""broken"". She's being nice.

It honestly just sounds like she's being nice, though perhaps a little naive. You've acknowledged that you behaved badly and she's giving you the benefit of the doubt and saying that it was because you were going through something.",Human
603xyk,"""I was a total asshole to her/bitch, but i gave her a cat so that should balance out"". You asked if you were an asshole and yet you act like a half assed sorry and cat makes it all better.

603xyk,"Got to the second paragraph and I didn't need to read any more. Of course you're an asshole. You're a bully, just an awful person.i hope you change.

She did nothing wrong and probably made a wise move to get out how/when she could.",Human
603xyk,"Enormous unrepentant asshole, sorry OP.

You sound like her contacting you at all has touched on some old anger and resentment you still hold towards this woman. Please resist any urge to try to start bullying her again and just stay focused on your own life.",Human

603xyk,"Of course you're an asshole. I'd go as far to say you were a down right terrible person. You deserved to be left high and dry back then. That's what happens when you're a terrible abusive  roommate.          
           
She said you used to be a broken person because you were a broken person. You clearly haven't come as far as she thinks though. After all, you're reaction to all of this is still very petty and you're playing to blame game as if to minimize your own cruelty. On top of that, you still don't recognize that you were broken insecure person back then.

The decision to keep quiet was almost certainly an act of self defense. No, I don't think it's petty, passive-aggressive or catty, I think she was trying to save herself from two inexplicably terrible attackers who hated her for no apparent reason and made it their mission to hurt her repeatedly.

607q6h,He is in the wrong. No question. ,Human
607q6h,Thing is that I don't know how to make him understand that. I explained it as best as I could in multiple different ways and he told me that he understands my side but that he doesnt like it at all and that he's not going to Ever be okay with it and that it makes him angry. ,Human
607q6h,"Your Not the asshole. Your gut is right, he is controlling. He tries to defend himself and call himself a victim when you call him out on it, that's controlling behavior. Always listen to yourself. Your right about this. Whether he wants to change and do something about it, that's up to him. If he doesn't then consider leaving him. ",Human
607q6h,"I just dont understand why he is so unwilling to see my side. I feel that I've let him talk me into such a corner, and I don't like to think about it because if I lose my mind on him he's going to be so much worse. But he's so stubborn on things and it's getting to be too much, and this is another example of that where he can't push past his feelings. ",Human
607q6h,"I don't think you need to make him understand he's being controlling. He's doing that on purpose. Now you get to decide whether you're okay with being with someone who wants to control you. 

Personally, this is a deal breaker for me. I don't want to control my SO and expect them to not want to control me. A partnership has no need of one half having the upper hand or power over the other half. Also, people who start out trying to control their SO end up wanting more power and more control. ",Human
607q6h,A part of me fears telling him this because I am afraid of how the conversation will go. He's very intense and I am not that. I don't want us to end up screaming at each other. I don't want him to slip up in his anger and say something that I won't ever forgive. I think we're already in that place of him applying control and now wanting more. ,Human
607q6h,Give him an ultimatum. He either goes to a therapist to talk things out so he can really find the underlying issue to his insecurities or he loses you. Be firm about it. Your strong. And go through with what you say. ,Human
607q6h,"The more you say, the more it sounds like you should probably just get out of the relationship. Do you really wanna stay in a relationship where your partner will continuously seek to control you more?",Human
607q6h,thats literally what I am sitting here thinking about ,Human
607q6h,"So many red flags he's waving. Do you see them? You should take a step back and look at all those flags. 

Honestly, seriously, not trying to be mean or condescending in any way, but I am about to turn 45 and, if I had someone tell me to not date controlling assholes when I was 22, I would have saved myself so much trouble and pain and time. So, I'm just going to tell you: do not date controlling assholes. You deserve way more than anything he is capable of giving you. ",Human
607q6h,"You're absolutely not the asshole. My last SO would say the exact same thing; and would get super pissed when I would do things spontaneously. We also had a pretty big age gap between us. I ended up completely miserable and leaving since he wouldn't give me any leeway. Hopefully he can change his controlling behavior. If he doesn't, you might end up where I did. 😔",Human
607q6h,"I feel like that's also the thing is that he wants to tie me down and I want to be able to do things! Like he says that I am the love of his life, and honestly - that scares the shit out of me. I don't know if that notion makes me MORE controlling because in his head he may feel that he has... ownership to me and this relationship. I don't know. ",Human
607q6h,"Yep, he wanted to do the same thing to me. It sucks for sure. We were engaged when I finally realized I was unhappy and I'm so grateful that I didn't go through with it (I'm now happily married). Think about what you want with your life right now and in the next five years and compare it with what he wants. Maybe they aren't the same thing and he's scared he'll lose you if you figure that out, so he's trying to control you. ",Human
607q6h,I honestly think that its all of that and then some. ,Human
607q6h,"I'm really sorry. It's such a tough situation. Remember that you are allowed to be ""selfish"" and make sure that you are happy before anyone else. You can always send me a message if you need someone to talk to about it! You'll be fine either way!",Human
607q6h,Thank you so much ,Human
607q6h,"How would you feel if he went out getting drunk with his friends and dancing with whomever, without telling you, while you were sleeping at home?  You're completely ok with that? Then not an asshole. Otherwise guess what?",Human
607q6h,"Is he telling you NOT to go to bars, or simply to be considerate and let him know what you're doing? How serious are you two? 

I feel it would be appropriate and expected to let someone know of your general plans (for example ""I'm going to bed early so be quiet,"" ""I'm going out to the movies so phones off,"" ""I'm going out with friends to the bar so I can't hang out tonight,"" etc.) in lots of types of relationships not strictly romantic even. I think it would certainly be expected that you tell your husband whom you live with if you're going to be away for the night. I would be miffed if my fiancé simply wasn't home one evening and didn't tell me he had plans until last minute. I think most people would agree that's reasonable. When does that change though? You've been together for nearly a year. Is it that unrealistic for him to want you to tell him your weekend plans?",Human
607q6h,I can see that point. But I don't dance with strangers. And I did let him know about it the moment the plans were made. I can't predict when things will happen. He would rather I don't do things spontaneously. ,Human
607q6h,"If he's already made you afraid of talking to him, then he already is controlling you in more subtle ways. This is, without a doubt, the first step in a long and abusive relationship unless you cut and run immediately. 

He's never going to let you ""win.""

You're never going to make him see the error of his ways. 

This isn't how this plays out. If you up and leave him, he might try to hound you to reconcile, promising you the moon and stars if you just give him another chance. But he won't follow through. It'll slip back into controlling behavior and probably escalate. If you stay away from him, instead of really considering how his behavior affected you, he'll go around to all your coworkers and tell them what a crazy bitch you are. At this point it'll all be aggression to deal with his wounded ego. He'll want to make you hurt like he hurt. Not because he gave a shit about you, but because he was rejected. And these are the positive outcomes. 

These are the warning signs women ignore before they become victims of physical domestic violence. He's 27. He's not going to change. He's an asshole. Leave immediately. ",Human
607q6h,The thing is they weren't plans. They were literally spontaneous plans that I texted him about the moment it happened. I very rarely go out so I chose that last night was the night. ,Human
607q6h,"It sounds disrespectful and inconsiderate to me still. I always run plans by the fiancé. I don't need to. I could just say ""I'm not coming home from work, I'm going out with friends."" Hell, he'd probably appreciate the alone time! I rarely go out either, but I still like to check in with him. On the rare occasion I ask ""Hey this weekend I'm going to friends for some drinks is that cool?"" he never has a problem with it. I still like to check in. Maybe he wanted to do something that night. Maybe he'd like to tag along. (Both very unlikely!) I don't know, I just think it's considerate to let him know my plans and make sure he doesn't have any objections. ",Human
607q6h,"If you do decide to leave him, remember JADE. Don't Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain. You've already told him, he's too controlling and you don't like that. Anything else you say is just an avenue for manipulation.",Human

607q6h,"If he did what I did last night, I would be very annoyed by it if it was a common place thing. If it wasn't I would definitely feel a little unsure, maybe a little wary of what he was doing with his buddies especially at a bar where there is alcohol involved.

If he didnt mention it at all through the night while he was out i'd be pissed. ",Human
607q6h,"&gt;maybe a little wary of what he was doing with his buddies especially at a bar where there is alcohol involved.

Ok now add that you found out your plans by being woken up by a phone call as it was happening. I certainly wouldn't be happy about it.  Sounds more like you both have some communication issues during disagreements.  I don't think either of you are assholes. Sounds like normal stuff.",Human
607q6h,"Yes, if he isn't comfortable with it than either try to be more accommodating or break up with him. Don't just fuck with him.",Human

&gt;I explained to him that THAT was controlling, calling me - opening the conversation and then the moment things dont go his way he ends it and I have no choice but to oblige because its a phone call. He goes 'because I don't want to talk about it anymore. I want to sleep.'

Good on you for seeing right through that, even in the moment. Time for him to go, methinks.",Human

There's nothing there to be mean or condescending about. The OP sees through this a hell of a lot better than most people would of any age.",Human
607q6h,"You were fine OP honestly, you're young and wanted to have fun with your friends there's nothing wrong with that. I'm not sure if you live together or not but it sounds like not, frankly he's lucky he got a heads up if that's the case. Why should he care if you go to a bar or not? If there's any sort of trust in your relationship it shouldn't matter where you are, you are trusted to behave appropriately. 

Like, my husband is away a LOT for work. He's been away for over half a year at some stages. A lot of the time I can't contact him at all, let alone run it by him that I'm planning to go out. So you know what I do? I bloody well go! I'm not going to sit at home and wither away just to appease some bullshit idea that I *might* cheat. I could cheat when I went grocery shopping if i was so inclined. When he's home I tell him where I'm going to double check we didn't have plans or just because he might wonder where I am but there's no asking permission. I'm an adult, I go where I please as does he. I assure you OP it is possible to be an autonomous person in a relationship and be happy. ",Human
607q6h,"How is it controlling to want to be told beforehand and not at past midnight? Being extremely angry maybe, but I'd be a bit irritated at it myself.

Not to mention going to bars without your partner is definitely not an ""in a relationship"" activity and much less past midnight with a friend you didn't mention the gender of.

On the other hand he seems a bit of a dick and unable to communicate properly. More likely than not it's the whole going out to bars without him with a possibly male best friend past midnight that's bothering him and not the whole you didn't tell him beforehand and he's just worried to tell you because you'll call him controlling.

It's pretty clear you two aren't compatible but I wouldn't call either of you two an asshole. ",Human

607q6h,"It is okay for you to end the relationship. No relationship should make you feel bad in any way. Feeling controlled, unable to express your true feelings without repercussion, do things without them, etc. are always one can feel bad and are valid reasons to end a relationship. 

Don't judge a relationship and make a decision to continue it based on your best days but on your worst. ",Human

Perhaps you wouldn't mind being woken up after midnight by your SO calling to tell you he is at a bar dancing with his friends without you. But he does, maybe he feels rejected,  maybe he doesn't trust your friend, maybe he is concerned for you safety, maybe he feels he is in a loving committed relationship and it is inappropriate for his girlfriend to go clubbing without him, maybe he is controlling IDK him or the nature of your relationship.   I do know that if either I or my SO did what you did, the other would be upset. ",Human
607q6h,"Never heard of this, but it's solid advice. 

Similar to the suggestion ""when you do x, it makes me feel y.

Because in my world, this is not ""normal stuff"". ",Human
607q6h,"Sorry, but that's not the ""bottom line"" here. How is her living the life that makes her happy, being considerate by advising him in advance, and trying to discuss it with him, not the textbook model of treating someone with respect? I totally disagree with you. 

Also, you added a lot of ""maybe he was..."" items, ~~when OP clearly indicated the boyfriend agreed his anger was unjustified. ~~ edit - no, she didn't say that part, sorry. ",Human
607q6h,"&gt; Not to mention going to bars without your partner is definitely not an ""in a relationship"" activity

If one is in a committed relationship that means you choose actions that reflect that. ,Human
607q6h,"Agreed, except for the narcissistic part. Sadly, just treating another with kindness doesn't mean it will be reciprocated. And when it's clear that it's not a level playing field, that's the time you have to decide if it is a losing battle. ",Human

607q6h,The fact that you're afraid of bringing up reasonable concerns with him because of how he may react is really worrying. No one should have that feeling of constantly walking on eggshells in a healthy and supportive relationship. Stand up for yourself and ask him to get help or seriously consider leaving him.

609ddj,"&gt;Also, driving with alcohol in your system is fucking irresponsible regardless of the amount that has been drunk. That's shameful behaviour. 

The laws are what they are for a reason. If they're under the legal limit, they can drive. And if not, then we need much stricter restrictions on all people driving. Most old people shouldn't be allowed to drive at all. Not to mention trick drivers that pull long shifts and are almost surely more debilitated from fatigue than a person is from 2 drinks.

My dad at double the legal limit could drive better than the average 16 year old with a license. I'm not saying he should drive drunk, but the point is that if you think its ""shameful"" to drive after drinking anything at all, then you'd better also have a problem with young people driving, old people driving, and people driving shortly after waking up or while getting tired, because all of those conditions have an effect comparable to driving after a couple drinks.

I still think they're the asshole, but not for having someone who had had a little bit to drink drive. ",Human
609ddj,"You are absolutely the asshole. If she had backed out of an earlier promise to drive she would be an asshole, but no. You tried to force her to drive when she's uncomfortable doing so. You might know the area but she doesn't and she is well within her rights to refuse to drive. 


Plus you took her to a bar you knew she wouldn't enjoy when she's your guest. ",Human
609ddj,"I can see your viewpoint, but I'll have to respectfully disagree. I don't think it should be lawful to drive with alcohol in your body. You're operating heavy machinery where it can go so wrong so fast, why take the risk? I think it's irresponsible to put the safety of you, your passengers and other road users at risk by deciding to have a beer or maybe two. 

&gt;then we need much stricter restrictions on all people driving.

&gt;you'd better also have a problem with young people driving, old people driving, and people driving shortly after waking up or while getting tired. 

To be honest, I do have a problem with elderly people driving and I think they should be required to take their test again when they're older to demonstrate that they can still able to drive. My father stopped driving when he developed diabetes and lost feeling in his feet, but I worry that there are folk who still drive when they shouldn't be. I think restrictions are bit totalitarian, maybe lean more towards education and regular check ups.",Human
609ddj,"That's a fair point of view. At least you're not hypocritical about it. But in that case, could we set up a system where people drink until they're at .08 and then take a driving test equivalent to the check up test? 

If not, we're just blindly assuming that being drunk is inherently detrimental to driving skills but being old somehow inherently *isn't*, when realistically, both are almost always a detriment to driving ability.",Human
609ddj,You drove you should have stayed sober. Just because you didn't account for your friend's insecurities doesn't make her the automatic DD.  Bottom line you fucked up by drinking without clearing a ride beforehand and expecting your sober albeit bit of a pussy friend to drive when she's not comfortable. You're a bit of a irresponsible drinker asshole. Plan ahead next time.,Human
609ddj,I agree. I feel nervous about driving in certain situations as well and my girlfriend understands completely even if it means she has to take an unfair load of a road trip.

609ddj,I think it's different here in Australia but all new drivers have to have a little card on the front and back of their car identifying them as new so other drivers can act accordingly. I think that's a pretty good system and don't know why it isn't used not.,Human
609ddj,"In Minnesota we have those for driver training vehicles (vehicles used specifically in drivers ed class, driven by people with a provisional license accompanied by a licensed drivers ed teacher), which you only need to pass a written test for.

60did7,"The next customer's order will probably not be within one penny of a dollar. They also don't care about a penny. People know that 1 penny is okay, 10 cents is not.

 I work at a coffee shop and when people are short a penny it's alright. They ask if we have a spare penny politely. This is how they communicate that they would not like 99 cents in coins. People often leave without their coin change too. This is why and how take a penny leave a penny dishes exist. We have a makeshift one on the register counter as well. More people leave without their nickels and dimes than people who ask for pennies. 

It is common for places to not care about that one penny. This is probably why she expected to get a full bill back. Expecting that penny was not that big of a deal. Her being rude about it was what was a big deal. She never communicated that she didn't want coins.
Even just yesterday at the convenience store, my total was 6.99. I gave him $7. He asked me if I wanted the penny, and it was no big deal. ""Keep the penny"" is a saying I hear 2-3 times while at work. ",Human

If it makes you feel any better, in Germany the cashier will literally count out 99 euro-cents if that is what your change is supposed to be.

To me, it has the appearance of being very cheap. ",Human
60did7,"You probably wouldn't. We have a certain threshold at my company where we won't even attempt to retain business because the time investment and goodwill cost exceeds their total value. I also have fired clients because the time they spend complaining and throwing fits without a real/reasonable solution attached is not worth their business. 

These things always seem cut and dry in theory but the whole ""customer is always right"" attitude is a great way to waste time and money. Also, $10 says she comes back within a month. These types of assholes are so predictable. ",Human
60did7,"Man this one is hard. Id be totally pissed to get 99 cents in change. Its just a common courtesy to forget about the penny..I mean even at Walmart and other large businesses. She was a massive cunt about it though. Id say you were both being assholes in different ways. It would be easier for you to just grab a dollar instead of counting out all the change, especially since its a family owned place and shes a regular customer that Im guessing you have personally helped before. She could have been a lot nicer about asking for that common courtesy. I think the lesson here is that if the change is 0.96 or more just give them a dollar instead and take the pennies from the leave a penny take a penny thing. If you don't have one, make one. ",Human

There is a real cost to:

* Retraining, because employees quit due to abuse from customers.
* Other customers not feeling as happy in the environment.
* Having asshole customers hold up the line, or make demands that cost more time and work from the staff.

Most often, workers are simply told to bend over backwards because management doesn't trust their judgement.

As a customer, if the cashier spots you the penny then you say thank you.  If they don't for some reason then you take your change and proceed with your day.  

When I cashiered I paid very close attention to the over/under of my drawer.  Sometimes customers left extra money and I could afford to spot others small amounts of change.  Sometimes I could spot customers small amounts of change on the assumption that in the future someone else would make up the difference.  But sometimes it just wasn't working out, my drawer was short, and I needed to focus on getting my drawer back to being balanced.  Sometimes you can't afford the courtesy.  And that's what it is, a courtesy.  A courtesy should never be expected, only appreciated when it happens. ",Human

I would expect my staff to be able to deal with a occasional rude customer. That comes with the territory. Again, abusive no, rude yes. 

Apparently op said she came back and was cussing at him. At that point yes, i dont want her business anymore. But in the situation in question i still want her money and would chalk it up as her having a bad day.",Human

60did7,"You really missed the point here. It's not about a penny. That's a no brainer for a good customer. The type whose *first* response is to argue with the cashier is not a good customer. Everyone has a bad day but 99.9% of the time, situations like that are indicative of how someone views and interacts with the world. If your response to such an incredibly minor issue like not wanting coins is to lash out at my front line staff, you're almost definitely a bad customer I don't have a problem losing. If you continue - if you don't just leave, but come back and hurl insults at him, then you can get fucked.

You also need to respect the role of front line employees. In many cases, they don't have the discretion to give discounts or adjust the total. If I hear from a front line employee that a regular was frustrated with a situation like this, I'd make changes like pricing at 25 cent increments, putting out a take-a-penny tray or letting the cashier decide to round within a certain threshold. If he told me that got screamed at by some entitled nutcase because she prefers folding dollars, again, that lady can get fucked. 

I run a service line for my company. I deal with these kinds of things all the time. I've written off *hundreds* in goodwill for reasonable customers and will continue to do so.

Have you ever run your own business or line of business or is this all theoretical for you? ",Human
60did7,"Thats because it was not up for debate. They should have that discretion. My opinion differes from yours in terms of dealing with rude customers. My opinion is that simply offering a quick apology and giving her no coins moves everything along. When i did retail i had discretion on certain things, but my employer was very clear on what boundries i had. You get asshole customers, snarky customers and wonderful customers. Dealing with assholes is part of it. Again an abusive customer is not a customer. Get their ass out asap. But it seems like op had an option to give her no coins, but did anyway. Thats ok, but i would rather my employee just give the lady bills to shut her up, keep the line moving and not make a scene. Again, thats just me. ",Human

She may have already spent money based on how many bridesmaids she has, her groom might have already spent money on a groomsman he has to get because you are a bridesmaid.

My point, you being flaky and saying yes when you shouldn't have said yes could have hurt other people.  You're not an asshole because you're poor, you're an asshole because you carelessly said yes and then want to back out on your word.

You're an asshole because it should have been easy for you to figure out that you can't afford to be a bridesmaid when she initially asked you.

You should have said no from the beginning. Saying yes yes yes and allowing people to think you're going to do something, and then backing out after they've already invested in your own words of yes--- and your situation in life hasn't changed at all-- is an asshole move.

I had a friend who I think ended up in this situation with me. I was the bride, and she was the reluctant bridesmaid. She agreed, it was close to where she lived and all she had to do was buy the dress and show up. I got a face to face confirmation with her but every other chance I tried to make contact with her, she never replied.

I facebook messaged her, called her, text her all with no reply. Day of the wedding came and she didn't show, no calls or anything in between. What hurt was that she still liked a few of my FB posts and was still posting regularly on FB. Had she simply contacted me and let me know that she was: 
A. Unable to afford the dress, and instead would just want to be present
B. Wasn't interested or just unable to go for ""her goldfish died""... 

I just wanted something... but instead I got nothing and ended up losing another friend because even six months to if not longer after my wedding she still never contacted me.

I would advise, if you'd like to have a successful romantic relationship, that you look into getting counseling that will help you move past the issues with touch, even if it's just in the context of a significant other.  Casual friends and total strangers don't need to be touching you all the time, but a love interest does need to be touched now and again.

Just be careful with throwing out little comments like ""you are talking to a biologist."" People like me who chose not to continue with their education after high school constantly get treated like just because we don't have a university degree we clearly don't know anything about anything complex.

Is it pretending though? OP wasn't trying to make any particular argument about biology. He was merely confirming the fact that his biology background means he understood basic biology. OP and friend weren't arguing over biological processes or theories when OP used his line.

Additionally, in a casual conversation with a friend, OP would definitely be the more authoritative person on this subject. Sure, he's not a ""real"" biologist.

I think this depends. If you're having a discussion with someone about a biological process, I think the biologist has a bit of an upper hand even if they're not necessarily correct.

Also the level of the discussion prior to that meant that his friend's garden path of ""here's why you shouldn't interact with a girl I find disgusting (in 17 abstract steps!)"" got cut off hard. Not that there was any deceit. 

""Do you know how Chlamydia spreads? But *do* you?"" meant that  it wasn't an actual question, just a premise to get to his next point. The next point really could only be something about how any sexual contact with this specific girl can't be totally safe. It's a shit point that doesn't need to be made.

Dude was shaming OP for his interest in women, OP didn't take the bait, did so unfortunately while claiming a title he hadn't yet earned, and the guy spazzed out and latched onto that detail, completely jettisoning his original ""valid"" point because clearly that tack wasn't working. 

If a conversation about whether or not a girl you both know has a disease that might be catching ends up devolving into a pedantic argument about what conditions are needed for job titles to be used colloquially, I doubt the first topic was really that pressing to either of them.

Throwing rocks at people is an asshole move. Throwing a rock at a guy attacking an old lady to break up the assault wouldn't be assholery. 

Almost every post that isn't a shit post or a self-congratulatory backpat deals with actions that without context look like asshole moves. Just to have a discussion we have to ignore that rule in these cases. Falling back to that is almost like saying ""I still don't like it, you're a dick.""

Think of it this way, there was a court clerk in Kentucky who thought gay marriage was immoral and people who did it were going to face divine punishment... so she decided she was going to implement her own values on her job and deny them the right to get married.  The courts ruled that it's not her position to enforce her personal values, instead she needed to enforce her employer's values, the Federal Government of the USA.

We learned early on that no one wants honest advice, no matter how loving.  EX: Sarah had miserably spoiled kids who showed she and her husband no respect and outright disrespect.  Everyone around us knew it and dreaded seeing her kids coming.  They literally locked her out of the car and sat inside laughing at her while she grew ever more desperate and shrill at them.  She begged my wife for advice and her opinion.  Wife told her no.  Told he she didn't want anyone to tell her about her kids.  She insisted.  Wife finally gave in and had a heart to heart about boundaries, and her being the one in charge as the adult.  Last conversation they ever had and bad mom told people what a bitch my wife was.   That's just the first of three incidents before we learned our lesson.  ",Human
612f22,"Not the asshole. 

You did exactly the right thing. As a teacher, or a babysitter, when you speak with the parent about a child you always give them a positive comment, tell them something the child needs to work on, and then finish up with a positive comment. So, you absolutely did the correct thing in regards to parental discussion. Your boss is right when he said some parents are overly sensitive and just cannot take criticism of their child. Unfortunately, it's the child who suffers over it, not them.",Human

When she said that they were working on saying please at home, you didn't need to pile on about him not saying please to you. Her agreeing with you/telling how they were trying to fix it was a polite way of saying ""we know it's an issue, thank you for bringing it to my attention"" but going on makes it seem like you're doubting her parenting skills which is a touchy thing for many parents.

This is a learning curve for every new child caregiver. I've known one of my girls' kindergarten teachers for 3 years now and I know her teaching style and every time she points out areas that are lacking I have to step back and remember that it's nothing against me or my parenting. It's in the best interest of my child.",Human

It really depends on exactly how the conversation went. If she asked ""How did Jimmy behave today?"" then you're absolutely fine.

But ""How was Jimmy's day today?"" is NOT the same thing. In this case, she's not asking for you to critique the nuances of her kid's behavior. Doing so unsolicited a) is not your job and b) could appear very judgmental.

The kid's three years old, for crying out loud. He's still learning the very basics of language. Obviously you want to be teaching him manners, but it's not like this is some big problem at this point in time.",Human

If a kid is behind in any of these areas (usually socially), the teacher can't do much without help from the parent. Most of the time, the kid doesn't listen to the teacher and only listens to their parent. It's pointless to teach a kid one thing and he doesn't do it at home, or he ONLY does it at home. 

Talking to the parent, maybe they have fixed it at home already and they can tell you how to fix it at school, or they can work on it at home while the teacher works on it at school. Teachers are only with them so long, they aren't there all the time to fix problems. 

I don't believe in holding back with the parents. They need to (and most of them want to) know how their kid is progressing and what can be done to help. Thinking your kid is perfect and not being willing to hear negatives about them is how sociopaths develop. ",Human

So if you are wanting some thoughts/advice, here goes... 

You have realised that you are initiating all social contact and that makes you feel like the friendship is one-sided. And you might be right. Or maybe it's simply that you reach out so often that the two of you have gotten into a habit where you start the communications and he responses when you do. Not necessarily a bad thing, if you're willing to be the main instigator of contact.

But naturally your concern is that your friend doesn't value your friendship in the same way you value his, so you've decided to put that to the test by waiting for him to initiate contact for once. Again, no bad thing. I honestly do not understand why your wife would see that as an assholish thing to do.

Whilst your friend may have encouraged you to move to this city, he is not responsible for finding friends for you. It was nice that he said he'd introduce you to his circle, but that doesn't stop you from getting out there and making new friends yourselves. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.",Human

I'm trying to get my sleep schedule on track to get up on time. In the meantime, can we try X?""

As far as them talking about you, they seem to have a problem, and that is you not getting your ass out of bed in the mornings.

Me: Hmm no apology. Glad to know you're still big enough to never admit your wrongdoing because it doesn't exist and you're perfect. That's why I'm so gosh darn broken up about our break up. Why did I ever let you go?",Human
61deik,"Ok so I kind of knew I was wrong before I even wrote a this AITA so I ended up writing a text to her but not including it. Anyway this conversation happened:

Me: I really don't want our relationship to end like this. I do admit that I probably should have asked you before I shared the details of our relationship and the things that you shared with just me. That probably felt like a betrayal to you. You were right. My feelings were extremely hurt and I wasn't thinking very clearly. But also I don't think telling me to not talk to you and being petty about it was the right way to go about telling me that you weren't comfortable with what I did either. We both made mistakes. Everything about this situation is messed up, but I do still want to be friends or I at least don't want us to hate each other because we have so many classes together.

61deik,She's telling you to not talk to her and you're violating her wishes. You're being an asshole more and more. Leave her alone. Move on with your life.,Human
61deik,But we do sit at the same tables in a lot of classes.,Human
61deik,"Then send her the following text ""I'm sorry to keep bothering you. I'll leave you alone from now on""

And ask your teachers to move you and explain the situation in very simply terms. ""I was in a relationship with Xgirl and need to be moved to respect her wishes. I would really appreciate you working with me on this.""",Human
61deik,Thanks for your advice.,Human
61deik,"Well, ...that you regret the last text is good. It is pretty brutal, and effectively invalidates your apology.  From here, the only right move is to take a break from talking with each other for a good long while.  

Because you're young, and emotions run hot, here's a tip.  Don't communicate when you're mad.  You have less impulse control when raw emotion is pumping through your body.  You already regret that last text and it was only a little while ago.  If you'd waited days to address it, you would have been able to say the things you wanted to say without letting the desire to be mean creep in.

You've said in your posts that you don't want to hurt her, but it's clear that you do.  You're hurt, and misery loves company, and blame feels good.  The problem is that blame gets in the way of real communication, and it only feels good for a very short time before if makes you feel worse.

Time feels like the enemy because inaction is hard, but time is the answer here.  Leave this situation alone for a while.",Human
61deik,"It just sucks man. I'm over here fucking crying at school like a little bitch and it just seems like she's not affected at all and we were best friends for a long time. You would think she would care, but I guess now that my true colors are coming out, she's glad we're not even friends anymore.",Human
61deik,"She is hurt too.  She is just better at hiding her feelings.  It is easier on her because she is the one who ended the relationship, so it wasn't a shock to her and she had time to warm up to the idea and sort through it before she went through with it.

It is natural for you to have intense feelings after a break-up, and it is natural to be affected when you see her, but you need to find an outlet for those feelings that is appropriate.  The class project wasn't the right place.  Confronting her isn't the right thing.  Do you have a close friend you could confide in (outside of school)?  If not, pop into your school psychologist's office.  That's what they're there for.  It's a safe place to cry, it's confidential, and in addition to being a sounding board, s/he will probably have some very good advice for you.",Human
61deik,"Just as a sort of reason why I said what I said and was so hurt...actually I said it best in the essay...I'll rip it from there.

""Individualization

The last three days of our relationship were absolute torture for me. Remember how I said she would stop waiting for me before college classes. Well, she stopped waiting for me at all. She wouldn’t bother waiting for me in the commons in the morning or at lunch. Whenever I went over to her, she looked annoyed and didn’t talk to me, but instead actively talked to someone else. It felt horrible. On Monday, I expected her to be somewhat happy to see me. No. She seemed constantly annoyed by my presence. She always put her earbuds in when she was around me. Whenever I wanted to say anything, she would laboriously pause her music and look up at me like I was bothering her. Whenever she talked to me, she would do this bizarre smile and laugh that sounded so fake and unnatural that I couldn’t help feeling incredibly uncomfortable. She smiled and laughed with literally everything she said to me. It was so bizarre.

Separation

I can’t describe how horrible it feels to be treated like this by someone you like so much and not know exactly why or if there’s an end in sight. Remember how I said she does this thing where she smiles and shifts her weight when she’s flustered? Well she does literally the same thing when she’s uncomfortable. At the end of the day I gave her a Big Red, which is one of her favorite sodas right behind or maybe even",Human
61deik,"I completely and utterly disagree with you. Discussing your break up will inevitably happen with your closest friends, or with friends who don't know your ex. But to share a document that details every facet of the relationship with 10 people? Come on, that is totally not ok at all and OP is definitely the asshole. Compounding this is the fact that they were best friends, which, along with the fact they're in High School, means that some of those people were probably her friends as well. Even if not, they are still people she has to see every single day.

Of course you are legally able to talk about a relationship when it's over, but most decent human beings would not spread their dirty laundry across their peer group. Freedom of expression does not give you carte Blanche to be an asshole without being named as such.

OP, I strongly recommend you listen to the other posts and not this one. It strikes me as pretty bad advice.",Human
61deik,"It really depends on what you shared but 11 pages sounds like a ton of details... Some people really value their privacy. Overall I feel she's overreacting though, unless you shared anything personal that truly betrayed her trust.",Human
61deik,Yeah you're totally a dick here,Human
61deik,It's an 11 page feelings dump. Her reaction seems pretty measured. ,Human
61deik,I agree but there's nothing I can do about it.,Human
61deik,I agree especially since she does value her privacy a lot and doesn't share much with that many people. I feel bad but there's nothing I can do.,Human
61deik,"Just let this whole thing be over honestly. No reason to keep trying to justify your actions, you were wrong.",Human
61deik,well yeah I know that.,Human
61deik,She strongly dislikes the people I shared it with except for like 2. She never liked my friends.,Human
61deik,Mmm its only the truth from your perspective though. That's the issue. In your other posts you paint her as some woman who was horribly ignoring you and too afraid to just end it. Perhaps she saw the whole relationship a completely different way and by sharing this around you are disming her truth. I would be incredibly pissed in her shoes too.,Human
61deik,"No she confirmed that what I wrote was correct. She wasn't pissed because I was painting her in a bad light or lying about her, but because I shared it with my friends.",Human
61deik,That doesn't make it any better. These are her peers who she has to see every day. How would you feel if she had done this to you?,Human
61deik,"I really can't know unless I'm in the situation but I feel like I would like to read it so that I could know exactly what was going through her mind and when and learn from my mistakes, but now that I'm thinking about it, it would be extremely embarassing and a breach of my trust if she went and shared it with her friends. I did things in the context of our private relationship that were just for her and no one else. I see how it made her feel now, but I really can't do anything about it at this point. Our relationship is beyond repair and I feel like trying to tell her further that I've seen the error of my ways will just put me deeper in a hole, so I won't. I'll just let us both heal. We all make irrational decisions when we're loaded with emotion so she may be able to forgive me down the line.",Human
61deik,"I think apologising and telling her you realise you were in the wrong is the adult thing to do. It won't make you best friends again but it might help her heal, and you.",Human
61deik,"I said ""Ok I truly am sorry that I shared that document with everyone. It was between us and I should've respected that. Sharing that document was a huge invasion of privacy and you were right to be mad. I thought about it and if you did the same thing, I would be mad too because you say things in the context of the relationship you have with the person you're talking to. I took access away from everyone and deleted it. I understand that you don't want to talk to me. I'll leave you alone forever now.""",Human
61deik,"I'm going to agree with the chorus here that you were in the wrong in this situation, but I think there's some mitigating factors that may redirect some of the blame onto other persons. If I'm understanding you correctly, this paper was part of a class assignment where you were told to disclose potentially confidential details of your relationship with another person? If so, I don't think that was really an appropriate topic for your teacher to assign. 

I was told of a situation similar to this by a friend of mine. My friend had to write a paper for a college class where he was required to discuss his relationships with other people and even had to interview these people to get some of their insights. It actually lead to a major fallout with some of his dorm mates and caused long-term injury to his relationship with them. Your instructor probably should be asked not to assign these kinds of topics in the future.",Human
61deik,"No it was more like you put some surface level stuff like one or 2 sentences per subtitle and give them to the teacher. Instead, I wrote a novel and shared it with some of my friends because I thought it was a cool story.",Human
61deik,"Oh, I see. Then it sounds like you majorly over-indulged in disclosing details about your relationship with you ex, way more than what would have been appropriate for the assignment. In that case, I think you share most of the blame. It would have been a little different if your teacher was more or less putting a gun to your head and telling you to discuss this kind of stuff with everyone.",Human
61deik,Well thanks for telling me that.,Human
61deik,"Well done, it takes courage to own your mistakes. hope you guys can find some resolution. ",Human
61deik,"You dated for a month and never even kissed? I find that somewhat odd. But yes you are definitely the asshole. It doesn't matter what your friend Sarah did, that is irrelevant to what you did. You completely violated her privacy and didn't even ask if she was okay with that. Also 11 pages seems like a ridiculous amount for a relationship that only lasted a month and one where you too never had any sexual intimacy. Could you not just have confided in a close friend instead of telling so many people?  ",Human
61deik,It included the time we were best friends and she wanted to take it slow. That's why we didn't kiss.,Human
61deik,Well then how long was the actual dating process?? My original point: 11 pages is way too long especially to share with so many people without even asking her if she was okay with that. I'm sure she sees these people too. Give her some space or you will continue to be the asshole here. Confiding in a close friend is one thing but showing an 11 page paper to that many people is out of line.,Human
61deik,"&gt; The respectable thing is to give the bare minimum to friends about intimate relationship details. 

Or, as someone else mentioned, at least restrict the sordid details and in-depth storytelling to a limited and trustworthy group that limits further reputation damage and fallout.",Human

But I don't think anyone's an asshole here. The guy gave you a free popcorn voucher despite not doing anything wrong. It's not weird that they reacted that way to someone sitting down at a handicapped spot and going back up. Obviously, that's not something one expects from a handicapped person.

No assholes, but I don't at all see why your mother and friend said you should've sat in the handicapped section...

That pretty much sums it all up, doesn't it? You've got to have at least two, and you can't camp the room until someone else shows up. You had two, and they were camping the room. ""First come, first serve"" in this case has a distinct meaning of what ""come"" is, in this case ""come with a group of more than one"", which your rude counterparty did not. They gambled on holding the room until other people showed up, on other people deferring despite the rules, and lost. The fact that they were allowed in the room until you showed up is an indulgence above and beyond a basic ""FCFS, must have group"" concept.

Not the asshole.",Human

Talk more with your SO and the fact that you posted asking for help is an indicator you know you need some help. That's the first step in getting better OP. I'd say get some therapy if you think it'll help.

I honestly don't know if seeing a therapist would help because obviously nobody likes to talk about needing a therapist so it's hard to know if it's something that works. I only see it on TV shows and films which mostly paints it in a bad light.

I think I love her. I think about spending the rest of my life with her and I work hard so we can have a comfortable future.

I also feel like an asshole because I lust after other women as well. I think about sex with other women and feel greedy. I want my cake and eat it too.

Nah man therapists arent like that at all. It's nothing like in TV. Think of them as people who are there to help you untangle the tangled within you. Sometimes you can't really find that thread that will help unravel your tangles and therapists are the people who help you find that thread. 

But don't go rushing into therapy if you yourself don't feel like doing it inside. Take your time. Make sure you feel right.

These thoughts have to be plucked out, one by one, by carefully trained hands. And, the best advice you will get is to see a counsellor.

You'd probably benefit from seeing a therapist on your own to deal with the specific issues you mentioned.  That said, it's an excellent idea for any couple considering marriage to attend couples' counselling for awhile...3-6 months every other week or so is a good bet.  It can help the two of you work through any issues you may be having now, but it can also help you lay the foundation for good communication in the future and ensure you share complementary approaches to achieving mutual goals.

Therapy isn't just for screwed up people.  It's for anyone who needs a sounding board on occasion and anyone who wants a better understanding of him or herself.

As for the timeline, it's up to you.  Just make sure you're clear about your motivation.  Is talking about your relationship really going to be a distraction from her work, or is this project an easy way to justify putting off a topic you're not incredibly comfortable broaching in the first place?  That's something you need to figure out for yourself.",Human
61jsuh,"I agree with your comment here.  There is no need for our sub to get overly sensitive about what amounts to a few threads in the past couple of weeks.  Those threads can simply be flaired ""wrong sub"", and we can all go along our merry way.

I looked at both posts by OP in r/relationships, and found that one was locked for lacking flair, per sub rules, and the other was locked for lacking a TL;DR, per sub rules.

If you are going to marry this woman you definitely need to start seeing a therapist ASAP. Individual to start and then maybe as a couple. These are issues you need to work out before you get married, otherwise you'll probably end up resenting your fiancé after awhile. In your post you really didn't say whether or not she knows how you feel about this. If she doesn't, I think it might be a good idea to wait until you've had some therapy sessions before you bring it up to her. (And if you're on the fence about therapy in general I can tell you it really does help. Its not a magic bullet and it takes time and it takes a lot work but its worth it.)

Every couple needs personal space. Every couple also needs to have hobbies and interests that are their own and don't involve their partner. Nobody should have to worry or feel guilty about doing things that don't involve their partner. Being able to spend time apart makes the time you spend together more special and enjoyable.

61jsuh,Thank you. I am honetly touched by how much people care enough to reply to my post.,Human
61jsuh,"Exactly. There is one thing I am really concerned about is resentment from either side developing one day.

She does know. At least I don’t think she knows to this extent. I’ve let a few things slip before. She knows that I’m pretty clingy, I’ve admitted that to her before and she says it’s ok.

I’ve also told her that she should always be honest with me and she shouldn’t let me hold her back from doing anything that makes her happy because I don’t want her to one day resent me.

Maybe you’re onto something. I’ve never been like this before. I used to have hobbies but I’ve given them all up to spend time on our financial goals and also because I’ve embraced the frugal lifestyle.

I think I’ve basically decided to seek therapy. The funny thing is cost is the thin that’s holding me back. I am very cash poor at the moment.

61jsuh,Thanks again for posting your experience. I'm going to do a reply to update the thread.,Human
61jsuh,"Update:
Thank you to everyone who has contributed thus far. I am truly touched and surprised (must have had bad experience with other forums) people have taken time out of their day to offer me kind and thoughtful advice.

I truly appreciate it. Your replies allowed me another revelation. Maybe it’s also because I don’t have any friends. I basically stopped making any new friends since I started dating my SO and while I have some friends, I don’t have any friends close enough to talk about these kinds of things. My closet friend lives in another state and he has some wild thoughts about women (PUA). It was great when it felt like me and my SO against the world (I mean not in an aggressive siege mentality way) and all we need is each other.

I have decided to seek therapy and talk to my SO about it after our current project is completed. Maybe it’s not really because I don’t want her distracted but while I have this emotional issue, I am also keeping an eye on our finances and I’m worried that any fallout from the discussion would ruin us both financially.

Got to go back to working but I will keep replying if people are still interested. 
",Human
61jsuh,"Thanks for the advice. Reading your comment has also allowed me to be bit more honest with myself. The true motivation is not to avoid the subject but while I am an emotional being, I am also cognizant of our financial situation as well. I don't want any potential emotional baggage to ruin our financial situation. That would just compound problems.",Human
61jsuh,"No, but you will be an asshole if you dont seek professional help. A therapist will be able to help.",Human
61jsuh,"The resentment definitely sucks and it sneaks up on you. Right now you say you've given up your hobbies to spend time on your financial goals and frugality. If you keep going like you are in a few years you might feel angry that you gave so much up and it will be super easy to direct that anger at your fiancé.

Do you have health insurance? If you do it should cover weekly therapy. Start with your primary care doc, get a health work up, makes sure you're not running low on Vitamin D (which does impact your moods more than you'd think) or anything else. Ask your doc for a referral to a therapist and mention your cash situation. They should be able to help you find a therapist in your network (and possibly one with lower rates) and also one that maybe specializes in or has a professional focus on the issues you want to work on (say, men's mental health or relationship counseling). That will probably be a lot more effective than picking a name out of the phonebook.",Human
61jsuh,"I don't know but I can relate. I feel the same every day. I don't know if I'll ever stop feeling like my fiancé settled for me, and worrying that someday he'll wake up and realize it. I feel like I'm constantly picking fights and self-sabotaging, and he's wonderful and the only thing we ever fight about is me overreacting to petty crap like your wedding situation and worrying ""Well this is it... I suppose he doesn't really like me after all."" And it comes across as if my standards and expectations are unreasonably high. Or I'm constantly playing the victim, as he says. But I really just can't believe he would ever want to be with me. After all my worrying and insecurity and overreacting, ironically I think he's starting to dislike me. I don't know what to do. Everyone says ""oh just go to therapy and find a hobby!!!"" as if that's the fucking secret to creating self esteem when it's literally non existent and you sabotage every good thing in life.

61jsuh,"I hope that I don't direct the resentment at her one day. I don't feel that way at all. In fact giving up on hobbies were self-imposed by me. Technically it's the responsible thing to do. At least at the moment, any hobbies would be spending more than what is sustainable. I don't know how others of my age group does it.

I have been low on Vit D many times actually. I still have a bottle of supplements from the last time I was low.

Thank you for that last suggestion, I had completely forgot that I can go through a doc. Is it wrong of me to feel embarrassed?

My fiancee and I go to the same doc and I see him around our building all the time. The downside of having a rapport with your doc is that I tend to avoid seeking help for ""embarrassing"" ailments.",Human

61jsuh,"Nah, its not wrong to feel embarrassed. Especially if its not something you have any experience with.

Think of it this way - you're basically being that guy who sleeps with a woman and never calls again, just on an emotional (and perhaps platonic, depending on what these girls mean by 'like') level rather than a physical one. Definitely a dick move.

It's like lighting up a cigarette while you're quitting smoking - it feels like it provides some relief, but you're actually making it harder for yourself.

Maybe he wanted to take time to think about what he wanted to say. You'll never know because you blocked him.

61u8b6,"I agree with everyone else, John is definitely the arsehole in this situation.

I do want to play devil's advocate though...

When he said that he was there for you through all this shit in your childhood, it obviously feels to you like he wasn't really, not at an emotional level. What if that was what he was trying for? Like, he may have assumed that you had people to talk to and that he would be the guy you could call to just get away from everything and get your mind off things. Teens especially can have a difficult time figuring out how to deal with highly emotional experiences and he may have felt like he didn't know how to be there for you at that level.

As for why he's taken a side in this whole situation (which definitely makes me lean towards the conclusion that he's the arsehole), maybe he's still in contact with people that know your mother and is getting her side of the story.

I think that if you want to salvage your friendship, ask him why he's taken her side. After he's explained, you can counter anything that isn't truthful (like if he's heard that you were completely irrationally terrible to her, you could explain the situation and let him know that what you were doing was what was best and healthiest for you). Hopefully with open communication you can patch things up.

Otherwise, if you don't want to be friends with him anymore, just go on with your life. He can be petty and post vague comments on facebook if he wants. His facebook friends probably all roll",Human

Normally, I would say that the stay at home partner is responsible for the chores, since that's a way to make things more equal. However, what you said about the dishes really speaks to this problem. Your boyfriend likes a tidy and clean house, and you are a massive slob. If you were leaving the dishes in the sink for a night, and then washing them up before work the next morning, that's one thing, and I would say that your boyfriend needs to calm down. However, you are leaving the dishes in the sink for multiple days at a time (potentially up to all 5 work days, as per your post).

You guys definitely need to communicate and come up with an agreement about housework so this argument won't rear its ugly head in the future.

I'm very fortunate in that when my SO and I have disagreements we always come out the other side with a better understanding of eachother's expectations and feelings.  

People live in all sorts of conditions.  The dishes out for a day or two, while less than ideal isn't the worst thing ever. If she was serious that she would leave them all week, then that is a problem, but it doesn't make her an arsehole, just someone with low standards.

I've been OP. I've been OPs partner.

If he can't just put up with making things the way he likes them, and gentle course correction (""oh hey, I did a ton of dishes earlier, mind if you tackle those now, so the sink is empty a little longer?"" ) that's on him for letting it build this long and also not being able to let go of it.",Human

He does the chores. end of story. everybody has to find a role in a household where they're useful, or else they're just a child. he can get a job and share the bills if he wants to share responsibilities. ",Human
621p5y,"Other perspective checking in. I stay at home, and my SO works a hard job. I am the clean one in the relationship and hate messes. However, SO and I and I have gotten into fights because I often don't want his help cleaning because I just want him to able to relax before he has to go back to work early the next morning. The way he sees it, I am insulting him by not letting him contribute to the home in a literal manner. I have a hard time trying to accomidate him, because the way I see it, I am the one disrespecting him if I let him clean.

He comes from a home where work and home responsibilities were treated equally, and everyone had to contibute to chores no matter what. My mother worked and went to school to get a better job. My father did all of the household chores and take care of me while keeping his at-the-time less important job. So for my SO it's an obligation, and for me it's practicality. 

However, even though he wanted to help, I was frustrated with the way he could never consistently provide help, or when I did ask him to help with something, he would say ""Okay, after I'm done with this"" and then 4 hours would pass. I didn't expect it to be done immediately, but I hated feeling like a nagging mother, so much so that it was just easier to for me to give up and do the task myself. Then HE would get mad about that, yadayada.
We eventually came to a compromise where he takes care of not so frequent chores, and I do the daily upkeep, so that we are both happy.

Obviously you're at least a little resentful that he is playing games all day instead of working (legitimate), and he is resentful that he has to clean up after you all the time (also legitimate). Both of you need to express this to each other in a way that isn't just a screaming fest. 

Then you need to compromise. Maybe there is a habit you have that is making doing the house work particularly taxing - I know that I have a tendency to leave clothes on the bathroom floor, and my girlfriend has a habit of putting her plate in the sink without scraping it (I do dishes and hate this).

That stuff comes up a million times over the course of a relationship. It's all about how you express it and work it out.

The last moments of someone's life are not the time to cling to how right you think you are about something.  You could have given her comfort in the last moments of her life and instead you chose a cold-hearted ""face-the-truth"" approach.  It was a time for generosity.",Human
626zo2,"That last line makes this painful to answer, but yes. That moment wasn't about you, it was about giving her some comfort in her final moments. You lose nothing by doing it. You don't lose self-respect since you know it's about your mom and not an actual act of faith.",Human
626zo2,"No, other people shouldn't be able to dictate your beliefs (or actions derived from them), even on their deathbed. You could have done what she wanted, but you have no obligation to. Both choices are consistent with being a good person and not an asshole.",Human
626zo2,"By you asking if you're an asshole, I think you already know the answer.

You had the opportunity to give her some comfort in her last moments, even if it's not something you believe in. I can't imagine the fear of being on your deathbed without knowing what happens next. Even if there is nothing as you believe, just the thought of moving on into an afterlife will give them some comfort. 

The best way to compare it is when your young child believes there is a monster under the bed. We all know as adults there is nothing there,  but instead of telling them their fears are silly we still look and ""scare"" the monsters away. It allows them to go to bed without fear.

You allowed her in her last moments to question her faith and possibly made her scared to go instead of peacefully. I'm sorry for your loss, but you are truly an asshole.

For example--not that this accurately reflects OP's situation--a controlling mother on her deathbed could have forced her child to attend church against their wishes until the child moved out; they suffered harm as a result and want to establish a clear boundary in their relationship with their mother. They would be perfectly justified in maintaining this boundary and refusing to let their mother control them again.",Human

626zo2,"I do understand your thought process.  I went though a similar one 20 years ago, when as an atheist I married the son of a minister and a life-long missionary.  Planning our wedding was a lesson in the fine line between standing on principle and bending in deference to those we love.  It was very important to my husband to have his father marry us.  Watching his father marry people was part of the fabric of his childhood, and though he didn't subscribe to the doctrine of his father's church, he very much wanted that ritual as he had seen it throughout his life.  I, on the other hand, did not want God mentioned in a ceremony about my promising my self to another person for the rest of my life.  It felt like starting our lives together in a lie.  It caused great upheaval in our relationship, and although we worked through it, it was a very interesting turn of events because my opinions about that moment have continually changed over time and with the benefit of life experience.

I've come to learn that ""bending in deference to those we love"" (as I phrased it earlier) is not about bending your *beliefs*, it is about bending your perception of how important those beliefs are to a given moment.  Put simply, I have learned that it is more important to be kind than to be right in most instances.

That is a difficult lesson, and one that requires practice on my part because I dearly love to be right. :P

Bringing it back to your case, I think it was possible for you to ""stand by your",Human
626zo2,"Look, you're asking whether in this particular situation you were the asshole. The unfortunate answer is yes. Because she was dying and you refused an action that would bring her happiness and comfort at a dark time.

 She wasn't asking you to renounce your atheism or to take communion. You could have just bowed your head and taken her hand at that moment when she needed you. Was she asking you to pray out loud by the way? Or just for an amen at the end of her prayer?

The way I see it as an atheist too is that to me they are just words but to others they are important. I think to deny her that moment was selfish. I'm assuming you weren't in front of an audience at the time? 

I'm an atheist myself but I don't see a moment like that as a betrayal of my own beliefs, I see it as reaching out to someone in need.

626zo2,"Oh, sure.

My husband felt that since the words being said held no meaning to me, I should be able to simply hear them and let them go by without attaching meaning.  I, on the other hand, felt that they did have meaning and that by allowing them to be a part of our ceremony was effectively condoning the religion and presenting myself as Christian.

We tried for a compromise.  I asked my father-in-law if he would consider doing the ceremony without mentioning God.  He would not.  He was willing to step aside if we wanted to go with another person to perform the vows, but he couldn't in good conscience do it any differently from how he always did.

My husband and I discussed it.  A lot.  We argued.  We each reiterated our own perspective on the matter over and over.  It was one of those situations where the two people in a couple hold opposite opinions.  Like when one wants a baby, and the other doesn't.  You can't have half a baby.

Ultimately, I could see how important this was to him.  Not in a religious sense, but as a bonding moment with his father.  It was something he'd always assumed would be, and he felt the carpet being pulled out from under him.  So, I gave in.  It was the one detail in the planning of our wedding that he really cared about, and it felt selfish do deny it to him.  It felt like something he would probably carry forward as a regret and a potential resentment, and that didn't seem a good way to start a marriage either.

So, I bent my thinking.  I would ",Human

626zo2,"Let's imagine your mother was literally retarded. Extremely mentally impaired. And she was dying. And her whole life she believed in an imaginary magical bunny and thought she would finally live with this magical bunny forever once she died, and that gave her extreme comfort.

Maybe, just maybe, to comfort her and ease her pain, you could just pretend that this magical bunny was alive and assure her she would go live with him. Not because you believe in the magical bunny (obviously, that's crazy!), but because your mom has just moments left on earth and you don't want her to spend them in mental anguish with you denying her magical bunny existed and arguing that she would never see him again.

Now replace bunny with God.

I'm all for sticking up for your beliefs, but if not sticking up for them for a brief lapse in time wouldn't harm anyone at all and there would be no consequences and would actually HELP someone by not sticking up for them, yet you do it anyways, what does that really say about your character?",Human

I don't envy carrying that weight. 

Look man, sure, you stood up for what you believe in, but you should pick your battles. She wasn't making you convert, and even if she did, so what? You don't believe in it anyway. You could have said whatever she wanted to hear so she went out happy. 

Instead you showed her that she wasn't as important to you as your own selfish pride. 

If you really were going to stick with your beliefs, if you really don't think there's a god and praying doesn't do anything, then objectively, you only had to mutter words that you didn't believe in to make your mother happy before she died. Just moved the air around with your mouth. 

If your beliefs can't bring happiness to other people then what's the point? If your beliefs are harming yourself and others, why are you keeping them? 

So, while I am so sorry for your loss, yes, you were an asshole. A prideful, arrogant asshole who cares more for your atheist track record than your mother.

I'm sorry that I'm writing this in such a blunt fashion, but there is a reason for it. 

You need to come to grips with how utterly self absorbed and hurtful this is, and you need to remember it, because not only will this situation happen again someday, and not only will learning to be more compassionate and less prideful help you with similar situations, but because you, personally, will die someday.

My personal experience overlaps somewhat with yours, though not entirely.  My husband grew up speaking exclusively German with his father and English with his mother.  I spoke no German when I met him.  His conversations with his father (and sometimes his mother if it's a group discussion) are ALWAYS in German, despite the fact that my FIL is perfectly fluent in English.  Early on, I simply didn't understand.  As with you, in the very early part of our relationship, the family would take pains to translate for me.  FIL would speak in German, when explain in English for my benefit.  Or someone else would.  Eventually, that just petered out, because it's a lot of work.

It would have been unnatural for them to suddenly change everything about the way that they had been communicating for 20 years just because I showed up on the scene, and it would have been incredibly insecure of me to make the request.

Over the years, I learned some German just through its growing presence in my life.  When we had a child, I insisted that my husband speak to our kids only in German so that they would be bilingual by default.  It is one of the easiest and best gifts we could have given.

Is it petty? Yes. Is it hilarious? Also yes. Does it work? Yes. You've already brought it up, which means you've gone as far as maturity requires. She's beyond that now, so-too can you be.

OP, trust me. I've used this exact method, and it works. Rude people are rude because they get away with it. Native language and culture have nothing to do with it - especially when they've been clearly informed of the harmfulness of their behavior. You've got to bring her shittiness home to her. ",Human
62gl2e,"You're the asshole. If you're in someone else's house and they want to speak Spanish, that's their prerogative. You can't just proclaim that everywhere you go Spanish speaking people need to shut up or speak English in your presence. 

Does she demand that you speak Spanish in your home when she visits?  Probably not. 

I think it's very nice of her to speak English for your benefit when she chooses to do so, but it's not your prerogative to dictate what other people say, or what language they say it in. ",Human
62gl2e,"No, she sounds petty in this situation and the incredibly red flagged situation you mentioned:

62h57y,"For what?

I think you're asking if you're the asshole for being irritated with her behavior because the behavior itself is/could be the outcome of her condition.  Is that right?

Answer: no.  

You'd be the asshole if you went out of your way to make conditions difficult for her, like if you were to blast music when she needs to sleep those extra hours.  But simply noticing that she's irritating (regardless the cause) does not make you the asshole.

Also, being manipulative or passive-aggressive seems like a personality trait of her, and not a symptom of her condition, so you're doubly off the hook on that one.",Human
62h57y,"Not the asshole.

62h57y,"&gt; Additionally, IMO she's quite manipulative, saying things like ""I can leave any time you want"" or ""you don't have to help me if it's inconvenient"", knowing full well how much of an asshole I would at the very least feel like if I were to turn her down. 

I checked webMD and wikipedia, but they didn't list ""passive aggressive, martyr complex"" as symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.

Well put. The only mental health issue that is co-morbid with ME/CFS/SEIDS is reactive depression. We have a higher suicide rate than the general population.

What this means in practice is that we are encouraged to stay on top of things and get mental health support, and being a passive aggressive martyr is the kind of thing her therapist would be telling her to avoid!",Human
62h57y,"You're not an asshole. I want to reply to this as someone who has been diagnosed by a neurologist as having this condition. 

The sleeping is something she genuinely can't help. Her body is unable to go through sleep phases properly and she doesn't have proper energy release into her muscles. She may also have narrowing of the arteries and problems with her heart valve. This is why she can't do much. It's very frightening and then very disappointing to get this illness.

The social ineptitude is partly from her condition, sure, she probably lost a lot of friends and doesn't have much of a life. On the other hand it's also perfectly natural and normal to feel irritation when dealing with socially inept people like us! Don't feel bad about it.

She has also lost pretty much all her power in life, so it's not surprising she is trying to assert herself in an attempt to feel included. She should try harder not to annoy you, though, and maybe you should let her know when she is.

The manipulation part, that's 100% on her, and I think it's a very stupid thing to do on her part. Manipulation is a took of the weak, sure, and she is weak, but when you have an ""invisible"" illness like we do, honesty and sincerity is really, really important in dealing with others. She's being an asshole by doing that.

Next time she says something like """"you don't have to help me if it's inconvenient"" maybe you could try saying something like, ""I realize you feel powerless right now, and I also realize ",Human

62juuv,"Not at all. 
You just listed all the reasonable reasons why you want your own children. 
I hear the same arguments made for adopting pets and making the same arguments for humans doesn't hold the same logic. ",Human
62juuv,"No. Not at all. My daughter has my fathers bright blue eyes, and she's the perfect blending of mine and my husband's features and it's amazing to see. It's an amazing experience to be pregnant and give birth and breastfeed. There is nothing at all wrong with wanting that for yourself",Human
62juuv,"You're not the asshole. This can be a highly personal and complex issue. Few issues about having children are black-and-white. For example, adoption can be a costly, lengthy, and difficult process for some. It's not as simple as just immediately taking in someone in need. 

Anyone raising children does need to care for them properly, but otherwise I don't think it's appropriate to shame individuals for their decisions to have or not to have children. That's where I make the distinction. It's okay to argue, for example, that in general people should have fewer children due to the rate of resource consumption. Conversely, it is rude to go after an individual for having a child they love and provide for. Having biological children isn't inherently narcissistic and it's not inherently wrong to do something for your own pleasure anyway. ",Human
62juuv,"Good grief, that's some ""friend"" you've got there! 

She is, of course, entitled to make her own decisions about whether or not to have biological and/or adopted children, but she's the asshole for making a stupid judgmental post like that!

And I say this as a person who is both adopted and child free!",Human
62juuv,"No, you are not the arsehole.  I think your friend voiced her position in a very arseholeish way.   I personally want to be, and am child-free, but that is a very personal decision.  To have or not to have children must always be the personal decision of the possible parent.

The fact is that there isn't a lot of unwanted children in the developed world.  The developing nations are rightly very suspicious and anxious about adopting their unparented children overseas.  There are too many criminals who have 'adopted' children then exploited them.  So the process is protracted and difficult, and entirely moot if what you want is 'your own' biological child.",Human
62juuv,"&gt; she's the asshole for making a stupid judgmental post like that

I would disagree since it's not like the friend was commenting on OP's post, just posting their own valid opinion on their own page. ",Human
62juuv,"&gt; A childfree facebook friend posted a status about how it's narcissistic to have bio children while the world is already too full and millions of kids go unadopted every day. 

So your friend volunteers other people to adopt, but won't do it theirself.  Adoption is expensive and a long process.       
In the US, most kids who have trouble being adopted are older kids (there are tons of people who want to adopt babies) who often have emotional problems from growing up in terrible conditions. Not everyone is capable of taking care of these kids.          
Around the world adoption is regulated by other countries who set limitations on who can adopt and how many people can adopt (internationally) per year. international adoption rates have declined due to increased regulations and limitations imposed by other countries. People are waiting years to adopt. Adding to the queue doesn't solve the problem.            
Your friend is a self righteous hypocrite who doesn't know what they're talking about.",Human
62juuv,"No, someone else is the asshole for having them when they couldn't or wouldn't take care of them.",Human
62juuv,"No, not at all. I don't even want kids and I don't think you're an asshole. It's that mentality why I avoid childfree people, which is fucking absurd.",Human
62juuv,"No, god, why the fuck are so many people in the ""childfree"" community like this? Procreation is (I supposed arguably) the single most fundamental biological urge. It's literally the most normal choice anyone makes. It's a cool part of being the sapien species that we have both the vast wealth of information to make decisions around procreation as an option, and the tools and social structure to make that choice. It doesn't make us morally or intellectually superior for doing so. 

I don't want kids. There's plenty of perfectly good reasons why. I don't need to lean into people who make a different choice to validate my own. The worst part is these people usually bitch endlessly about getting mocked, insulted or harassed over their choice and then go say shit like this. ",Human
62juuv,"Not the asshole. I am childfree, but I will not begrudge someone else for wanting and having kids. That's all you fam. As long as you raise your children well and take care of them, have the family you want. 
",Human
62juuv,"&gt; A childfree facebook friend posted a status about how it's narcissistic to have bio children while the world is already too full and millions of kids go unadopted every day.

Oooh, that's a shitty argument as it opens one to questions about one's selfishness in remaining child-free if the crisis of unadopted children is so dire. 

Your friend's both an asshole and an idiot. ",Human
62juuv,"Not the asshole. My wife and I are personally childless, and we're looking at fostering or mentoring in the future rather than having our own for context.  

The decision to have your own child is to a point, narcissistic yes. You're making life for your own enjoyment, no way to get around that. However, if you can offer that child a healthy, secure life who am I to complain? It's your body, your money, none of my beeswax.

If you have six kids? Then yeah, I think maybe you could have looked at adopting a few instead. But this is just one child. If that friend really wanted to help reduce the worlds population, she could find plenty of better ways to do so than complain on facebook. ",Human
62juuv,"No. Adoption isn't for everyone. It can be lengthy and expensive and the children can come out of it quite damaged. My sister is adopting. It should have been easy because it is thr baby of death relatives. Nope. A realitivr with no standing has made her life hell and held the courts up. It has been months of harassment, people in and out of her house, expensive lawyer bills. I am so glad that I was able to have my own kids. I don't have to live in fear of people trying to claim them and take me to court over anything and everything.",Human
62juuv,You are not the asshole. Your friend is ignorant. Check out /r/adoption and you will hear about how they hate the simplistic statement that there are so many kids just waiting to be adopted. ,Human
62juuv,Not the asshole at all your friend is. I am adopted and I don't feel any pressure to pay it forward by adopting a child when I am ready to have one. Just because someone else had unprotected sex and produced a child they are not willing or able to care for you shouldn't be able to make your own life choices? Total bullshit and I would tell that friend to adopt a child or multiple children if she feels so strongly about it. ,Human
62juuv,"No, you're not. Tell your 'friend' that if she can payroll the adoption and its associated costs (from what I hear, it's very expensive to organise an adoption), you're happy to adopt your next child.


Your 'friend' is a massive arsehole.",Human
62juuv,"&gt;A childfree facebook friend...millions of kids go unadopted every day.

If she's so concerned about those children, she should give up her child-free status and adopt one herself. 
&gt; me having my own beautiful son and there being children to adopt are unrelated issues. 

You are correct. 

",Human
62juuv,"I agree what this person posted is assholish, but something being a biological urge doesn't make it right. people can do what they want but there's no denying that to some extent it is narcissistic. any reason someone gives for having a child begins with ""I wanted..."" but the adoption stuff is bullshit, if someone wants a kid they do indeed have that human right. ",Human
62juuv,"this is why abortion should not simply be legal but universally accessible. people who have unprotected sex made a dumb mistake, but those who then object to having an abortion are the real assholes. if its a burden on your conscience too bad, you can't create a whole life due to your mistake. too bad this could never be the political mainstream but it's the truly ethical solution to OPs ""friends"" problem. sorry for derailing almost completely from your point.

I also think it's totally fair to say something, but in my experience it usually works better to target the result. I.e. tell him it really ruins your fun when he's a dick because he's tired. Tell him you're not trying to nag and encourage him to have fun with his games, but that you would really appreciate it if he could make an effort tomorrow to not like it affect the mood. Then it's his decision to go to bed or not, and you can say things like ""hey, remember what we talked about last night?"" if he's snippy tomorrow. Presumably he loves you and doesn't want to shit on your good mood.",Human

You address it when it happens. if he doesn't deal with it, you address it when it happens again. And if it keeps happening, you decide if being with him is worth him taking out his completely preventable crankiness on you.

When you have to talk about being lenient with an SO, it generally means that you have to act in some kind of guidance/supervisory role with him.
Maybe you're more of his 'mother' in this situation than his SO.
 You describe him as being 'cranky' as well when he has to do anything else besides the next day.
Honestly, you have been really good in letting him do what he enjoys without nagging, and even facilitating him but he needs to grow up. Everyone loves doing their hobby but everything in moderation.

Have a heart to heart with him and let him know that he needs to exhibit some self control because it is impacting your relationship.

Do you think that someone claiming depression for attention is normal?     Someone doing anything like that - depression, cancer, abuse - just for attention - has mental problems.   

What difference does it make if the mental problems are legitimately depression, or something else?  

If this person is your friend, don't call them out publicly.  speak to them as a friend, and encourage them to get help.  See a counselor, a doctor, a priest/rabbi, whatever.   encourage them to get help. 
If he isn't your friend, at least be decent and tell them to get some help in another way.

OP, if you actually want to help in a compassionate way you can do some basic on research on depression so you understand what it entails, avoid denying he has depression or making other minimizing comments (e.g. ""just be positive!""), encourage him to seek help or even offer to do some basic research on treatment option together, and/or make an effort to be a friend in general (be kind, ask him how he is, let him know you support him, etc.).

If someone says they have some sort of problem and you took it's too get attention, just tell them to get help from a professional and take it seriously, it doesn't cost you anything, they're not asking for your money, they want your attention. 

It's a burden on your own mental health to have to deal with people who really annoy you and seek you out for attention, so always suggest professional help, but you can distance yourself from them.  ",Human
62p23v,"Yes you are the asshole, stop taking it personally that he isn't following your advice, you seem mad at him because you think you have the easy solution and your friend just won't do it. Depression doesn't work as easily as that. It would do you some good to learn a bit more about it and learn how to be an understanding helpful person by telling him you are there if he needs someone but you understand if what he needs is to be alone. Suggest therapy and stop pushing the matter. You are not the one who is going to fix this.

You are also the asshole for starting your entire question by stating that this person is not really your friend just someone you tolerate. But that could just be your age/immaturity showing. Don't be that way. Be friends with someone or don't. Your faking a friendship or 'tolerating' someone is not something that any other person needs from you. ",Human
62p23v,"Yep, you're an asshole. Depression affects everyone differently, and it isn't just someone acting sad all the time. Check out the symptoms for clinical depression in the DSM-V and you'll see symptoms that are quite opposite of each other. ",Human
62p23v,"You also need to be aware that at 14 years old it can be really hard to get to the doctors by yourself. Especially if you don't want your parents to know that you are struggling or if your parents are very unsupportive.

That's a generous thing to do and I admire you for it.  If he IS depressed, then simply providing company is the best and most you can do for him.

I have a lot of experience with people with mental/emotional illnesses.  They often have very severe mental blocks that prevent them from seeking the professional help they need for a long time.

I suggest once, and once only, gently asking him if he has someone that can take him to get a professional diagnosis.   If not his parents another relative?  A family friend?

Also, take care of yourself first.  If Kieran's company eventually starts getting you really down, stressed, or irritated, then gently disentangle yourself from his company.",Human

That's exactly what depression is like. Knowing that something is wrong with you, but being unable to do something about it.",Human
62p23v,"Sorry, you're the asshole.  Your friend is making a serious claim which should be treated as such.  If he's just seeking attention then maybe he'll change his tactics when he learns that his plan has serious ramifications.  If he's actually depressed then he needs help to manage and learn to cope with his condition.",Human
62p23v,"Absolutely. 

Depression isn't about being sad. It's not about being happy.  It's much deeper than that, and you obviously do not understand how complicated depression can be. You are young, and naive.  But, most importantly, you're an asshole.

You have some growing up to do.

62p7ky,"Somewhat. Are you saying this to her? It's generally asshole-ish to give unsolicited criticisms of people's weight (or predicted weight). It's also not her responsibility to help you diet. She's a child, not a dietitian. While I know it can be challenging to stick to a diet when the household is filled with unhealthy food, you can speak to your parents about buying more healthy options, if they do the shopping, or make those decisions for yourself if you do the shopping.

Concern about her health is understandable and this can be a tricky topic to navigate. But I'd think there's a good chance your sister isn't entirely unaware that ice cream is unhealthy and managing her health is really up to her, her doctor, and her parents (while she's a minor). She's still a tween and this may or may not lead to long-term health problems, but you can lead by example in by eating healthfully and having an active lifestyle. If you feel the need to say something, expressing concern about her unhealthy diet with your parents is probably going to be a better option than saying to your sister ""you'll get fat if you eat all that ice cream.""",Human
62p7ky,"A massive one, if you actually said it. 

&gt;I am also concerned about her health.

You very well might be, but I don't really believe that is the reason you're so motivated to stop her eating ice cream and I am not entirely sure she will either.",Human
62p7ky,"If you said that to her, then yes, you are TA. This is something you should let your parents handle. Your diet has nothing to do with her. Yes, she needs to learn not to eat ice cream in excess, but telling her she's going to get fat isn't the best way to address it. My sister used to pick on me during my chubby tween phase and that kind of thing sticks with you. I found out years later that she was unhappy with her own weight, which was part of why she was picking on me. ",Human
62p7ky,"Yes. You are responsible for your behavior and she's responsible for hers. If she chooses to eat ice cream, that's her choice, not yours. She gets the bear the consequences of her choices, ie to eat ice cream. You bear the consequences of yours, ie diminished relationship with your sister from you trying to control her behavior.",Human
62p7ky,"If it is because you are concerned about her health, then it depends on the delivery. If you just say ""you're going to get fat"" every time she is eating ice cream, then she might eat more to spite you. 

If you say it because you're displacing your feelings/or just grumpy due to low blood sugar from dieting, then you're a massive asshole. Do you tell every person eating something you can't have that they're going to get fat? ",Human
62p7ky,"Good point. It's often used as justification for criticizing someone's weight, when it's not really the problem. ""You're fat/getting fat"" isn't the language you'd use if that were the case and it's clearly not entirely the reason here given that OP thinks it's impacting their diet. ",Human
62p7ky,"Yeah, you kind of are. You're being dishonest/passive aggressive about not wanting her to eat it in front of you. Just tell her the truth about how you feel, and go elsewhere while she eats it, if it really bothers you.

Meanwhile if you're genuinely worried about her health then take it up with your parents so that as a family you can take steps to educate her about nutrition instead of simply telling her what to do.",Human
62p7ky,"You're a massive asshole if you tell your sibling that they'll get fat if they continue eating as they have been? Well shit I've told my sister she'd get fat doing things before.

There are essentially no circumstances in which it's OK to skip your SO's parent's funeral. Unless you're a very very very new couple.

That makes them good or bad. For instance, you take the word ""Nigger."" There is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ""Nigger"" in and of itself. It's the racist asshole who's using it that you ought to be concerned about. We don't mind when Richard Pryer or Eddie Murphy say it. Why? Because we know they're not racist."" He goes on to say: ""Why, because their niggers."" Yet no one minds that he just called Richard Pryer and Eddie Murphy niggers. Why? Because they know that he has no ill will toward them. He committed probably one of THE biggest taboos in modern society, yet no one had any problem with it because they know the feeling was not there. If he used the word nigger with a racist feeling, he would be come a pariah. I've never seen this point illustrated so perfectly anywhere else. 

RIP George, you brilliant motherfucker. ",Human
3v5a50,"The intention behind the word is part of what makes it offensive, but there's also hundreds of years of slavery and oppression that's behind that word. Saying ""I'm allowed to say nigger because deep down I'm not a racist"" is ridiculous and hugely ignorant. The reason that people weren't angry at Carlin is because he was George Carlin. That sort of thing was part of his character and act. He was a controversial comedian. Take a random, non-racist white guy and get him to call black people niggers in front of a huge crowd and the reaction will likely be different.",Human
3v5a50,"You're basically arguing for thought crime in this post.  People can think what they want, I'll make my personal judgements based on their actions.  The racist example is a good one.  If you believe someone is beneath you because of the color of their skin, then that makes you ignorant and stupid.  It's when you take action on this belief by calling people slurs, forcing them to use separate water fountains or killing them because you're a cop and they were driving while black etc etc, then you become an asshole.  An ignorant, stupid, asshole.  If you do nothing about it and keep your mouth shut, you're just ignorant and stupid.",Human
3v5a50,"While your thoughts can be assholeish or not, like you outlined in your post, that's not how I approach calling someone an asshole or not. Each situation is unique, and as such needs to be viewed individually, while still taking into account the general understanding of the world. 

If the OP question is ""AITA I think my friend is a whore and I don't want to associate with him,"" then yes, that is both asshole thought and action in one, making the person an asshole. However, if the OP is ""AITA I think my friend is a whore,"" yet they don't act on it and let their friend go about their life, then that is asshole thought but not action. So in terms of the situation, they would not be an asshole because they are internalizing their assholeish attitude and not letting it affect anyone involved.

Basically what I'm countering with is that asshole thoughts without asshole actions are different than asshole thoughts combined with asshole actions. Due to that, each situation needs to be carefully looked at and judged independently. My advice is to not use blanket statements when judging, for either interpretation. But you pointed out a really important issue here.",Human
3v5a50,"I think everything you said here is right, but in your example which involves only thought, I would consider the possibility that just thinking someone you treat as a friend is a whore should be examined.  

Suppose the potential whore friend hacked that person's account and discovered the post about her friend's secret thoughts.  Surely, the potential whore would be hurt and angry at the OP for being so judgmental and critical in her *thinking*.   Surely, she would have the right to feel that OP is at least disingenuous to let her believe she was a friend in good standing when she actually had feelings like that.  Perhaps you'd say that this constitutes an action, but I think the offense is indulging the thoughts/feelings.  I think we'd be comfortable calling OP the asshole, then.   Wouldn't she be just as much of an asshole, even if she weren't hacked?",Human
3v5a50,"Even that isn't black and white. A person can choose not to associate with a person because they don't agree with their lifestyle. The person can be an asshole, but not always. For example, your friend sleep around and you don't like it because you are roommates and are not comfortable with lots of strangers coming and going all the time. It is a lot different then thinking less of someone for leading a different lifestyle.",Human
3v5a50,"But that's the key right there. The crowd doesn't know what that white person meant by what he said (thus the context is missing, unlike the above example) and either they will assume he is racist or that he believes he can fit in with a group of people by using their slang. He may be misguided in his judgement of the situation but from an objective stand point, he is not a racist asshole unless he really is a racist asshole. 

Also, side note, even if he was a racist asshole, he would/should still be allowed to say ""nigger"" because communication is the nicest way to solve conflict and telling people they can't speak there mind whether or not they are wrong does not make for good communication. Plus, ultimately if you tell people they can't say a word they just end up replacing it with a new one anyways.",Human
3v5a50,"Everyone thinks bad things, and everyone has prejudices. Such things are irrelevant, as they have no effect on reality.

How you treat people and what you do is the measure upon how you are judged. Thoughts and feelings are entirely immaterial and as such, not subject to scrutiny.",Human
3v5a50,"I agree with you, personal thoughts and beliefs *can* make you an asshole. Some thoughts are asshole thoughts because they can predispose you to act like an asshole or say asshole thoughts in the future. For example, if you think that [insert race] people are lazy, and continue to allow yourself to stereotype in your mind, then you will just be making yourself more prejudiced for the future. If you allow the pattern to continue, you will probably start to make decisions and act based on those thoughts. Therefore, asshole.

However, the reason why I am among those who often give people a pass for thoughts is twofold. 

1. We often don't have complete control over the thoughts we have, but we usually have a lot more control over the things we say and do. It is hard to fault someone for having a passing thought that they don't act on.

2. If a potential asshole posts about a thought or feeling they had, that means they have at least recognized that their thought or feeling is not kind/fair/popular, which means they likely recognize that acting on that thought would make them an asshole. ",Human
3vd8cz,"Hmmm, this is a tricky one. I understand your frustrations, but I think in this situation, if you do not word it right you may come across as an asshole.

Just because you do a lot for your room-mate doesn't mean you are **entitled** to be compensated.

3vd8cz,"Personally I think it's fair for OP to politely ask for compensation, just not push the issue if Jake says no. You're right that OP isn't entitled to compensation, but they are entitled to start doing less for this roommate if they feel taken advantage of. To completely avoid asshole territory OP could warn Jake in advance that the rides are going to be less frequent.",Human
3vd8cz,"I have definitely been in this situation before and it is very difficult to maneuver. You have been giving him rides, buying entertainment, and giving resources freely to him as a friend and roommate. Normally this would be shown as a nice gesture at the beginning. The issue is when you continued to do it without asking or making it clear that it was a limited thing, thus making it his norm.

If you cut back harshly or directly address the situation in a non sensitive way, their could be a backlash because he feels attacked or that you are taking something from him that he felt was just the norm. 

In the end, neither of you are assholes, but you definitely have a sticky situation to deal with. When the place is a mess, ask him if he could clean up X because you have to get ready for work or that you are trying to get Y done. If you are giving him a ride, tell him that you might have to cut back on some ride because it is becoming to costly on gas. Small things like this will not make him feel that you are going after him about the lack of input on his end, but will hint at him that you can't do everything yourself and you could use some help.",Human

3vd8cz,"Thanks for the response. I considered moving my stuff out in to my room but felt that was just too passive agressive and while I don't prefer confrontation, it's probably better than just moving it. But if things get to a boiling point it may be likely I do that. ",Human

3vd8cz,"No relationship is equal. Ever. Trying to figure things out down to dollars and cents is in no way going to make things work. Mostly because values differ between people and there's no way to have an absolute and complete system of measuring how many dishes equal a car ride to the store. 

First question: Does it really matter to you if you do a little more, or have a few more things that you share? 

Second: Can you and your roommate be honest with each other? 

Your best option is to tell them that you feel like you and your things are sometimes being taken advantage of. Next, do NOT make rules or stipulations about using your stuff. It makes a very strained relationship. After a talk about the situation, see if things change at all. Do they go out of there way to clean up more? Do they offer to pay for more gas? They might not be completely aware of how many things they were taking for granted. Having a conversion might help them see that. 

It's a tricky line to not guilt trip them about it. Cause you have to be honest so it doesn't fester. But it's not always easy to just lay things out without having some expectation. 

If you can't seem to find a good balance, I would talk about finding new places to live. Not everyone can cohabitate together.

My roommate is somehow scared of the vacuum cleaner and doesn't know how to clean the bathroom, so instead I let him take down the trash and empty the dishwasher. That's basically just trading one chore for another, which is no big deal. In the end we're both doing more or less the same amount of work around the house.

But in your situation you are trading chores for goods (TV/stereo/gas money) and that's just a completely different situation. In my opinion, you can't make such a trade without actively agreeing to it, because it's less like dividing the work and more like a business deal. For you to not be the asshole, you have to talk to your roommate and get him on your side. Worst case, if he doesn't agree, you can always put your TV and stereo back into your room and stop driving him everywhere.",Human

Talk to him about the house and what you want.  Let him know that you are struggling with continuing to adjust your schedule/lifestyle to accommodate his as you don't feel reciprocation.  If he's a decent guy he'll ask about how to make things more even.

No, they weren't. They noticed that the shoes were not rung up and were put in the bag, anyway. They walked away with merchandise without paying for it; that is stealing. It's not like he noticed on his receipt 5 miles down the road that the shoes weren't paid for.

In front of friends I think you did the right thing in laughing it off and playing it cool.  Even asking him about it later was alright, but you shouldn't pressure it more than that.  He can't change the way he feels about your video, and if he doesn't love it, he doesn't love it.  I guess the question you should ask yourself is: If he doesn't like something you have made or are making, should he lie and pretend he does so that you are happier?  Or should he tell you the truth, and give you his criticisms?

My solution to this would be instead of asking whether he loves it (which you know the answer to) ask him why he doesn't.  He is your SO and if you can't get constructive criticism from him, who can you get it from?
",Human

3w1omc,"You are kinda the asshole for expecting him to magically adjust his personal taste to ""love"" the video instead of just liking it. You said he's very affectionate and uses the L word liberally when referring to you. Maybe he feels that using the word to refer to a funny video (which he seemed to honestly *like*) would cheapen the word when he refers to you. If he told every person, object, and video that he loved them it wouldn't mean anything when he said it to you.

&gt;there's a part of me that doesn't understand why he's so adamant not to say it when he knows it'll make me happy if he says it at all, even if he's lying

Just because he doesn't ""love"" the video, doesn't mean he doesn't love you or want to support you as best as he can. You should respect his honesty, since he obviously isn't trying to hurt you.

My advice would be to thank him for his honesty and move on. It might be that there was nothing wrong with the video at all. I don't think the video has some flaw that is stopping him from ""loving"" it, he just doesn't use that word lightly.

I know I can get hung up on things like this, and at this point I'm also very good at making sure my feelings about them don't clash with my relationships).

I guess what has me hung up is that I know him very well, and he does actually really like it. I wouldn't try to force him to enjoy it. But maybe he does have a stricter definition of love than I do; this part makes sense to me.

I like to think of us as Marshall and Lily, but in this one particular sense... yes. (More context so you don't actually think he's crazy: we were friends for a very long time before we started dating, and had romantic feelings for each other for most of that time before we got together, so by the time of our first actual date, I have no doubts in my mind that he actually felt that.)

This is actually something I should have mentioned above, but it was part of the reason I was so frustrated. When I asked him once, jokingly, what we could do to make him love it, he said ""Nothing!

From your reply to another comment:
&gt; This summer I caught him on okcupid and craigslist talking to other women and trying to hook up.... I decided to stay with him and I'm trying to work on trust...

I kind of think you're a bit of an asshole for staying with someone after this but classing a strip club visit as a ""dealbreaker"".  Trying to hook-up on craigslist is fairly deceptive and a whole degree worse than ogling some titties at a bar.

The other thing is, from reading OP's responses, he denigrates her to his friends, and that's not right, and it's disloyal.  For all I know, they planned this party just to piss her off.

I'm doing so much better now it's ridiculous. I changed my entire wardrobe, got a new haircut, met new people, cleaned up my messy apartment, started eating healthier and losing weight, meeting friends more often... I'm genuinely happy, even though it still stings a little.

honestly from what little I read about his demeanor I'd say I think you'd be happier if you got rid of this guy.  

if he's already cheated on you then he needs to be proving himself to you at this point for taking his ass back.  
not throwing a fit that you don't want him to go waste a bunch of money while eye-fucking random women... WHO LIVE IN YOUR TOWN... who he could easily keep in contact with if he had the chance... and judging from his past probably would first chance he got. 
  

he's not respecting your feelings or taking your relationship seriously.  
if you say it makes you uncomfortable then that should be the end of it.  
it's a strip club... it's not like you're robbing him of his life long dream or some shit....  there's plenty of other more decent places he could hang out with his buddies at.     

let me ask you this... would he be ok with you going out all night drinking without him and having strange cocks rubbed in your face for hours on end while you throw money at them you could have used to do something fun with him instead? or even in general if you weren't showering them in money... cause I doubt it.... unless he's into that sort of thing... in which case idk what to tell you... other than again saying from what tiny glimpse i just got of your relationship that i really think you'd be better off with someone who takes your feelings seriously.

3w9d80," Based on your comments in this thread-

Going to a strip club is an absolute deal breaker but attempting to legitimately cheat on you with random people online isn't? 

The whole ""aita"" question might be moot at this point. In a healthy relationship, I don't think having an SO go to a strip club is a problem. You said yourself that the guy's wife is setting this whole thing up for him (the guy whose party it is). She obviously has no fear whatsoever because she wholeheartedly trusts her husband. 

You say that all his friends will think you're insecure, but if we're being honest here, you are insecure. You have very good reasons to be insecure. They probably don't know those reasons. Like it or not, what they see is an insecure girlfriend. 

You also mention that after you caught him trying cheat:
&gt;He sobbed and sobbed and begged **and it made me feel so good that he hurt**


I can empathize with this feeling, but you might want to consider whether this relationship is healthy and if it is in your best interest. 


",Human

Reporting your own assault is a very difficult thing, and it's something that the survivor has to decide for themselves if they want to report. Police often don't believe survivors, or don't treat the perp that seriously, so it can be re-traumatizing to report.

I think you're doing the right thing by being supportive to your friend, and I don't think you're being an asshole by not reporting. Mainly because you're protecting yourself from further trauma.

If you do end up reporting, you're not an asshole there, either. It sounds like you've got a pretty good idea of whether you're pushing your friend too far, so, you know, don't push your friend out of her comfort zone.

3wosrc,"&gt;my number 1 reason for feeling like I shouldn't have to pay is because I basically don't live in the house.

Oh, and they got the bill lowered because you don't use the internet much?

No?

Then pony up or yer the asshole. 

&gt; I have the smallest room in the house - it is significantly smaller than everyone else's.

Unrelated.

&gt;I know it would be dick to cop out of it, but I really do think it's unfair. Opinions?

Ask them nicely if they'd consider modifying the agreement because of your financial situation.  Don't try to use ""I'm never around"" as a negotiating point, since that has nothing to do with them, they have no control over it, and it doesn't actually save anyone money. ",Human
3wosrc,I've had roommates like you and i still hate those motherfuckers. ,Human
3wosrc,Just move out if you don't want to pay. ,Human
3wosrc,"Yep.  How I've done it before:  Take square footage of common area, divide by # of roommates.  Add that equal share of common area to the square footage of one's room.  That's your share of the whole apartment.  

E.g. for a 3 bedroom, 500/3 + 120 = 286.66, your share = 286 / (500+130+120+100) = .336 or just over an exact third. 

Divide the rent (and heat bill) according to that fraction.  Electric, cable and internet (and water &amp; garbage if applicable) should probably be divided evenly since use doesn't really correlate with square footage ""owned"". 

I think this is the most fair starting point for sharing rent.  It's certainly fine to negotiate further, if for example, one room is MUCH smaller, maybe it's fair to pay less than a proportional share since a very small room is an additional hardship - or if one room is nicer, has higher ceilings, further from the street, etc...",Human

3wv0qe,"Yes, you are the asshole. Street harassment is an exercise of power over women, not for mere sexual gratification, and the threat of violence implied in groping and catcalling can escalate to actual violence quickly. Just ask a woman what happens when they fight back. We are berated. ""Bitch, you think you're too good for me?"" We are followed home. We are physically menaced. Sometimes we are beaten or killed.

As a petite woman, I can't fight back because I *will* be overpowered. Women are taught to deflect and to mask their discomfort because it is the best defense we have. If Wendy sounded angry, her assailant could have anted up. Remember the assailant feels entitled to the bodies of women in public and that he would feel unjustly denied something owed to him if she protested. She ""laughed it off"" to appease her assailant because asserting herself would constitute a rejection of his right to her body and could provoke him to attack again so he could get what is his. She was absolutely not being flirtatious, she adopted an amiable tone that would allow the assailant to think he got what he wanted so he would go away.

When Wendy said ""I'm taken,"" that was meant to halt the assailant's attention because the dominance of another man is the only thing that will reliably stop a harasser from asserting power over a woman. Wendy did what she had to do to escape the situation with the least amount of trouble. If she got angry, it could easily have turned into a big scene.

Talk to her about it. Bring it up and ask her if she's worried about guys like that. Ask her if that happens a lot and how you could help her in any way. Boys will be boys is a good mindset, but it shouldn't be how she lives her life. She shouldn't shy away every time something like that happens.

Your anger should be with the asshole that did it, and the fact that he thinks okay to touch a girl without her consent. That's sexual assault! 
  
I get pissed when my wife tells me about some idiot that does this, but she refuses to tell anyone about it. I don't encourage her to try to fight these guys off, but I come across as an asshole because I think she shouldn't have to work with some fuck stick that thinks it's okay to do that; and she won't turn them in because she doesn't want to get them fired.

There's little chance this would go peacefully, so if he had to grab the guy's hand or push him away when simply turning around and saying, ""she's not interested"" doesn't work, would you agree this the right thing for him to do?  

If it were happening to my girlfriend in front of me, I'd want to step in to stop it definitively, and accept that she might be mad at me later for being aggressive or possessive, when the alternative would be letting a creep intimidate and assault her.

You certainly acted like an asshole, but she could tell it bothered you and she didn't give a shit about your feelings either so I'd say you were both being assholes.

But you can't make her be the way you want.  If that's important to you, find another girl.

My wife would never put up with shit like that.  She doesn't feel like her body is community property, it is hers and anyone touching her like that is assault.  She's chosen to share her body with only me.  Personally I value that attitude in a partner, because it's how I feel as well.  I'm very monogamous and don't flirt with other people.

Your girlfriend is NOT like that.  She doesn't consider her body all that private, nor have a problem being flirty with others.

These days lots of people are cool with that, but if you're not, you should consider your future, because there could be a lot more heartache for you.  (Doesn't mean you have to act like an asshole, you were being harsh with her for violating YOUR rules that she never agreed to.)

3wv0qe,"You're a young guy. You don't have much life experience. As you get older, if you pay attention to the evidence around you, you will see the pervasive violence women deal with on a daily basis just because they are women.

I'm sorry you have eczema.",Human
3wv0qe,"The life experience I DO have tells me that even though men hit on women more often, they deal with rejection a lot better than women do. I also have asked people like my grandmother and mother about this kind of thing, and even though I don't live in the US I think the level of culture in our countries is similar, and both of these relatives dismiss any kind of idea of being oppressed in society because they are women. Just looking at that blog - man throws out woman's puppy for rejecting his advances for example - are you really under the impression that women don't do this kind of crazy stuff? Of course they do, it's just they do it less often because of getting rejected by men because they don't pursue men nearly as often as men pursue women.

And well, it's the women that put this kind of thing in blogs because they get traumatized very easily; I mean come on, some women complain about catcalling like it's a tragedy. Catcalling. Sure, I get that it's annoying, but if you feel like you have to complain because men are complimenting you (granted in an obnoxious way) it sounds to me like you are sheltered and spoilt.

Because you are a man, you do not get catcalled. On the rare occasions a strange woman does call you out for your features you likely do not feel physically menaced by a size discrepancy. You don't know what it is like to practice lacing your keys between your fingers every time you go into a parking lot after sunset. You don't pay attention to lighting and egress in buildings and outdoor pathways to avoid places where you might be ambushed. You don't have to monitor your drink in restaurants and bars for fear someone will deliberately poison you.

Catcalling and street harassment is not a compliment. A large stranger obstructing your path and shouting ""hey baby, wanna suck my dick?"" is threatening. That is not a good faith question. It is a trap. It is virtually certain that a woman walking to the market on a Wednesday afternoon does not want to suck a stranger's dick. So what is she supposed to infer from the solicitation? Why would a man say that unless he had the power to force her compliance? 

Words, even facetious ones, can escalate to actions so catcalling requires a fight or flight response. A substantial portion of women are catcalled many times a day. The cumulative impact of so many ""fight or fligh",Human

However, I do know what it is like to practice lacing my keys between my fingers after sunset, again not often, but then I think your point was that women do this in general, not that they do it all the time. And of course I pay attention to my surroundings to avoid places where I might be ambushed, especially after dark, because 1) that's the intelligent thing to do and 2) as a man, I am statistically more likely to be assaulted and murdered. Granted not because I am a man, but that does not change the fact that I have very real things to be afraid of. 
It is true however, that I do not have to monitor my drink in restaurants and bars for fear of being poisoned. I accept that it is a lot more likely for a woman to be slipped drugs in her drink than a man is, but the chances are still very slim for a woman, so while I think awareness of what's happening around you is always a good thing, FEARING that you might be slipped drugs every time you go to a restaurant is simple paranoia. Every time I go outside I might be ran over by a car; this motivates me to be careful around roads, but it doesn't make me scared of them.

I concur that there is indeed a miniscule chance of a woman being willing to suck a stranger's penis.

My family had all had their vaccines and were able to see our kids. Had they not been vaccinated they would have had to wait.

Some people will tell you that you are being overprotective. It really isn't in this day in age. All it takes is watching a video of a child with whooping cough to know it is not worth the risk. I would stick to your guns. It's good for them to update their booster either way. If they can't do this small thing then they should have to wait.",Human

I always give out one piece of unsolicited advice. Dish soap gets out poop stains and food stains. It breaks down proteins so it will break up the stain. I remove stained clothes from baby, rinse off anything stuck on in hot water, pour dish soap on it and rub until the stain comes out. Then I rinse it in cold water and it is ready to go in the wash. This has save countless outfits. Kids vary and what works for one may not work for another, but the dish soap always works, lol. Best of luck :)",Human

If your parents don't think the booster is necessary, ask them to show you research etc that show as such. Of course it is your right to decide what boundaries and requirements to set, but professional opinions can even differ so if you take the word of just one it can lead you down the path to becoming an overprotective parent and hindering future development and learning experiences for your child(I'm not saying whopping cough is an experience they should get, but hopefully you know what I mean). Overall I think it would be a sign of trying to meet them halfway if you agreed to talk to your pediatrician about the subject.",Human

3xasw8,Nope. You're totally in the right here. Sounds like a first time dog owner who thinks their animal is somehow above being treated like a dog. They're pack animals. They do not mind being crated during times of inactivity.,Human
3xasw8,"Generally no, but it sort of depends on how much roommate is away.  If the dog would be crated for hours and hours while no one is there, that's really not great, but a few hours during the day as long as he's getting plenty of exercise and company otherwise is no biggie.  It's safer for the dog, especially if he might eat stuff or chew wires or get into stuff.    The roommate is an asshole for not cleaning up the mess his dog made, for sure.  

If you don't get to put the dog into a crate, then it's definitely HIS dog and not yours (plural yours).  ",Human
3xasw8,Any tips on how to get it through his head that it's not a bad thing? He's gone for 5 hours a day tops. ,Human
3xasw8,It'd be for around five hours a day tops. I'm home a few days a week and he works from home some days too. ,Human
3xasw8,"That's what some dogs do when they are bored and left alone. I absolutely loved my dogs, but when the recession hit and I lost everything and ended up losing my house with the fenced yard where they could roam all day (when they didn't roll with me- I owned a construction company and a lot of the times they would just roll around with me- they were great truck-bed dwellers and good about staying in the truck and not harassing passers by), and I had to leave the rural island I lived on and moved to Honolulu where I would work a 9 to 5 and they would have had to be penned up in a small yard all day- I couldn't do that. So I got a buddy of mine who owns an organic produce farm to take them on, as his dog had just died and the remaining dog was very lonely. They even got to do the same morning routine with him that they did with me- get up at dawn and go haul him around on his skateboard. Funny coincidence. I miss them, but I'm glad they are living it up in the country rather than spending their days in a small yard in the city, waiting for me to come home. But anyhow- no- you aren't the asshole- this person should probably not have a dog. ",Human
3xasw8,Cruel to be crate trained? Wtf. I'm not sure of the roommates dogs age or how long he's been rooming with you but it seems like he's been failing at teaching his dog what's okay to do in the newish environment and trying to put the blame on anything other than himself. This guy is not only delusional but also seems to be the asshole in this scenario. ,Human
3xasw8,"Is this a new dog? If so, I'd start by saying that when you agreed to live together, you didn't think it would be with a dog. If you wanted to be around a puppy, you'd have gotten one yourself.

After that I'd say that it's not cool that he's not cleaning up after his dog. Say that you understand he makes messes but you don't understand why he won't clean up after the pet.

At that point you should should explain that crating the animal is best for all parties, especially the dog. You (op) don't want to resent the dog or let this make your living situation uncomfortable. 

The dog will not mind being crated if the owner is a good one and gives him his due exercise. Explain that the dog being out of the crate does not count as exercise and that the dog will need walks wether or not it is crated. People usually delude themselves into thinking that a dog being free  to roam is somehow beneficial to them when it's not. Especially when it's not potty trained or cant be trusted around plants. Being out and trusted is a privilege the dog must earn and does so by learning to respect its own house (crate) first. When a dog learns to not shit where he sleeps, he's carry over that behavior to the rest of the house.

You know your roommate situation better than anyone so pick and choose.
",Human
3xasw8,"I don't think you OP are an ass hole for wanting to protect your own property.  Humane society and various other groups list half day as a decent maximum for adult dogs in general and they definitely don't seem to think its cruel.  Breed can impact this but I have no idea how to judge that. 

I suppose I have a personal distaste for doing it. We once took a dog onto the farm that had a tiny lung from always being in a basement crate.  

I also do not like that the room mate has a dog without a place of his own. I have waited years now to buy some farm property so I know 100% for sure that my dog will have a place with me and a huge yard to guard. 

So no, you are not the ass-hole, besides some personal misgivings of mine you are in the right. ",Human

Housemoms who have owned a couple dogs and never had to crate will tell you it's mean, but that's not an expert.  Ask anyone who walks dogs for a living, or trains dogs, or any vet, or any rescue volunteer, and they'll all agree.  He must personally know someone in those groups.   It can be cruel to just shove a dog in a box he isn't trained to consider a safe place to rest and lock it, but gradual crate training is effective and relaxing for a dog. ",Human

Obviously he gets something out of eliciting a reaction from your group so maybe you and your friends might agree to straight-up ignore him, or maybe to just shrug and say ""okay"" then turn around and carry on with what you were taking about before he interrupted you.

This guy has some serious issues going on. Like really big ones, at least socially, and probably a lot more than that too. If you understand that he's acting like a fucked-up, scared little kid who can't connect with people in a respectful, healthy way then you will see that he's on the path to a life sentence of rejection, ostracism, and unfulfilling relationships.

""At the end of the day, I don't really care what my gift specifically it is. All I care is that you chose it for me.""

Basically, neither of you are assholes. You just have different opinions. You want a gift you know you will use and appreciated, whereas she wants something that you chose specifically for her, showing her you made the effort and also surprising her.

You seem to be missing the point behind gift giving. It's not about utility; she doesn't need you to get her something she needs- she could do that herself, and she doesn't want to have to tell you what she wants (again, she could simply get it herself). She wants you to pick out something you think she would like. It's the relationship equivalent of a Rorschach test.

He just picked one thing off my list and I don't know which one I'm getting. ",Human

What she really wants is something thoughtful that lets her know you listen to her and know what she likes. 

Pro tip: from now on, keep an ongoing list on your phone and update it whenever she mentions something she needs or wants. Maybe she spilled coffee on her favorite scarf and ruined it but hasn't found a good replacement? Put that on the list. Maybe when you're out at a store, she points at something and says ""oooh look, that's awesome"". Write it down. It's not hard to do and it gives you a great list of gift ideas for any random occasion.

You could try to compromise. Go but get seats close to the exit so you can step out for a breather one or twice. Maybe a little immersion therapy wouldn't be so bad plus you'd have someone close to you too hopefully form a new and more positive association.

However, you need to take care of yourself. And if you can't handle a Star Wars movie, then that is the real problem here. There are tons of things that you see every day that will remind you of childhood memories if you let them. You need strategies to re-adjust your perception of these things.

I'm sincerely sorry if I sound like a jerk, but I think you're making some incorrect assumptions. First as I mentioned in the post, I only told my partner last night about the true reason why I didn't want to watch the movie. Before that, he thought it was just because I didn't like the acting and convoluted plots. Wanting to watch a movie that your partner is not that in to isn't a clearcut sign of them being a dick, it's just some insignificant compromise that everyone does at some point. This is the first and only time he has ever not been respectful or understanding. He was quiet for today because he was hurt. 

You're spot on with him not seeming to understand the depth of this. I'm certain this is why because this is so out of character for him. This is the same dude who nearly cried because he loved the look on my face when he presented me with a stray kitten that I adopted.

I also strongly disagree with your statement about how I'm making this about my partner instead of trying to deal with my issues.

They're being asked to divulge something that is extremely personal to every single potential romantic partner, which is a pretty big thing to ask of them. And it's not something that is really asked of anyone else who has potential huge deal breakers - for example, if someone is opposed to sex before marriage or they have a debilitating mental illness, I wouldn't expect for them to tell me that before we've even met.

How are these responses not identical? Aside from the latter using higher vocabulary words that you'd expect to hear from someone who is more educated.",Human
3xn5p2,"&gt;[I] feel like I should be made aware of that fact before wasting time and energy trying to date someone who I can't see a future with.

Why not just ask then?  Your use of the passive voice is ridiculous.  If you have any dealbreakers like that, I'd think that you'd bring them up at some point.  

I've seen this lots in people who are still ""on the dating scene"" for years, looking for Mr/Ms right, they can't bring themselves to have an honest conversation, everything is circles and hurt feelings because the other person didn't read their mind and interpret their circles (or both partners are moving in circles where nothing is communicated and everything is mysterious).  Just talk.",Human
3xn5p2,"One is someone acting grossed out by it, and the other is someone much more kindly and respectfully saying that they won't work out together. ",Human
3xn5p2,"This is a very good and very sad point. There are unfortunately many cases in which trans people have been killed due to an intimate partner finding out. Examples: [Angie Zapata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angie_Zapata), [Gwen Arajuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Gwen_Araujo). ",Human
3xn5p2,Dude not always.,Human
3xn5p2,"I mean, you can recognize a huge difference in tone between the two reactions. One is a respectful issue of sexual compatibility and the other is hatred directed towards the trans person. Unfortunately the 'being tricked' line of thinking exists, and it sometimes results in violent (and in many cases deadly) reaction. And the 'hes a boy dressed like a girl' reasoning is similarly offensive to trans women. Trans women are women, full stop.",Human
3xn5p2,"&gt; and the other is hatred directed towards the trans person.

I think saying this undermines the complaints other people have when actual hatred is expressed. I'm very respectful of the fact that LGBT people are often the target of hatred and violence, but equating ""ugh dude that's gross, I'm not gay!"" to actual hatred is not helping anyone. I can easily imagine a case and context where saying that is just awkward, not angry or filled with revulsion. If you wanted this to be your point you should have made the statement more obviously about hate and hostility, and not just some surprised ""bro"" who just sounds like he doesn't know what to say.

As I said (or implied), the first answer just sounds uneducated and basically not sure what to say, and just wanting to clear up the ""sexual incompatibility"" except they used less ""post secondary"" university tier words.",Human
3xn5p2,Nah. not always. ,Human
3xn5p2,"&gt; but equating ""ugh dude that's gross, I'm not gay!"" to actual hatred is not helping anyone

I recognize that it is not intentionally hateful or hurtful. But it is insensitive and hurtful (even if less so), and the fact that it isn't purposefully so doesn't change that. ",Human
3xn5p2,theres also the unfortunate fact that keeping your trans status a secret can sometimes be for personal safety.,Human
3xn5p2,"&gt; But it is insensitive and hurtful

Maybe. But lets not forget that you called it hateful, not hurtful. Big difference, especially since my whole point revolves around exaggeration. I'm careful not to come off too confrontational here, but this is certainly moving the goal post. I do not think you are being entirely candid here.

In the future I'd just suggest that you should be cautious about saying speech is hateful and horrible and repulsive unless it really truly is (and not merely awkward, silly, or hurtful). There is no shortage of examples that really are that bad and we still need words to describe them too.",Human

3xn5p2,"Yes, it does. But why is that my problem?",Human
3xn5p2,"Because such a situation could easily be avoided by letting me know. Why is the impetus on *me* to ask EVERY woman I go on a date with, on the off-chance that one of them might say yes? I don't ask every woman I meet whether she is a devout Christian, a 10-time divorcee or a prostitute.  

I'm not asking you to be like, ""Hi Piece_Maker, wow yeah Steve said you were tall! This is a nice restaurant... by the way, I'm trans!!"" but if it is you with the medical history as you put it (This is MUCH more than just a bit of medical history by the way...), then it is absolutely  on you to let those you are potentially going to be romantically involved with know about it.

There are *a lot* of things you wouldn't disclose on or before your first date. Kids or a divorce usually come up on the second or third date, not *before the first*. Kids or a divorce are also not going to make a person a target for violent crime. Being trans, though, evidently so confuses and enrages people that transgender people are disproportionately likely to be victims of harassment, assault, and murder. And you have no right to tell Kebin what they should do to protect themselves, mentally, emotionally, or physically.

I know if I asked a girl out to dinner, and she accepted, I would feel somewhat frustrated if she informed me she was only attracted to females. While I respect people's orientation, I think the fairest thing for a trans person to do is to find a way to bring it up as early as possible while minimizing awkwardness.

Yes.

As I said though, does a ""bro"" know that? I think it's inappropriate to mistake ignorance for hatred (which came up if you look at later comments between me and sunsunsun). When the first person is saying ""I'm not gay!"", it's fairly obvious they mean they're not sexually compatible due to the physical body of the trans person. They're not attacking the other person's gender identity or spewing hatred. Indeed, it sounds to me that they don't even know what a gender identity is. This sounds like an opportunity to educate so it is a poor example of intolerance.

All I'm saying here is that if someone is offering two examples to contrast how to handle the situation, the first was not so obviously bad, and they had very similar intentions to the second. The latter just used fancier words, so it really looked to me like unless you have a higher vocabulary, you are more likely to be seen as intolerant. Plenty of people have never heard the words ""sexually compatible"" ever, ever before, and it's not necessarily their fault.",Human

3xn5p2,"""Let not forget about science here"" - means that you can't be upset at the guy for being grossed out, as being grossed out after his brain was essentially tricked is a completely natural response. 

He may have found you attractive initially, but how attractive you perceive someone is based on what information you know about them. Being able to see you is only one part of that information, just a couple of the other factors involved are personality and intellect, and the health of the reproductive gland.

There is where our guy runs into the problem: all of his male ancestors that have successfully reproduced, and thus passed their genes to him, were looking for a female mate and found males having sex disgusting. When you put it all together in a senario where he thought you were a female, you have your expected response.

Disgust is a natural response to anything that will basically hinder or prevent you or your offspring from successfully reproducing. 

(ex. Germs/feces hazardous to your health/may kill you, ugly people (reproducing with) because your offspring will struggle to reproduce if it's ugly, basically anything you can think of that disgusts you has a reason behind it.)

And you also said it isn't a natural response *In your opinion*. That's what I was referring to with my last comment.

Your friend on the other hand is not the asshole, but he definitely is the one that fucked up here and next time I would be either extremely cautious about lending him money again, or at least have some kind of contract or legal binding that assures that you will get your money back in a timely manner.

If I were you, I would allow him to pay me back in the way he wants to. Making a big deal about it at this point could start a fight and end the friendship, as many fights over money can do. In that case, you may not see the money at all. 
When I was a little older than you are, I made a personal rule to not lend money to friends if I expected to get it back. So if a friend needs $50 and I have the money to spend, I give it and forget about it. If they pay it back, bonus cash for me! If they ask me for $1000, the answer is always no. I'd really feel that money if I didn't get it back. Most of my friends know my personal rule and don't ask, though I'm at an age now where most of the people in my life don't need to borrow money.

He broke your gentlemen's agreement, but he does have a plan to pay you back.

As others have already said, you have to begin any loan from the assumption that you ain't seeing that money again. It's the reason banks charge interest on loans - ideally, the interest paid by the paying accounts more than covers any money not paid by the delinquent accounts.

Something you may be able to work out with your friend: you were expecting to get that money back within a month; he's offering to pay you back over the course of more than a year. See if you can negotiate on something [reasonable] between the two; he won't likely agree on $1000 a month (which is roughly twice what he's offering), but he might agree to $250 a fortnight (paying you back fully in a bit less than a year) or agree to paying you back the loan with a bit of interest. US car loans are running at ~4.25% right now for those with good credit; see if he'd be willing to pay just 1 or 2% interest.

3xt7ks,that was not part of your verbal contact you not an ass... tell him that deal you set up was with your sister is your deal not mine and I need my money back sooner then that for other investments if he doesn't understand that hes not a friend... he should be able to go to his parents and tell them the situation and get a 6k lone from them that their daughter can pay back to them ect...its not what you talked about and its not the deal you made with the loan,Human
3xt7ks,"So, I'd like to expand on this just a little bit. I have a friend that's not too bright, but I feel could fall into this situation because he's just so trusting in this matter. For perspective, he completely believed that I left my phone at home and had to go back and pick it up when I didn't answer his call; I just knew he wasn't going to be at a particular place on time. 

If you know he's a regular dude (not my friend) either give him a pass, or go hardball on him, no in betweens. That way you set yourself up to be a good friend, or a no take shit friend. I've been on both ends, and in the end, it depends on how much you value the friendship.

BTW, in my case if this happened to me, I would totally let my friend off the hook. He was too much of a kind hearted simpleton to let go. Sorry.

I wanted to look like a hardass, but if it was him, I would have looked the other way.",Human

It's too late now, but you shouldn't have lent him the money.  That's what banks are for.  And if the banks tell him no, then you sure as hell should too.",Human
3xt7ks,This is a very well thought out opinion/response. You'll get the best results if you just work with him a bit and find a repayment plan that you can both agree on.,Human
3xt7ks,My basic philosophy is never lend anything to anyone if you are going to want it and/or need it back. If you lend money to a friend you must expect to either lose the money or lose the friend.,Human

3xwcoy,"Yes, you're the asshole.  Yes, what the other guy did was dangerous, but you flashed your lights at him five times.  That's a little excessive, and the guy was already pissed off.

Look, he was an asshole too, but you seem like a thoughtful person, (obviously since you're here)  and some things you should just let go.  This is how people end up getting beat up or shot.

I'm assuming you have a phone, and I would suggest calling 911 if someone is driving aggressively.  They take that kind of thing pretty seriously.",Human

3y23i3,"How much time has it been between the plan and the cancel? I'd say the assoholism is mostly about the inconvenience of rolling back the plan, and your culpability in causing that inconvenience.

There is a but, though. Your mom organizing a dinner with family is quite different than being forced to go party with friends and other people you don't know.

Your mom is probably looking forward to the excuse/opportunity to get family together.

18 is also a bit of a milestone year so the family is also probably excited to share it with you too.

If I were you I would suck it up, make the best of it and just commit to having a good time for a few hours not only for your sake but for your family's.

If the dinner was cancelled it will leave your mom with a hard job of calling every one to explain and then every one else wondering and speculating why you don't want to see them.

Not an asshole but as you become an adult a good lesson to learn is that life rarely goes your way and sometimes doing a little gesture to make people around you happy will go a long way compared to just sitting at home doing nothing.",Human
3y23i3,Yes you are pretty much an asshole.  Ever think about anyone besides yourself,Human
3y23i3,"It was planned, maybe this week, but months in advance I had said that I just wanted to stay at home with the family I lived with. It was brought up last night and my mother said she was going to cancel it now (nothing was yet paid for).",Human

3y23i3,"As he said. Not an asshole for not wanting a birthday party, kind of an asshole for having her cancel it just because you don't feel like it.

3y23i3,Why thank you.,Human
3y23i3,"I also hate being centre stage, but sometimes you just gotta suck it up. It's only one night out of the rest of your life and it'll make your family happy to share your milestone birthday with you.

It always helps, if you don't want to do something, to come up with an acceptable alternative. So rather than saying you wanted a quiet night in, perhaps you would have been more successful if you'd said something like, 'Well, I'm not really a party person, but perhaps we could have a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant for the immediate family?' That way, you don't feel so put out and your mum still feels like she's done something nice for you.

3y53v9,"I think she probably mixed up your signals. Saying that you liked her and then ""were fine""  with just being friends may have confused her. Being ""fine"" with just being friends doesn't necessarily mean that that's what you want, it COULD have meant that you were also fine with more. That could be what she thought, anyway, but no, I don't think you were an asshole. ",Human
3y53v9,"&gt; I'm fine with just being friends

and

&gt; I'm not interested in anything except friendship due to the distance between us

are two different sentences.  It's pretty easy to see why she felt led on.

Yes.  You're the asshole.  You left room for a huge gap in her perception vs your intention.  Such is communication sometimes.  You know exactly what you mean.  Every nuance is plain to you.  But language limits messaging as much as, if not more, than it clarifies.  Especially when it comes to emotions.  Be clear.  Then be clearer than that.  Don't leave room for misunderstanding.",Human
3y53v9,"Yes you're the asshole. You told her that you liked her and then said that you would settle for being just friends because she has a problem with the distance. Based on what you wrote, you don't mention that you have a problem with the distance as well. You admit that you were flirting with her as well. You definitely lead her on.",Human
3y53v9,Who cares if it was a one day relationship?,Human
3y53v9,"Sigh. Yeah my biggest regret is just not being clearer definitely. Thanks for the honesty. I already apologized but she wasn't having it. Conversation ended with a ""You're a piece of shit"" and I responded with ""Merry Christmas"". I guess that's that then.

 I still feel as though if this was a longer term thing I'd feel like a more justified douche but this was a 1 day affair. I don't know. Feel bad man. ",Human
3y53v9,"I did mention that I knew nothing would ever work out due to the distance, but yeah I definitely could have communicated better :/ Feel terrible. Essentially just came here to confirm I was a total arse.   ",Human
3y53v9,"""I like you but we're so far apart it couldn't work,"" is not an assholish thing to do. You're not an asshole, OP. You have a valid reason of not going through with a relationship with a girl you've not seen in a while. You owe this random girl nothing. You are not an asshole. 

Edit: Unless you started the conversation with ""I like you,"" then yeah, why even bother mentioning it?",Human
3y53v9,"You have nothing between you but some text conversations, over a very short period. There is no relationship. No one should be mad, if she is blowing up over a day or two of conversations maybe that is a sign. ",Human
3y53v9,"Huh?

What part of ""I just want to be friends"" and ""I'm not interested in anything except friendship"" is vague here?

He's not the asshole, I thought he made his intentions crystal clear.

He doesn't owe her a relationship because of a few flirts via text.",Human
3y53v9,"Girl flirts with guy = ""Oh, I was just being nice! Why does he assume I like him?""

Guy flirts with Girl = ""You owe her a relationship, you son of a bitch!""",Human
3y53v9,"1) who said he owed her a relationship? I said he lead her on which is a shitty thing to do regardless of gender.           
              
2) He wouldn't be an asshole if the only thing he did was flirt with her. He blatantly said that he liked her leading her to believe that he wanted to pursue a relationship.",Human
3y53v9,"This is just IM communication? Then, err, no, this doesn't mean anything, let alone leading anyone on. 

Still, you could've been clearer. ",Human
3y53v9,Ok why would you ever tell someone you like them if you not planing on at least doing something about it?? That is your asshole move. ,Human
3y53v9,"&gt; What part of ""I just want to be friends"" and ""I'm not interested in anything except friendship"" is vague here?

First two sentences of this post.",Human
3y53v9,Well she's the asshole now.,Human
3y83i0,"It sounds like your mom is a bit of a brat. She seems to be the kind of person who is never happy with what she gets. She told you not to get her anything and is upset you listened to her. She would have been complaining no one listened to her if you got her something. Some people are never happy. I might have gotten her something small, bit you weren't an asshole. She set you up for a no win situation. She is the asshole here.",Human
3y83i0,"Even though this person is your mother, she is acting absolutely out of line. The number one rule for gifts, is even if you don't like it, you're never to publicly criticize the gift. You're supposed to wait and privately talk with the gift giver in an appropriate way. Straight up complaining is not the mature thing to do. She is the inconsiderate asshole. The worst part is that she's not ",Human
3y83i0,"If you aren't old enough for a job and you're dad said don't get her a gift, then don't worry about it. ",Human
3y83i0,You aren't wrong. She will be unhappy no matter what you do. Not your fault.,Human
3y83i0,"She's the asshole in this situation. She was given a gift and complained about it, which is pretty rude regardless of what you get. Not to mention, she said that she didn't want anything for Christmas, so it's justified not getting her anything.",Human
3y83i0,"This is a perfect example of passive aggressive behavior. She's not willing to state her feelings, so instead she just punishes everyone with the silent treatment.  She's acting like an asshole.  She should never have said ""don't get me anything"" if she couldn't handle it.",Human
3y83i0,"Her loss I guess, if you keep ragging on peoples' gifts it isn't odd that people choose not to get you anything anymore. ",Human
3ybxdg,Nobody in this situation sounds golden,Human
3ybxdg,"No.

I don't know if it could have been handled better - if you were truly trying to avoid a conflict in the first place and escape without any altercations (which it sounds like).

As for pushing her and her falling over, the whole don't hit a woman because they're females bullshit needs to stop. If someone hits me or restrains me, male or female, I'll do whatever I need to do to escape from that person. If that means giving someone a whack I'll do it.",Human
3ybxdg,"It was wrong to push your mom, but you know that. It also sounds like she had a bit too much to drink. It was also wrong to say awful things to these people. Just leaving is the solution. Your mom was wrong to restrain you. You should have told your mom you had to leave for private reasons and you would be happy to talk to her later.",Human
3ybxdg,If you aren't in a sitcom you seriously need family therapy.  Your mom is hammered and your uncle wants to fight you?   Shit I wish you the best.  It sounds like you've had bad role models so I Doubt the problem is you. ,Human
3ybxdg,"LOL it kind of is a shitty sitcom, huh? Yeah you're right but they're not my role models hahaha ",Human
3ybxdg,Everyone here but you and your grandfather holding your uncle back is an asshole,Human
3ybxdg,Don't forget the five year old.,Human
3ybxdg,"Nah, he has it coming. The scumbag. ",Human
3ybxdg,"You're an asshole for being mean to some kids who come from a shit home. Even if their family is a bunch of terrible drunks, no wonder they're such shitty kids. That's not their fault. 

Not the asshole for pushing your mom. When someone is drunk and getting all up in your face the best thing to do is de escalate which is sounds like you tried to do. She shouldn't have been grabbing at you in the first place, what else were you supposed to do other than push her off you? I've been in that situation too many times and no I would not feel bad. 
You could have handled it better by just walking away- but she physically wouldn't let you do fuck her. ",Human
3ybxdg,I'd say it's still the kids fault for being assholes. no matter what their home situation is ,Human
3ybxdg,"It sounds like the problem is everyone, honestly. I had bad role models but I can't imagine yelling at a couple 12-13 year olds that their parents are alcoholics and telling them how horrible their family is. I'd absolutely tell them how shitty THEIR behavior is but to just delve right into ""Your whole family sucks and your parents are alcoholics"" on top of the rest of this shitshow? This sounds like the Jerry Springer show.",Human
3ybxdg,"Listen your family didn't act right at all but neither did you.               
From your perspective you sound like the best person in the story but again this is your perspective...
                        
I would just take this as a future lesson, to not be as aggressive and maybe take steps to prevent things like this in the future.                 
I think you acted a bit to aggressively but I won't give you the full asshole tag but just
less of an asshole than family tag but still sorta of a half asshole.         ",Human
3ybxdg,Too be fair she was drunk and with the sounding of her behavior in the story wouldn't listen to him. ,Human
3ybxdg,Well then by that logic you're the asshole for pushing your mom.,Human
3ybxdg,"Fair enough and i know my perspective is for sure not the one my moms side of my family has at the moment but i'm not the type to change a story just to make myself look less like an ass. I do need to control my anger but Idk if I mentioned that every time I go somewhere and that family is there, they do shit and it just added up on me because nobody else would do anything. But yeah fair enough, I can definitely see how I was the asshole.",Human
3ybxdg,"There's something really important here that no one has mentioned yet: His mom wasn't just not letting him go because she wanted to talk to him, she asked ""are you on drugs"" and then was grabbing at him as part of her trying to take his keys. It sounds to me like the fact that OP decided to take the family's usual passive-aggressive behavior towards the neighbors all the way into active aggression and telling a 12&amp;13 year old that their parents are alcoholics was some pretty extreme behavior and she was worried that he wasn't sober and shouldn't be driving. With all the facts in view, pushing her was an asshole move. However, it doesn't sound like it registered with you that her trying to keep you from leaving and take your keys and asking if you were on drugs was something she was actually worried about rather than just an excuse she was using to be an asshole. At the same time, your behavior was really not okay. Do not tell someone that age that their parents are alcoholics. Either the parents actually are active alcoholics and the kids are aware of that because the alcoholism is open enough that even you can see it and you don't even live with them, or the kids didn't know their parents are alcoholics but the parents are alcoholics and now the kid has a huge, life-changing new source of emotional turmoil and the family has an issue to deal with, or the parents aren't alcoholics but now you're the asshole who went postal and said that they were. And even if your mom did",Human
3ycpqk,"The word has a lot of depth and significance which is typically glossed over when joking about it.

3ycpqk,"If you are not black, you cannot say that word under any circumstance.",Human
3ycpqk,"Yes, you are, but everyone's an asshole sometimes and that's part of learning. A couple of things:

Picking the ""unpopular side"" of an argument, which in this case I assume is the racist side, just to be edgy makes you an asshole. To a minority, there is no difference between an ""ironic"" racist and a real one. Both reinforce attitudes that harm them, and both pretend that anything they say is exempt from criticism, because it's ""just a joke."" If your friend constantly downplays the experiences and opinions of black people as a joke, there's almost certainly some actual racism behind it.

Second, it is true that bringing humor to issue of racism is a good way to acknowledge it. That doesn't mean that you can say whatever you want, and have it not be offensive to anyone. The use of the word ""nigger"" by white people is, in almost all cases, offensive to black people. You cannot simply handwave away history, especially history that hasn't ended yet. Racism is not gone, black people are not treated equally by society, and it is not for white people to decide when and how nigger loses its ""stink,"" if ever. Nobody is stopping you from using the word, you can tell whatever jokes you want, but if using the word is more important to you than the feelings of black people, many people will judge you to be an asshole, and rightly so.

The point here is that your opinion on this issue really isn't that important. You're white, and you don't know the first thing about what it is like to liv",Human
3ycpqk,Maybe I should add that we both make frequent jokes involving the word cunt. Does that change the situation?,Human
3ycpqk,"Is the word nigger ever used on a non racist way?

It makes it worse, to me. In all honesty, you seem like a high schooler that's looking to push boundaries. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's important to realize that the boundaries exist for a reason.",Human

3ycpqk,"Yes, you are. It doesn't matter that ""you are gay and the word 'faggot' doesn't bother you,"" as you tried to point out in a previous comment. 

Personally, I would apologize to Todd, but that's your call.

Sorry, man. You can still correct this. I don't think you're a racist. I just think you're an asshole.",Human
3ycpqk,"It's so nice to see someone understand why they got an asshole consensus and learn something and apologize. Good for you, man. We all have some prejudice that we don't intend on having and if we could all just acknowledge when we're being assholes, the world would be a better place. ",Human
3ycpqk,I'm thinking yeah..,Human
3ycpqk,"Well I think one thing to bring up is how the word nigger is being used.  I don't for example believe that there's anything wrong with saying the word nigger.  For example, if you were quoting something a racist said, and you said verbatim, ""...and then he called him a nigger"", that usage of the word doesn't mean anything harmful to anyone.  That's what the person said, so that's what you said.  I think the same goes for song lyrics.  There's no malice in the word.  

However your actual post was about a joke containing the word nigger.  I can't imagine there's any case where that word could come up in a joke that's not perpetuating a racist opinion about black people, and so THAT is the problem with it.  In such a joke, you could take the word nigger out, and it would still be racist.  It's not about the word...it's about making fun of racism, which is something that has killed thousands and taken opportunities and quality of life without terror away from millions.  So to conclude, I only wish to bring up the point that you shouldn't be afraid to say a word, it's just a word, and black people don't have a right to say it because of slavery...that's stupid.  Racism is wrong, not saying a word, especially if another race can say it, and it's suddenly not a potty word.

I realize this could be offensive to many people, which is why I don't say it amongst people I don't know well enough, but just because you say it as a white guy doesn't mean you're a racist.

It's a typical behavior that it's observed everywhere. Movie goers that think it is okay to ask questions, talk or even discuss the movie during it's screening. Bad manners and poor etiquette. You should probably clear it up with your mother and explain to her why you were peeved though. Not the asshole, but I'm sure that the whole thing could have been handled in a more civilized manner.

I had a friend in a similar situation back when we were 18ish. We all stayed friends, but we were all totally no-holds-barred on telling her how fucking gross it all was and how poorly it was going to end for her (and did end for her).

Maybe you can get a sense for how they feel and try to have an intervention of sorts? Sometimes those messages come across stronger when everyone you love is saying the same thing.

I was on vacation abroad, she asked me to go shopping for a bunch of stuff that we can't get in our country - particular makeup, particular candy etc. I spent most of my last day going around to different stores looking for her stuff, got like 8 out of 10 things for her.

Edit: Just to give more clarity here, there were two items I got wrong. She asked to get a shade of makeup and I got the wrong one (I got brown instead of black brown). She also asked me to get a particular type of disposable pen which they didn't have and I got her a set of ones I thought were pretty close.

But the fact remains that the bathroom was not intended for that use. If you make someone else's day worse because they couldn't access the restroom that was built for them, you are the asshole. 

You're an adult and can plan your trips around where the bathroom is and what type of facilities are available. Toddlers can't and so families plan their trips around where there are family restrooms available.

It's an unfortunate situation that you shouldn't have to deal with, but it doesn't give you the right to limit access for others.  ",Human

In the original thread, someone linked to this page, which explicitly includes trans people as an intended benefactor of this kind of bathroom: http://americanrestroom.org/family/index.htm. You might disagree about those bathrooms' intended use, but at a lot of people and apparently the law agree that they're for trans people too.

Planning trips around bathrooms is actually a massive inconvenience — especially if you include ONLY single-person bathrooms that are NOT ""family"" bathrooms. Try spending a month using only that kind of bathroom. It's hard, unless you stay at home all the time or only go to the same few places. If you do take that challenge, I'm curious to hear what your experience is like. Using the bathroom as a trans person is often incredibly stressful (and sometimes outright dangerous), and there are often no unisex bathrooms available at all. Add into that the fact that spironolactone, a component of MTF HRT, is a diuretic and means a lot of trans women need to pee pretty often, makes it really freaking inconvenient to be hunting for comfortable bathrooms all the time. Eliminating even more places where we can use a bathroom comfortably makes it even harder. 

As for limiting access: Anyone, by using almost any resource, is limiting access to it for others. Trans people are a pretty well shat-upon minority that have a lot of trouble with a lot of things in public, and bathrooms are o",Human

There could be better communication going on though. Instead of expecting your parents to be home and cook a meal, ask earlier in the day what their plans are for the that night or the next day so you can plan what you will eat. Tell them it's difficult to come up with a meal at dinner time since they didn't inform you beforehand they would be eating out. Ask if they can pick up an ingredient you'll need, or if you can go yourself ask for some money assuming you aren't financially independent for the most part.

It seems like you have already grasped this since you can make rice and fish fingers on your own.  There are kids your age who can't even accomplish that yet.  Take some pride in your independence while still keeping a toe in your childhood.  Like others have suggested, ask your parents to take you to the grocery.  Figure out a nice meal that's a tiny step above rice and fish fingers.  One that you know you could totally own.  Have your parents get you the ingredients at the store, or ask them for a few bucks to get it yourself, and make them a nice meal that you can all share (if you schedule it right).  Then step up your game a tiny bit more, try something a little more complex.  Then again, and try something new.  Let the cycle that you set in motion continue.

While you're a nice guy for providing the furniture, your roommates didn't agree to any kind of deal, so the furniture can't be used to bargain a better room.

What you could do is ask them for some money for the use of the furniture. If they don't agree to that well... nobody asked you to buy it...

I think you had good intentions but maybe it doesn't add up for the roommate for you to get an amazing room without paying more for it because he can't afford the rent otherwise. I don't think it's fair to hold that stuff over their heads anyways. Did they furnish the kitchenware? Maybe they clean more and you get a benefit out of that.

Their son is pretty young (6 this year), I'm probably pretty young from their point of view (late 20s), they don't really know me *that* well, and they didn't realize until late this last trip that their cell phones still work in this country (they live in Canada).

I really don't want to be judgemental, because I don't have kids of my own.  But yeah, I do worry about him.

The one kids' activity I remember them doing last year was take him to this big arcade.  Last year, they wouldn't even give him money for the games, just letting him ""play"" the demos since he was too young to know better.  This year, he of course wanted to go again, and they actually gave him some money this time.  When he collected the prizes he won, his father chewed him out for wasting the money (nevermind that his parents picked most of the games and often took turns themselves), and pointed out he could have bought a whole box of those prizes with the money (nevermind that they gave it to him to play games, not do whatever he wanted).

It's sweet and sentimental, but only if both parties like the idea (and the ring). In this case, I think it's a little strange because normally the ring is a treasured heirloom. If what you are saying is true this is a ring that his mother doesn't even like and not something that she is proud to be handing over.

Long story short: can your fiance afford to buy a ring? If so, I would tell him what is going on with this one and think about having the stones remade into a new ring or have them just reset into a new setting (whatever).

2i12wc,"Did you know that engagement rings were a made up thing in the... 20's... I think... and it was all because the diamond hoarding corporation wanted to sell their diamonds. 

So your outrage is fueled by the notion that this whole engagement ring thing has been around for not even 100 years. ",Human
2i12wc,"Without knowing more about the situation, I'm gonna give it my best shot.  Unless your fiance is a cheap bastard, he was being sentimental and thought you would be happy.   I'm sure he didn't realize it was in poor condition.  Most guys are clueless about jewelry.  

You have to ask yourself, who is the ring for?  Is it for you or is it for your friends and family to ooh and ah over?   Does your ring have to have diamonds?  

Listen, I could go on and on about how the diamond industry is one of the biggest scams ever, diamonds will only ever lose value, blah, blah, blah, but I won't.  Bottom line is, spending a small fortune on an engagement ring just doesn't make sense.  The size of the ring has nothing to do with how much he loves you.

I made the mistake once when I was young.  I made my first husband buy me a big diamond, and my mom threw us a huge wedding.  She asked me before we planned if I'd rather just take the money, and I foolishly said no.   The marriage lasted three years, and I lost the ring while canoeing.",Human
2i12wc,"I wish I had read this before I made a post.  You made some really great points.  I can't help but wonder why nobody wanted the ring.  If it has bad juju, I wouldn't want it.  

Just one thing, though:
&gt;if he hadn't had this ring he would have been forced to buy one anyway.

It never struck me as fair that the man is supposed to spend a lot of money on something he has no say in.",Human
2i12wc,I mean you're not an asshole for being pjssed. I'd be pissed if my boyfriend popped the question with a shitty ring I hated. But I'd honestly be more pissed at myself for not making my preferences clear when it was clear that he should know. Did you not talk about marriage/engagement/rings etc. before this happened?

Hell, it could be made from wood for all I care. I'm upset because as much as I love the ring, I don't feel safe wearing it because it's damaged and I don't want my fiance to have to pay for another one if I lose the setting integrity. We're going to take it to a jeweler my aunt has recommended; he saved her ring after it had to be cut from her hand after an accident. 

Thanks for all the comments; it's really appreciated :)",Human

Nope. ",Human

2i12wc,"It's not the size of the ring that matters at all, it's beautiful. The ring is for me; why on earth would I want to have one just to show it off? The fact that's it's diamond is completely irrelevant; if it was another stone and the setting wasn't secure enough to hold the stone in place it's still a problem. I never made any demands about my ring, I didn't even know I was getting one until he pulled it from his pocket. 

I'm sorry things didn't work out with your husband but I very much doubt it's anything to do with the engagement ring he bought you. ",Human
2i12wc,"I suppose I am being unreasonable. We're going to take it to a ""miracle worker"" and he what he says. It's just a shame that I haven't had the ring all that long because I really love it. ",Human
2i12wc,"He could afford to buy another ring but I don't want another one. I love the one I have and if it could be repaired then there's no question as to whether I would have it fixed regardless of how much it cost. 

I know he believed it was sentimental, but nobody wore it, it wasn't worn as a normal ring let alone an engagement ring. Grandma brought it back from her travels and gave it to his mom as a gift when she wasn't well. But she didn't wear it because she wasn't very fond of it; which is fair enough, it's a matter of taste. I can't have children so it's not like she's given it to me to pass down. It just felt as though she gave it to him because she didn't want it; ""it may as well be used"". 

Thanks. I do feel a bit better about the situation. :)",Human
2i12wc,"Fair enough. We're saving for a house atm, so I wouldn't want him to spend money on a ring if he/someone else already had one. It's upset me because it's essentially broken and according to the jewelers I took it to, it's irreparable. ",Human
2i12wc,"Thanks!

I agree that it isn't totally fair, but I think that since traditionally the bride and/or her family pays for the majority of the wedding, it kind of evens out. 

I am more than happy to have a couple share the cost of everything in a wedding. I actually think that's the more fair, more modern option, but a lot of men also want to surprise their girlfriends, so they can't really ask her for half the money and then refuse to tell her what it's for. Ha.

I think the best situation is for a bride and groom to go together and pick out the ring together, so that everyone is involved.

Edit: In a reply to me OP said that her mother-in-law didn't like the ring because it wasn't to her personal taste and that the ring is actually not the mother's engagement ring, but simply a ring that was given to her as a gift at some point.",Human
2i12wc,"Well, if you love the ring then that is different, but still doesn't change the fact that you were told that it can't be worn.

Hope you get it sorted! Having the stones reset into a new setting seems the simplest solution to me and a way for you and your future husband to make some memories of your own together, choosing the new setting together.

Good luck!",Human
2i12wc,"If you love it, why are you pissed at him?  ",Human
2i12wc,"No, no, not saying that her outrage actual is, but saying that the whole major major reason being the outrage in the first place even existing is because engagement rings were made up by the diamond hoarding company. 

If they didn't exist and hadn't made up the engagement ring garbage, then there wouldn't be any outrage because we wouldn't know any different.

2i12wc,I'm pissed BECAUSE I love it and it can't be repaired. Did you not read any of my posts???,Human
2i12wc,"So I apologize and I misread your post. There's a disconnect between your title and your actual post. Your title sounds as if you're pissed *because* the ring is old and second hand and as a result is in poor condition.

After re-reading your post I realize that's not the case. However I do still think that you're the asshole because you're pissed off about something that cannot be helped and was a kind gesture, but at the same time, I'm sorry to hear that that's the case with your ring.  I guess you could always go and jeweler hop to see if it can be reset at an affordable price, since getting it reset is probably cheaper than getting a new ring in the first place. 

I wish you the best of luck, and once again, I apologize for having misread your post in the first place. ",Human
2i12wc,Don't start the last paragraph by saying your fiance THOUGHT he was being sentimental then. Definitely makes it sound like you disagree with that sentimentality. ,Human
2i12wc,"Okay, thanks for your honesty. Maybe I am an asshole for wanting to have an engagement ring that I can wear comfortably. I'm not pissed at him, just pissed at the situation and I know he's pissed too because he didn't think the setting was so poor, especially since it hasn't really been worn. Thanks again. ",Human
2i12wc,You're right. I shouldn't really have said that but I was just trying to get his side and feelings across ,Human
2i12wc,"Yeah at first I had a totally different scenario (I originally wrote this after getting out of a deep REM sleep-i have sleeping problems) but decided to re-read it just so I didn't end up saying some really harsh words because I can be an asshole too.

Yeah that really is a frustrating situation and I'm sorry things have turned out that way. I don't think you're an asshole for wanting a comfortable engagement ring, and I think that if anything, being pissed isn't the right emotion. Maybe just disappointment manifesting in anger is what's really going on here which is okay, that happens.

If anything, perhaps getting a different ring (doesn't even have to be expensive, just beautiful and comfortable) to wear/for the wedding until you have the money to get it reset could be an option, and then you could wear that diamond. 

Or another option, get a ring you both like, especially you, since you'll be wearing it, and just do the ring ceremony with the heirloom diamond, that way you still get to do ring shopping, fitting, all the fun bride-to-be things, and still you're able to do the ceremony with his families passed down diamond ring.

It's just another option so you do get the best of both worlds and your day can be just as special, as will be the memories of getting to have the opportunity to look for a ring. 

I obviously don't support the diamond industry at all anymore and I personally think they're a waste of money and support a global monopoly (because they do), but it's ",Human
2i12wc,"Maybe it wasn't always a shitty ring but since it's falling apart I would say it is now? I just think it's ridiculous.

2i12wc,"Point taken on the diamond comment. Redacted.

Now, back to the original point if you're the asshole: yes, you are.  

You cannot think critically or take advice without jumping to conclusions about somebody's intentions. Furthermore, you're so shallow that you cannot appreciate a kind gesture for what it is. You're so shallow that you're more worried about losing a rock and ring around your finger so much so that you can't properly enjoy the fact that you just got engaged. You are sullying what's supposed to be the greatest day of your life. I hope you remember that you're so shallow of a person that you can't think of anything else and cannot focus on the man in front of you who reached out with the kindest most loving thing he could do and that is give you a ring around your finger and call you his wife.

I realise I was wrong, and the ring isn't the most important thing in the world, but it was a gift from my future husband and I wanted to wear it every day for the rest of my life, and now I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

2imkcf,"&gt;When I told my adviser I was informed I was being disrespectful for trying to work around the system and going over her head after getting a no.

That response is completely ridiculous. It was beyond unprofessional for her to make this about her. Advisors are supposed to be there to help you.

No, you were not even slightly the asshole here.",Human
2imkcf,"You were not the asshole. When deciding classes, an advisor is just that, an advisor. Not a dictator. Her job is to make sure you get the classes you need to graduate. You found a better option that worked for you. Nothing disrespectful about that. But if it was disrespectful and it saved a lot of money, do it anyway. College is too expensive already. And the professor has more knowledge than her about what counts for your requirements.

Also wanted to add, if you end up going to an outside institution, then applying that credit toward your degree, every time you apply for a new college/ try to get into grad school the new school will want to see transcripts from both institutions. So if you went to AB university and took an online course from CD to meet the requirements of AB, when you apply to EF grad school, you will need transcripts from AB and CD colleges. Not such a big deal unless you already have other transcripts you need to track down. I now have five colleges I need to send transcripts for.",Human

I don't think OP was an asshole to explore other options here, and I think that the adviser took OP's actions too personally.  


BUT, I think that OP needs to be really careful about fulfilling the requirements *correctly*.  Because it would really *suck* if he/she found out during senior year, a week before graduation, that an additional upper level class wasn't good enough to override the failed lower level class.  And this shit happens *all the time*.  I would *not* trust the word of mouth from older students, because requirements are *constantly changing*.  


**TL;DR:** It *could* be the case that the older professor is not up to date on new requirements, while the adviser is being pressured to make sure students follow some *new* requirement.  OP *needs* to be sure what his/her program requires.",Human

People often don't know what they want, and almost everyone talks behind people's backs part-time. So if you're upset, be upset, but there's probably no need for a big confrontation.

It's understandable if you don't want to continue what you consider to be a high maintenance friendship.  But before you do so, you might want to try just sitting down and *talking* with her directly about your concerns first.  

Because your complaints honestly don't really make her out to be such a terrible, two-faced liar from my point of view.  You have to push her a little more to speak her opinion.  You might have to stop yourself from interrupting or dominating conversations so much (a lot of people do this without realizing it).

To do this quickly, I might buy my bro a new set of books, and tell him to stfu and not lend anything to your friend anymore. I'd also use this as an opportunity to tell him that you don't want to be involved in any of his issues with other people. That's not your job, he can work his own problems out. 

As for your friend, I would hold them at a reasonable distance, as far as trusting them with things. But you seem to have a handle on them, and don't seem bothered by their behavior much. If you are bothered, which I would be, you might want to consider expanding your circle of friends.

But turning it into a social experiment? Yeah, that's kind of an asshole thing to do. Don't do that, just remove yourself from this nonsense.",Human
2kcqnm,"There's something you're hiding or changing here.  What is it?  The loan mysteriously changed from books to games.  And how did it change from your brother potentially disowning your friend to eventually disowning you?  Are you really the ""friend""?

I don't really see any problem with your brother's need to confirm the honesty of your friend, (unless he's the one who is using the words ""social experiment"", which would make him sound like a supercilious tool).  If this ""friend"" was known to steal in the past, it seems to be quite fair for your brother to be careful about him to be unprincipled now, and try to steal the loaned books again.  If he does, I still wouldn't call your brother the asshole for ""writing off"" the friend.

 The disowning gun didn't change targets along the way, he *was* literally testing both of us. I don't get it either.  

I didn't see a problem with testing my friend either, (even though our relationship has been rock solid for 5+ years now)  but as he continued to explain his plan for all of it, it turned out that he also wanted to test me by not letting me know what he had lent out, and i would ""just do as he said"" and asked for his things back. Thus— and I'm directly quoting here—making it impossible for me and my best friend to *conspire against him.* Another argument I didn't understand.

  After arguing for hours I got fed up and told him to just tell my friend what he wanted directly so no one would try to be the wiser and everyone would be happy. But that was too much for him to even so he flipped his shit. And so here we are, my brother seemingly an asshole to me, and myself not knowing what to makes sense of.",Human

However, the issues here are 1) the amount is substantially less than the correct amount and 2) the sales assistant has special needs. 1) shouldn't be a particular concern, because if it is acceptable to buy something accidentally sold to you at, say, 20% less than the correct price, then it is no less acceptable to buy something accidentally 99% reduced. With 2), one could argue that it is the shop's responsibility to ensure that their staff are capable. After all, if the employee wasn't special needs but was just young an inexperienced, then people wouldn't be going out of their way to correct their mistakes. 

The main counterargument here is that special needs employees are different in some way, and we should be looking out for them collectively as a society. It's a complex one, however, because why should we collectively look out for special needs people and not look out for ""ordinarily"" stupid people, or those who are just inexperienced? Should we be looking out for anyone who is not fully competent at their job at all times? Is that a duty for every customer or consumer in the country whenever we go shopping or use any service?

What are you basing this on?  Do you assume that you are fully entitled to steal every time you think of a foolproof way of getting away with it?",Human
2a16oi,"Perhaps I worded that badly. I should probably have said ""as a customer I am fully entitled to shop around for the best deal, and purchase an item at the lowest possible price I can find which is *agreed between me and the selling party*"". An accidental discount is not the same thing as stealing. You are not deliberately trying to deprive someone of their property without their consent. They are still selling the product to you, and you are paying the price they ask. You haven't gone out of your way to misdirect them, confuse them, or otherwise manipulate the situation to your advantage. They've just made a mistake. You are aware of this mistake, but you did not manipulate them into making it; it is entirely accidental. You just so happen to be reaping the rewards of it. Crucially, you are purchasing an item after the legitimate seller of that item has agreed a price with you.

Say a store had a two for one sale on for a week. You come to that store the day after the sale finished, but they still give you the two for one deal. You're aware that you shouldn't really have got this deal, and didn't even come into the shop to get it, but you don't say anything because you can't believe your luck. That's not even close to stealing, right? Or say a game developer accidentally releases a game at a massive discount for a few hours, and word gets around quickly.

While he didn't walk into the store and straight up steal the thing he wanted, OP knew he was being grossly undercharged, knew that the employee's mistake was the result of the employee being mentally deficient and not done intentionally as a favor to the OP, and instead of being upfront about the fact that the mistake was being made, allowed it to go on. The moral laziness that allows this kind of shadiness is usually justified with ""well, I tried to pay for it"" or ""I paid for it at the price the person charged me for,"" or ""well, he didn't notice, and I didn't say anything, so I guess this really costs $ .25."" No. All those things are wrong, and you're justifying a douche move to yourself when you think those things to ease your own guilty conscience. If you know how much it should have cost and you let someone undercharge you because they didn't know any better, you did something wrong. 

Under what circumstances would something like this NOT be a black and white issue? ",Human
2a16oi,"I've said this elsewhere here, but it seems the problem you have boils down to a claimed moral imperative that special needs employees should be looked out for by society as a whole (rather than just the owners of the shop, or their co-workers) in a way that is substantially different from how most people would treat other retail employees. What if the sales assistant had been an ""ordinary"" stupid person, an experienced worker who just wasn't paying attention, a young, inexperienced worker, or someone who was deliberately flogging stuff at a massive discount because they hated the company? Should we be looking out for anyone who is not fully competent at their job at all times, or who may be deliberately harming the company they work for? Is that a duty for every customer or consumer in the country whenever we go shopping or use any service? 

What if the accidental discount had not been as large, say 20% lower rather than 99% lower? Would that still be as bad? What if it was 5%? What if it was 55%? Any difference?

(And I don't even get the feeling that you left out anything that would change my mind, which is usually what happens to me when I read these things.)

Breaking up is always hard to do to someone, and there never is a good time, so I really don't find fault with the timing, particularly since the issue was made pressing by the possibility of him moving.   I once decided to break up with someone only to find out her father died (young) before I made time to deliver the news.  I waited a month, and then an uncle died, and I waited months more, and she lost her job...and months later we when I finally left I am sure we both wished I had done it when I originally wanted to.

The one issue I take with the whole story is that if it were a perfect world, and everyone were honest, open, caring, adult, and never selfish or neurotic, I would wonder why, when he wanted to move to your city, you didn't just tell him how you thought things had gotten difficult between you.  Therefore, if he moved closer, (and got his own place initially) it would be with the understanding that you are both trying things out...to see if things had gone bad only because of the distance and pressure.  Most people would choose not to move, but if he did, you may have found that things still work from a reasonable distance, or it ",Human
2az53t,"It sounds to me like you are a thoughtful person, and you did the right thing by ending a relationship that you didn't see moving forward.  Breakups have a way of bringing out the worst in people and I can understand that.  When you're in a relationship and it is going well, you have a tendency to start putting all your eggs in that person's basket, if that makes sense.  Seeing a very important relationship get downgraded right before your eyes can be a traumatic experience, and one way people sometimes process this emotionally is to completely revise the entire relationship experience to better match the pain and rejection that was felt right at the end.  

You don't have an obligation to be with someone you don't want to be with.  You did your best to let this person down as gently as possible.  That's all you can do.  If he does ""truly hate you,"" there's nothing you can do about it - that's not your concern anymore.  Maybe some day down the road he might come around on his own, he might not - that's up to him.  The best thing you can do is to LET GO, give him his space, and not let it bother you.  

I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you feel better soon.  ",Human
2az53t,"Wow it sounds like your situation was terrible too. It's nice to hear from a confirmed man's perspective. I guess I couldn't let him move ""to see if it would work"" because it's just too far, too much of a life change, just too much to ask of someone. If he had already wanted to come to this city (I never got the impression he loved it), or if there was somewhere here he'd love to work, I think maybe that would have been an option...earlier. I guess I just knew by Feb that we weren't the right ones for each other. And you're right about that last thing, I forgot I do that too. Thank you  ",Human

2b1kyp,"Does he happen to know anyone at the pool chemical dealer?  Maybe he asked about the position and greased the wheels for you, but wanted you to think you had gotten the job yourself.  If so, when you dropped it on a technicality he had already resolved, that was kind of a final insult.",Human
2b1kyp,"He doesn't know anyone there, but I guess it's possible he asked. I also don't really think it's a technicality when it's a 21+ management position and I was 18 and never had a job for more than a few months.",Human
2b1kyp,"I don't think it was really about the pool chemical job. Sounds like your Dad was frustrated with you and having difficulty expressing it. He picked the fight or jumped on a minor disagreement as an opportunity to yell. 

Yeah, he used language he shouldn't have, and it wasn't his place to send in an application for you. But it also sounds like he genuinely wants what's best for you. I'd have difficulty calling him an asshole when he clearly loves you, put you through years of private school, and is now letting you live at home (presumably rent-free?) while you pursue what you've decided you want. If that's the case, he *is* being supportive of your career choice - he is literally supporting you while you pursue it. He just may not be emotionally supportive in the way that you'd like. And that's too bad, but the other kind of support is something a lot of people don't have, and it's something to be very grateful for.

To me, neither of you is the asshole in this situation. You just need to really talk to each other as adults. Maybe your mom could help mediate, if necessary? Or you could just approach him, ask him to sit down and talk, and express that you appreciate everything he's done for you and you'd really like the two of you to have a better relationship. 

BTW, if you're applying for jobs, you really should have a resume. Do you have one now?",Human

I do have a resume now in the form of the clases I've taken, but apparently it's still not enough quite yet to get hired anywhere in my desired field.",Human

My dad used to do the same thing, and I didn't understand until recently how big of a deal it is to plan out your day only to have it be undermined by someone else wanting something unimportant.

Are you wrong for asking? I suppose not. Are you wrong for pushing the subject and trying to get him to do it despite him saying no? I think so, at this point arguing further would be trying to guilt him into it. (he would feel guilt since you're his son and he does want you to be happy/be with your friends).

I think the comment about not getting your license is irrational, but saying ""no"" because your mother has the car is fair enough.  Even if he knows she'll be leaving the car elsewhere, he's probably already thought through the whole thing, knows there isn't time, and doesn't want to hear you whine about whether or not you agree with his assessment.  So I don't think he's out of line by using Mom as an excuse, but nor should you be expected to know its an excuse.

Doesn't want to work at McDonalds?  Too bad. 
 
Definitely do not allow this to become a permanent thing or let it make you and your girlfriend start fighting.  If you have to take a day off work to make sure she gets the fuck out of the apartment and onto her feet make sure you do it because it's a slippery slope.

She should have consulted with you, but you need to be a little understanding. I understand not wanting to be involved in the drama and worrying about her overstaying her welcome or bringing the person who assaulted her into your home. 

I would make sure to see up ground rules. Make it clear that she only can stay for x amount of time, she can't have anyone over, etc. Talk it over with your SO and try to find a compromise you can both live with. Be patient with her and try to understand that your SO feels the need to help out her bname sister. Also, it makes sense they asked you to check out her nose.

2b7py5,"&gt; So **the SO** had recently moved into a new apt. She is **trying to make this our home** and get me to spend more time there. I am with it. I have been investing time and money into it. And also **started bringing some of my things there**.

Here is the part of this story that I find a little confusing and maybe the source of the friction. I have bolded the parts that are particularly interesting to me.

Your GF moved into a new apt and you have remained wherever it is you live. She wants you to move in with her, but so far you haven't, other than staying over part-time and leaving some of your belongings there. Your GF pays the rent on this place?

Is it possible that it just didn't occur to your GF that she needed your permission to let someone stay in her own home? Is it possible that she doesn't think of this apartment as your shared home, but rather her apartment that she is waiting for you to decide to move into fulltimme?

I'm not trying to be rude, so hopefully it doesn't come across that way, but this is how I see it: Imagine that you rent an apartment and you ask your GF to move in and she declines/is reluctant. She moves some of her stuff in, but maintains her own separate home. Wouldn't you think of the apartment as your home that your SO just stays at sometimes? Because I would. 

I'm not sure that it would occur to me to ask your permission either in this situation if I were your SO. I mean, I wouldn't expect you to ask my permission before letting your sis",Human
2b7py5,"I am ok with this. Except when I call it her house she gets upset with me and says ""our house"".

2b7py5,"Sometimes you get caught up in all-hands-on-deck situations. This is one, and unless the sister has some history of violence you're going to look like a piece of garbage if you act selfish or petty about this.

2b7py5,"The woman was assaulted. It's her sister. I find it a complete no-brainer that she would be able to stay for a few days. Perhaps your SO didn't consult you because it didn't occur to her that you would object. To be honest, it seems kind of unimaginable to me to turn away a family member who's in that kind of a situation. Since you asked for honest input, here it is: the way you're describing your reaction to all this sounds quite cold. Do you have any compassion for this person, or for her child? Or are you only focusing on how all this is going to affect you?

Based on your description of your reaction, your annoyance at being asked to take a few minutes to look at the woman's injury, and your defensive responses in this thread, yes, I'd say you're without question the asshole.",Human
2b7py5,"So again. I would not have objected. But I would have at least liked to be notified. As others have stated, there are things that need to be discussed prior. This was not an emergency. It happened hours ago. This did not require prompt decisions.

Secondly, have you ever been on /r/medicine or /r/ems? Have you noticed that threads from people seeking medical advice are down voted to hell? There's a reason for that. It puts me in a difficult position. Anyone in the medical field will agree. ",Human
2b7py5,"Your thread title didn't say you wanted to be notified. It said you wanted to be *asked*. Look, if my sister was abused and asked me if she could stay with me for a few days, my response would not be, ""Hang on, let me ask my boyfriend if it's okay with him for you to stay in my house, because he stays with me sometimes and he might not be comfortable with it."" It would be, ""Of course you can stay with me."" I don't think that's an unreasonable reaction. Your response to that situation, *especially* since you're saying you wouldn't have objected (so why bring up the sister's estrangement and irresponsibility in your post?), seems overblown and a bit childish. As far as I'm concerned, when a family member is assaulted, you put that shit to the side and do what you can to help.

No, I have not been on those medical subs, and I can certainly understand that medical professionals might have to tell people that they just can't help, much as they'd like to, for any number of reasons (liability springs to mind). But that's not what you said. You seemed annoyed that you'd even been asked, because it was infringing on your ""off time."" Your attitude in describing the request was sarcastic and dismissive.

Those are two of the reasons that my opinion -- *which you asked for* -- is that you were the asshole in this situation. As a larger point, I don't understand why you're arguing with everyone who came to that conclusion here. If you were so sure you were in the right, why did you post i",Human
2b7py5,"**TL;DR:** Yes.

&gt; Her estranged sister has just been assaulted by her bf. I need to go downstairs and give her mother the keys to the house so her and her son can stay over. I am pissed.

A woman was assaulted and your reaction is that you're *pissed off* because you have a share an apartment with her?  When you even still have your own place you can stay anyway?  Really? Is your empathy *that* broken?

&gt; Now this person who has been described as irresponsible is now going to be staying in this apt. Unsupervised. With a toddler.

It's her kid, what do you want her to do?  

&gt; For what is supposed to be 3 days (I know it will be longer).

Probably, but again, what is she supposed to do?  Of course she's broke, because she was probably the one staying at home with the kid.  Hell, that's probably why she was with that asshole for so long, because she was dependent on him.  Instead of complaining, you could try looking for women's shelters and job opportunities for her.

&gt; It wasn't an emergency anymore. This even happened the night before.

She might have a broken nose and you're saying that this is no big deal?  Seriously?  

&gt; This dwelling that's supposed to be ours except when it's convenient for it not to be is now once again her house.

So you're pissed about the sister, but I get the feeling that's just a byproduct of this larger issue here.


&gt;  I'm just annoyed that she went to save this person who has been less than sisterly to her and has been known",Human
2b7py5,"That's my point. The larger problem is that her whole family uses her constantly. If she hadn't had this brand new apt I'm sure they would have found other means.

She's just a blank check to them with no reciprocation when she needs it.

I get that she's a leech and I can sympathize.  But abuse is abuse.  She's not there because she spent all her money on drugs and lost her apartment.  She's there because her boyfriend hit her.  Unless she was attacking him with a knife at the time, this wasn't her fault.  Be firm on the rules for staying at your place, and be clear on how long she has to find another place.

Anyway, you're in it now. I would say that you should draw up some very clear boundaries with your parents.

I do feel that way but family members have called my subjectivity into question.  Many of my friends insist that I'm fine, but I don't trust they aren't an echo chamber so I came here for an unbiased opinion.

I had hoped so, yes.

&gt;However, I refuse to believe, judging from your father's close relationship with his pastor, that you didn't think this news would cause significant tension on your family.

Contrary to my hope, I did think that the possibility of, at least my father, disowning me was real.

&gt;The house was a bargain, but why financially immerse yourself in a living situation that could sour so quickly?

A combination of reasons; partially my mom pushing us to stay, partially the ease of the agreement (buying the house we already live in means we don't have to pack up and move), and partially hope that the transgender thing could be addressed and they could come to accept me in time.  Had I known then what I know now, I'd go back in time and tell me to just move.

Those are assholes. They would NEVER be allowed to get away with that if some stranger bought the house. And they tried to cheat you on the price. Can't you see that?  

And now because the trans thing is a big deal that's become the focus and no one is even looking at them taking your space that you own and pay taxes and insurance on. That still makes them the assholes. 

It might make you naive, dumb, or lazy that you chose not having to move over this craziness but it doesn't make you an asshole. And what you want to do with your penis is none of their business. No matter where you live. So that further makes them the assholes.

To be fair, I'm partly to blame for this.  I didn't think these terms were a big deal and I agree to them.  FWIW, they do cut my grass for me.

I know you've accused me of being passive; I'm generally not a passive person, I'm just not really speaking my mind to them on the matter because I'm doing my best to salvage my relationship with my parents.

Covered in another post, even if I am resigning myself to the loss of the relationship, selling the house back to them is still in my best interests because it means I don't need to worry about realtor fees, or about finding a buyer and waiting, or about fixing the house up or agreeing to concessions over minor repairs that are needed...

In my opinion, you're not an asshole. Because your objection comes from a place of logical discontentment. ""I don't think knowing someone for 2 weeks is good enough to base a marriage on,"" would be one objection, and ""I don't think you should take a proposal seriously if it follows a hasty breakup"" would also be an objection. Both perfectly reasonable ones, I might add.

Now what does it look like from her point of view? Well, who knows... I don't actually know how to empathize with someone who could take this proposal seriously. But we know at base value that she's hyper-insecure, probably somewhat illogical (ya know what with missing the red flags here) and likely, in some way, desperate. So that means that she may very well think that you're an asshole, and she might defend that point to the utmost.

Someone with that perspective is really way out of your reach. She's not one piece of advice away from a stable POV, she's like a whole lifetime of therapy away from a stable POV. So, you should speak your mind, and be serious about it. And you should let her do whatever it is that she has a mind to do. She sounds way too mixed up to be logical about this, and that's on her. It being on her doesn't make you an asshole. Adults need to have their wits about situations like this, but you can't force someone to 'get it.' They just kind of have to.

Now comes the attempt at advice (although I'm no expert).  Has the sexist commentary continued?  Has he done anything else that was out-of-line or abusive since then?   If so, and another incident presents itself, I think you have to speak up and explain the problem when it occurs, either to him personally, or among the group of all four partners.  If you just decide to call him out after weeks of stewing without a new mistake to point to, you run an increased risk that he and the other partners will silently start to think of you as the cause of the problem, and it will erode your value to them.  (I'm not saying they'd be right to have this attitude, or that it makes sense, but just that it's something it would be wise to anticipate.)  So, if the offender does make another comment that the others should agree is abusive, you should immediately speak up, and this will probably demonstrate your value to them as the raiser of standards, and probably get at least two of the partners on your side immediately, making it much easier to convince him that he's wrong, or control him he doesn",Human

You can structure the constitution of the corporation to protect your ability to participate in decision-making, etc. That way if the boys all gang up on you they still have to involve you in making decisions because the company constitution says that they have to. In a partnership you don't have the same protections. Talk to a lawyer about it.

We actually are a corporation. A 75% majority is necessary for all decisions, a 100% majority for major decisions that affect the basic organizational or legal structure of the company. We're all equal shareholders with 25% each. So I'm pretty safe.

I was probably curt when speaking to him. Meaning that - after repeatedly being interrupted and thus unable to do my job - I was impolite to him by impatiently rushing through the handover and only saying what was absolutely necessary. I can guarantee - objectively - that anything I did was mild. A bystander wouldn't have noticed anything out of the ordinary.

The only exchange I can remember in detail - probably because it was the most fraught - was when he asked me if we should improve our product above and beyond what our client had asked for. I began explaining that this particular client didn't want us to make any modifications other than those explicitly requested. I wasn't able to finish that sentence, because he interrupted me twice to explain his take on the client's expectations. Those two interruptions and the ensuing tangents took up about 15 minutes, which I clearly remember because we were already late for a meeting and I was watching the clock. In the middle of the second tangent, I starting talking over him, and explained that the client had sent me an email clearly telling us to change nothing about the product other than what they had requested. He got very quiet after that. Maybe five minutes later, he dropped the sexist comment.

What definitely did not happen: name-calling, raised voices, offensive body language, or anything that could be called ""insulting"". Until he took it there.

The only point there that relates to feelings is that an offensive comment bothers her and makes her think less of the person who made it, which seems like a fairly rational and ordinary response to the other facts in question.  In the interest of fairness, OP additionally admitted that she was irked by the partners during this meeting, and she may have established a negative tone before the comment occurred.  Unless she is or was married to one of the partners, or is known to bark like a dog, or personally also did something outrageous like tell all the partners that one of them has a tiny penis, there really isn't any more context we need to know.

I will say, that it's better to avoid having to be rude in the first place though:
I don't know your situation, so this may not work for you, but I personally don't answer the phone if I don't know the number dialing in.

First off, promptly hanging up on them = not the asshole.

As for barraging them with insults, I get the frustration, but the person calling you is literally sitting in front of a screen. They hear the line connect and a script pops up in front of them that they have to read. If you say you're not interested, there's a script for that, too. Their boss is listening in on the call. If they deviate from the script, they get reprimanded, possibly fired. They're essentially expected to act as robots. In fact, the only reason those companies probably don't use robots is because robots have a higher hangup rate.

Of course, in response to that, you claim this:

Some people decide that our office should buy what they sell, so they call and ask for the guy who's name is the same as the name of the company, pretending that they know him. Because of this, our CEO will never pick up a call unless he knows the caller, or he gets a full explanation of what the call will be about, and it's not trying to sell him something.   If I ask the caller what the call is about and if they are one of these salesman, they hang up on me, saying they'll call back. And they do call back, and when I recognize them, I try to get in a word edgewise before they hang up to explain that they will never get through.

Kind of dodging the question there, but I assume it's because he can't empathize with the feeling. It may also be shocking to him so he isn't responding properly. Hard to tell without pressing into him further.

Ask him not if he's just TELLING you, but if he ACTUALLY WOULD have kids with you. If he does, and we'll say he's not lying just to milk the relationship, you have to be prepared that he may not be a good father if he ends up regretting making the decision to have them. 

I wouldn't say you're at fault for wanting to break it off. He's already broken the trust and your goals in life conflict each others. It's possible he'll want to come around but you'd have to work with him on it.

If you are in a two year relationship with someone, aren't close with the sister, and never met the baby, I'm guessing he's not that close to the situation either.  People deal with grief in different ways, and a lot of times it has to do with your relationship with the departed.  No one wants a miscarriage or a dead baby, it's a tragic event.  Personally though, I feel a lot worse for the parents than I do for the baby in this kind of  situation.  If it isn't your kid, it's more of a ""Let me know if I can be there for you"" moment than true grief.  That, and it sounds like he had a couple months notice that this was coming, so it gave him time to deal with any emotions he might have had about the situation.  So for you to be angry and tell him how he should feel or act - you are the asshole.

On the other hand, what came out of the conversation is that he has been dodgy and manipulative on whether or not he wants children - on that front he is the asshole.  If it's that important to you, and he's just saying what you want to hear, you have every right to stop wasting your time and break up if you want to.

Him not wanting kids and lying to you about it is a bit problematic for sure. It's better you find this out now than later. His defensiveness and hostility is bad news as well.

Jane has started taking Johns car without his permission (he can't drive so it would sit there otherwise) and leaves rubbish and food wrappers inside it. She even leaves for work without him (they work together and she only got the spare key for car pooling them in the first place). She is still being a huge bitch to me. If John asks for the car key back there's a good chance she'll either kick him out before he's found a new house or she'll get drunk and crash it... Which she's done before into road cones.


I came up with a plan (which John loves) of printing out a photo of me to hang from the rear-view mirror and spraying my perfume all over the car and tangling my bra and panties on the handbrake/steering wheel while chucking some other clothes on the seats. We really can't think of another way to make her leave the car without her kicking John out. Would this make me an asshole because it would be classed as ""starting shit""? Or is it fair enough because it's Johns car and he's already said he'd be stoked with me leaving those things there anyway. ",Human

If you have any messages where he says these things to you saved you should print them out and show them to the school guidance counselor. If he is threatening suicide they may be able to do something. I can't say with 100% he wouldn't do it, but it sounds like he is trying to emotionally manipulate you to get his way. Maybe it won't go any further than it is, but a lot of what you are describing sounds very disturbing and the kind of thing that a stalker does. He also sounds unstable and aggressive, unstable people can be dangerous. It isn't something I would just drop. Get help now. Document any and all contact, even if it is just keeping a journal. Avoid talking to him, but if he does talk to you make sure to write down the when it happened and what was discussed (not in front of him, mind you).

I'm not trying to excuse her behaviour and you're certainly not responsible for making sure other people pass individual assignments but can you imagine how shitty you'd feel if someone explained something to you, you didn't understand it, and all they ever did was repeat the same sentence louder and more impatiently while acting like you're a stupid waste of space for not getting it? Makes me think of impatient people who talk louder and slower to non English speakers and then get frustrated because they still don't understand. 

Like I said, she has a bad attitude that you're not responsible for but I feel sorry for her for always being shat on when she reaches out for help. Asking for help when you need it is a vital part of an adults work life and I'd hate to see her become too scared to do so. ",Human

So there's a lot of validity on either side of the argument when it comes to the intersection of adulthood and parental control. On one hand, 'my house my rules,' on the other hand, 'don't stunt your children's growth by threatening their autonomy with your narcissism and neuroticism.' (Not too hard to guess which side I empathize with.)

I too lived in this situation. To combat the sense of heavy control, I started becoming noctural, so that they would just fall asleep before I got back. But then *they* became nocturnal, so I started staying out till dawn. I mean what the fuck crazy business is that. Eventually, I just said, ""I am an adult, you can respect that or deny that, but I can do what I want on my schedule."" There was a lot of resistance, but when it became clear that I meant it, they were somewhat forced to back off.

It is of course relevant if you're a student or a worker or if you help out with the finances-- I can't imagine having a damned curfew if I'm paying some of the bills.

That might be a little overboard dude. I lived in a similar situation to OP a few years back. Old enough to move out of my parents house but I still lived there (for a small amount of rent). Yes, when it's under someone's else's house, you respect their rules. There's a unspoken (but sometimes spoken!) agreement when you live in someone else's house that you agree to their terms. If you didn't then you need to adjust or move out. Now, maybe OP's parent's were a little more strict than they should have been. I think OP needs to talk to them and learn when she needs to clarify what ""late"" means (for my parents who turn in at 8PM, late is a whole 'nuther world to them). My mother didn't mind how late I was out or where the hell I was, as long as I told her ahead of time or left a message as things changed. Turns out even when you're old enough to move out, your parents never stop worrying about you.

I'm sorry about your situation, that's rough dude.

For the record, I don't think you're an asshole, and I don't think I should *have* to do the described scenario above.

And yeah, once you see all the people standing and repeating the same chants pledging alliegence(I know that's spelled wrong but my phone refuses to acknowledge it) , especially in schools at young ages, you realize how creepy it looks",Human
3416z0,"In my opinion you're both probably in the wrong. (I don't know your exact reasons so I can't really tell.) He is an asshole for calling you out on it because their are valid reasons not to stand. For example, if I saw a Japanese kid who wasn't standing, who knows if it's because his grandpa died in an internment camp. That's a pretty solid reason.

One point I think people need to understand about the pledge is that it is not an oath to the fucked up politics or religious shenanigans in politics. It is a pledge to the idea of individual freedoms the U.S. was founded on. The other is that the pledge is a way of respecting those who served and died protecting it. I know that sounds like some patriotic malarkey, but I'll try and explain it better.

If you were a veteran whose friend was killed in the middle east while you were on patrol with them, that would be hard. If I came back from the war to the sight of young people who didn't give a flying fuck my friend died, that would hurt. Now if you consider whose more likely to be watching your pledge, a veteran or a politician, who is this boycott affecting more?

One other thing to note is that the ""under god"" part is not really part of the pledge. It was added in later and more than likely will be removed again. If your not standing to raise attention to that line, I would say you're better off just not saying that particular line to show your disagreement, but you still respect the ideals of the pledge unless you are in a large",Human
3416z0,"Well then I have to ask, how would you know the persons background to judge if they were an asshole or not? What if they happen to not agree with  the war or maybe it is because of the internment camps but how would you know without talking to them first? My reasons are that I'm an atheist and it is because 1. I do disagree with the wars we have been in the past 20ish years 2. I disagree with how our police forces have been dishing out injustice and 3. For all of the evil things our country had done for the benefit of a company or a politician 

Also I would hope that a soldier coming back from war to see me not standing would be happy to see me exercising the rights they ""fought"" for  ",Human
3416z0,"You wouldn't know the person's background to judge. But the older the person is, the more credit I tend to give their opinion. Even if it's flat out wrong. The reason for this is because when you're a teenager you change a lot. The person you are when you're 14 isn't the same person as when you're 16 or 18. Eventually you sort of stabilize in your early to mid twenties. The longer your opinions have been cemented, the more validity I give to them. Sorry, but high school students opinions are not very permanent. So when I see an older person I tend to think of them sitting as a real reason.

That may seem harsh but most adults have been there and done that. So it's an opinion were likely to share. I'm not to judge if your opinions are valid or not; in the end it's really up to you whether to stand or not.

Keep in mind it's not really my place to judge your opinions, but like I said, standing for the pledge in my opinion is supporting ideals the country was founded on. There are other ways to disagree with wars and politicians. The main way is voting, however I will agree that for some reason the candidates are almost always scumbags. The police are an issue. I'm not 100% sure on how to go about showing your support of reform, but I don't think standing for the pledge is the best option to show your opinion on the matter. I would imagine getting letters published in a newspaper or writing to senators/congressmen would be much more effective.

There's a connotation to it (which I realized when I went with my friend) that would make anyone uncomfortable. I'm sorry, this probably is making you feel worse and that is not my intention. It could be completely different. If he was a significant part of her life, then I understand the jealousy. If he was just some guy she dates for a month, it sucks but let it go.

3462ie,"Most corporate office jobs (particularly remote ones) have plenty of big holes where you can be employed without actually being noticed. Congratulations, you're in one of them!

You should know right off the bat that what you're doing is unethical. You are being paid for (presumably) 40 hours of work a week, and are knowingly delivering far less than that. Granted, all of us white collars slack off for notable portions of our day, but by your own admission, you're going to an extreme.

Whether or not you're an asshole comes down to where you fall on the corporate ladder. Do other employees count on you doing your work to get their own done? Are other people picking up your slack (knowingly or unknowingly)? Are you lying to people when they ask about projects you're working on? If the answer to any of those is 'yes,' than you are an asshole.

Otherwise, you're unethical, but not really hurting anyone other than your boss/owner/shareholders. That doesn't make you an asshole, but it does make you a thief. If you can live with that, then ride the gravy train until you get caught - and you *will* get caught.

Just be aware that every week you spend doing literally nothing in this current position is damaging your ability to better yourself and get a better job up the chain. You should be using this time to master your job - even if you hate it - so you can work toward getting a better one. If you spend all of your paid time avoiding work, you aren't learning anything. You aren't i",Human
3462ie,"It's a trap I've fallen into many, many times. Nearly a decade in restaurants, another 6 years in menial part time jobs - never doing more than the bare minimum because I hated where I was. Started in a corporate job, stuck to the same path. ""I hate what I'm doing, so I'm just going to coast by until something better comes along.""

Dealing with the stress of a job you hate is hard. Really really hard. Having to spend your day doing something you despise, but knowing you can't quit, is hard to deal with.

But the only way to get out of where you are stuck is to force yourself upward. You have to be the one to elevate yourself - that opportunity isn't going to show up on its own. Try to find some motivation - family, kids, an expensive hobby - anything that will give you a reason to put up with the job. It's easier to focus on that kind of thing if you have a juicy carrot at the end of a stick to chase.

Not only will you be a stronger person at the end of it, but you'll be able to walk into a company you *are* passionate about, and be able to tell a story about how you turned a terrible job into a great one, and how you strove for the best when you were handed the worst.",Human

I'm not going to lie, a lot of where I ended up comes down to luck - or being in the right place at the right time. But that luck wouldn't have helped if I didn't have any hard work and effort to help get my foot in the door - to borrow an old adage.

When an opportunity to jump out of the restaurant industry and into a brand new company turned up, I was able to get the job because of my positive attitude while (literally) scrubbing toilets and floors. When I was stocking shelves at Walmart, I approached every day as if I was a manager. Always went above and beyond my pay grade. Always the first to volunteer for extra work. When I was doing mind-numbing data entry, dealing with customers that got off on chewing me out and complaining about nonsense problems, I dove head in and worked my way to be the top performer in my job title.

Those stories got me the job that would eventually pull me out of the much and into a career I can see myself staying in - not unhappily - for the rest of my working life.

So, yeah, there's light at the end of the tunnel, but it's the fluorescent bulb in your new Manhattan apartment, not paradise. I'm not promising eternal happiness - you need to make your own happiness - but if you try your hardest to no",Human

I get what it's like to hate your job. My last job involved 90hr weeks where I earned below minimum wage in an environment where my coworkers hated me because they saw me as being ""a strict fucking nazi"" because I tried to put an end to them using the N word in front of customers, regularly coming in an hour late every day and trying to find out which staff member was stealing iPhones. The only reason I stayed was because I was 21 in management so my resume looked great and I was about to complete a program that would have given me my own store. I finally quit after my boss made a move on me and I realised being financially stable wasn't worth it if I woke up every day wanting to die. 

Even if you hate your job and the shit you have to put up with because it promises a decent future (lord knows I've been there) you are still an asshole if your lack of work crosses into unethical grounds such as tricking your boss into paying you for more than what you do. There are lots of people out there desperate for a job who would appreciate it because living in poverty is worse.

If she absolutely insisted the underwear needed to be tumble dried (maybe it had to do with the material?), then you could have compromised even more simply by asking her to do just her underwear, which would take much less time than a full load, then do the rest in the morning.

2lcln7,"You probably could have handled things better but he sounds like a real dickweed so I wouldn't worry about it. If your mom wants you out of there or has some issues with you not driving, that's a discussion to be had between the two of you, it's not really his business.",Human
2lcln7,"are you talking about me storming off? that probably was a bit of a teenage moment on my part. i was pissed lol.

your point of view over me moving out matches mine. im cool with going before im 25. i dont appreciate doing it under his authority though",Human
2lcln7,"In general, it sounds like he is an asshole, what with the silent treatment, slamming plates, and making judgmental assumptions about the validity of other people's time spent behind closed doors.   But, you're an adult, and since you're still living with your mom, you're in a situation where you must expect to be treated somewhat like a child, so he gets half a pass.  

If you're wondering if the ""move out by 25"" comment is out of line, I'd have to say it's not.  The standard that any parent had in mind the year you were born was that if they were to have a kid, they had to find a way to totally support that kid for 18 years and make schooling possible, after which point, they could expect to relax into retirement or move or travel without the burden/cost of supporting a dependent...unless things went unusually wrong.  Even though the law that implies this deadline hasn't changed, more extensive modern educational requirements and recent economic trouble have extended this schedule by a significant amount, so I think it's fair for you to expect more leeway than ""get out or pay rent at 18"", but it's also quite a significant sacrifice for a remarried mom and step-dad to give you an extra 7 years before they really expect you to fly on your own.  ...And it doesn't seem out of line for him to think you need a motivating reminder when you're already 3 years overdue for getting a license, which is a troubling sign.

All in all, I'd say you both sound cranky but, no harm was done, ",Human
2lcln7,"Except that it's her mother's boyfriend making the comment. Her mom would be well within her rights to say something like that. A boyfriend who's been in the picture for all of 5 months has no standing to make that sort of comment.

Not to mention the fact that, even if he DID have standing, saying it like that makes him come across as a judgmental prick. His other behavior makes the comment also petty and childish.

How is it petty and childish to be honest and clear about serious issues relating to living arrangements?",Human

2lp307,"Yes, I think you were the asshole. I understand the frustration that comes with having a messed up order, but it's really just a 5 minute fix, on the 1/100 chance they made a mistake.

You were justifiably annoyed at that particular McDonald's for messing up two consecutive orders, but you have to consider the fact that, statistically, your order is overwhelmingly likely to be in order. You are potentially wasting irreplaceable time of the people behind you on the very unlikely chance that you'll have to spend 5 minutes getting your order fixed (most likely time you'd have to waste whether you found the error while at the window or after pulling off to the side.)

Your last point, that the next customer would likely have to wait 30 seconds before getting his food anyway, isn't that solid. First, he might not have to wait at all. Depending on what he ordered, they might have had his food all ready to go. Second,  the person at the back of the line, before the speaker, is waiting to pull up to the speaker and order. The sooner he gets to the speaker, the sooner he gets his food.

As a general rule, customers at businesses designed to maximize speed should appreciate the sense of urgency of the other customers and respect their precious time. 

If you have a special need to studiously inspect your food, that's on you. Move out of the way and check your food on your own time.",Human
2lp307,You make a good point.  The delay to the guy at the speaker hadn't occurred to me.,Human
2lp307,"I don't work at McDonald's but I work at a different burger place and I get what you mean but it can be frustrating for everyone. Sometimes I'll have 5+ orders that come off at the same time I need to hand out, or one order had an add on so more accumulate because we already started cooking those and its not like we can stop. If everyone would sit there and inspect their orders it makes it hard because other people's food might get cold and then they return it and we have to remake their food, meanwhile the order after theirs is getting cold and we could have to remake that too. It's just kind of a domino effect, but you're right a good amount of the time it is our fault so I understand you wouldn't want to get out of the car. It's unnecessary the guy was laying on the horn at you but it can be hard to please everyone. 

I feel bad because at my work I know I can come off rude because if I'm not moving the drives fast enough I get yelled at. Each car is supposed to be done within 30 seconds (or quicker ideally) and if the customer sits there or keeps asking for different things it takes a while and there's nothing I can do about it. Meanwhile we're supposed to provide excellent customer service obviously- like a lot higher than regular fast food places. It's a little hard to when in the meantime you're getting yelled at to hurry up while we're doing what the customer wants. Sorry i went off on a little tangent and I know you weren't even asking if it's rude to the workers. Ju",Human
2lp307,The honker was the only asshole here unless you took longer than thirty seconds inspecting your order. I've had a second bag of food come out later than the first when ordering salads or parfaits. I've also had to wait thirty seconds to get some ketchup or salad dressing. The only time I ever honk at someone is if they are doing something extremely unsafe on the road. Even after missed left green lights I imagine the person holding up the line feels embarrassed and doesn't need an audible reminder. ,Human
2lp307,"I know exactly what you mean, we've just recently had a new McDonald's built in my area so I guess the reason why I have the highest error-rate on drive-through orders there is because the staff is still inexperienced.

Anyways, I always double-check my order but I never thought about blocking the handout window because most drive-throughs in my area have at least one parking space where they send you to wait if your order won't be ready right away, so I usually just park there and check my bag. There's also almost always an entrance next to the handout window so I don't have to walk far if something's amiss.

So I hate to have to come to this conclusion, but if I were the guy behind you, I'd be pissed even if I knew what your reasons were.",Human

But, is there ever a limit to this rule?  I agree that it's selfish to make a stranger wait 5 minutes to make my life more convenient by 5 minutes.  But what if the stranger only loses 5 seconds to save me 5 minutes?  Isn't it just good sense then?   I also kinda thought people in general accepted the idea that the person in the front at a drive thru window had the right to check that his stuff is right (since it's the fastest opportunity to resolve the problem)...but I guess I was wrong about that.",Human

In this case, this was a loan. With no clause, verbal or written, stipulating share of the profits. The only legal right you have is to get your money back. You can actually sue for this. A contract doesn't have to be in writing to be effective. (I don't think anyone would go through the trouble for 500 USD, however)

You say he's immature, his behaviors are immature, so I don't think a mature conversation is possible. Even if it is, he won't learn what he needs about life, women, and this issue from you. Maybe find a mutual friend to explain this sort of stuff to him. If you try it might dig his behaviors in deeper because he wants to spite you.

So you win.  But, it's worth pointing out that although you did nothing wrong in terms of book choice, he evidently got under your skin and made you join him in making the scene worse.  You could have ignored him, or told him to mind his own business, or possibly changed train cars.  Instead, you inexplicably swear at him in a foreign language, which sort of erodes your moral high ground and supports his asinine point-of-view.

If you wanted to speak up for yourself, it should have been in the language everyone in the car was likely to share.  Don't get me wrong.

There were probably 30 people there who could have done something and didn't.

My goal was achieved of shutting him up. Diesn't really matter to me at least as to details. 


  With regards to speaking Serbian, why shouldn't I? Chances are around here you'll hear quite a few languages spoken, so I can't see how my Serbian can be deemed any different. Plus my intention was, as I say above, to get him to shut up rather than deliver him an oration. ",Human

She thinks she knows better than you, the person who has lived with this disorder for 6 years and seen how crippling it can be?

2nfj2m,Hence why I urged OP to end it.,Human
2nfj2m,"&gt; What can be expected of the right person for someone with an issue like this.

Not the person you were speaking to, but I can answer this question. 

To start, if you don't have a mental disorder, it's nearly impossible to understand and empathize with one. I'd say that 99% of people cannot understand mental issues that they don't have. It's not their fault for not being able to understand, it's just the way it is. Even doctors who are as educated as it gets, even they don't really 'get it'. While they may be able to guide treatment, understand it on an intellectual level, talk to anyone with a disorder and they'll tell you they've run into a slew of doctors who didn't understand. It's just the plain and simple fact, most people cannot empathize with different types of brains. It's too alien from their own. It makes people look bad and insensitive, but it is just what it is.

So, that being said, the right kind of person to partner with, if you have anxiety or something related is usually a person who experiences similar and like issues. 

But, you are asking about neuro-typical partners, I know.  That rare unicorn is someone who is able to understand the difference between neurological and behavioral actions. Again, most people can't. That rare person also has saintly patience and doesn't get frustrated when a neurological condition causes something that looks behavioral and is aggravating. Say, when a person with ADD forgets something simple for the 100,000th time.. mo",Human
2nfj2m,"This all seems quite true and reasonable for the first reaction to someone with a neurologically atypical issue, or even as the average person's reaction to repeated experiences with others with a neurological abnormality.  But OP's girlfriend was in the picture for 3 years.  Even if it doesn't come naturally to sympathize with someone who's mind works differently, you have to be particularly dim or self-centered to see them suffer through a major issue over and over--and try your suggested solutions with no success--and still not recognize or at least acknolwedge that overcoming anxiety may be a substantially different challenge for him.  ",Human
2nfj2m,"&gt;  you have to be particularly dim or self-centered to see them suffer through a major issue over and over--and try your suggested solutions with no success--and still not recognize or at least acknowledge that overcoming anxiety may be a substantially different challenge for him.

You would really, really, really think that. And, honest to god, I wish that's how society and human beings worked, but they don't. For illustration, let me give you a recent and relavent example for me.

I have PTSD. My dentist knows this. We've talked it over backwards and forwards. Recently, I had an appointment in which she had to give me anesthetic, all very normal, right? Well, the anesthetic had epinephrine it it. Epinephrine is adrenalin. What happens if you shoot a person with PTSD up full of adrenalin? There is a very high likelihood that you are going to trigger the fight or flight reflex. This is expected. 

When I had the expected reaction, said I needed to sit up and deal with the reaction, the dentist had the nerve to ask me if I have ever tried meditation. 

Now, I want you to think about something. Imagine someone came alone with a needle full of adrenalin and hit you with it. There you are, body full of adrenalin, heart pumping, sweating, and all the expected medical side effects of such a thing, and then they ask you - why don't you just meditate? Nobody on earth would say that to you and it would be infuriating if they did. 

But, because I have PTSD, that's what the fucking ",Human
2nfj2m,"Again, what you're describing is perfectly reasonable and accurate for the average person's reaction to an initial incident and a number of repeated incidents.  But your dentist doesn't live with you every day.  She probably doesn't have extensive experience with people who have this condition, and if you've been going to her for 2 years with this issue, she only has a dozen or fewer experiences with you and this problem, and doesn't need to give it a second's thought over the course of the months when you're not there.  So she can't be expected to adjust her thinking like the woman the OP has seen every day for 3 years (if they're not living together) and has probably been aware of some anxiety-based issue with him every week or more throughout that time.

Every idiot in the world thinks of themselves as a knee-jerk expert on any condition they had that was solved by a simple treatment a doctor or friend suggested.  If I had consistent back pains that were solved by hypnosis, and I hear a friend has a back problem, I'm not going to hesitate to tell him where he can find the same therapist or book (or whatever) and try the same thing.  Now, if that friend had just been in a car accident and has bruised or damaged spinal discs, this would be stupid advice...and upon finding out about the accident, I would be obliged to realize it's stupid.  If that friend weighs 450 pounds, and I'm in good shape, and he tried the hypnosis with no success, I'd also have to consider that what wo",Human

I guess if you want to be all capitalist about it, take the **sum of what your parents paid for the license and the car**, then get a vague figure of how much **commuting to school over the course of 2 years** (like you mentioned) **would cost**, cut the latter one in **half** (that half you want your sister to pay for) and see which figure is higher, the money your parents paid to get you on the road, or the gas-money your sister ""should"" be paying for rides. Depending on who pays for insurance and eventual repairs this would either be added to the stuff parents pay for or the stuff you pay for and in that case be 50% your sister's ""responsibility"" but, as explained, **unless the latter figure exceeds the parent-figure, she gets to take advantage of what you basically owe your parents.** If you end up seeing that your parents contributed less than what half the 2-year commute would cost then your sister would basically just have to match the difference.

Almost everyone I knew in high school drove a younger sibling or nearby friend. 

I was in your shoes too, I was driving and my brother is 4 years younger, so he needed to ride with me to his middle school next door to the senior high I went to. I was reluctant but we had some great times doing that. He made sure I left home on time, we'd get food or collect all our coins for snowballs after school, listen to music, and goof around. When he got his car I gave him the CD we listened to every morning.

Anyway, I think you're past the age where your sister is annoying and you refuse to share. Grow up and tolerate her, have some empathy, and you might get to enjoy it. You guys are family, and you are both at a fun age. ",Human

43shte,"I don't think you're *the* asshole of the situation but you're definitely being *an* asshole.

Your sister has paid ~1/4 of the parking fee and won't contribute to gas.  Therefore, she should only be allowed to ride with you if she is ready to go before you are, meaning if you need to be at school at 6:40, she needs to be there at 6:40 if she wants a ride.  For rides to places other than school she's taking the bus.

If the gas issue can be resolved somehow, I think you should drive your sister.  Just make sure you're getting money up front.  Same thing for if you end up being asked to drive her and her friends.",Human
43shte,"Yes, you are being an asshole. You are going to the same place and your parents helped you buy this car. There is no reason you can't drive her. It's not like she can drive. Why should she take the bus when you guys are going to the same place? It doesn't make sense that it would be an issue. She shouldn't have to pay you a damn cent. Your parents already paid for your car and I am guessing you don't pay the insurance any month (no matter how big or small that payment may be). Stop acting like a 3 year old, proclaiming the world unfair because your sister gets to do something you didn't get to do. That is life. There will be different opportunities available to each of you. If you keep a tally you are going to be a bitter, shallow person.

edit: My sister and I didn't have the best relationship as teenagers, but she drove me to school with no issue. ",Human
43shte,"To give some (just a little) counterweight to all the ""yes you are"" comments: If you don't have the same schedules, it's understandable you don't want to wait for your sister, and I don't think you're the asshole in that case. But if you both need to go to the same place at the same time, what do you loose by letting her join you in the car? She even compensates a bit for the parking. Maybe not half of it, but from your perspective: You loose nothing if you let her join and you even gain 20. If she wouldn't join, everything would still cost you the same. And from your parent's perspective: They helped you pay for the car. Now there is, if you schedules line up, transport available for which they already paid (your car). There is also transport available which will cost extra (the bus). Why should they pay for the bus fare for your sister (assuming they do and she doesn't have to pay that herself) when they already paid a part of your car?",Human
43shte,"Yeah, you're being an asshole, because you're treating your sister like shit and you're being short sighted.  If you want to win in life, you start by treating people decently and with respect.  If they're family, you treat them with love.  I mean, assuming said persons aren't reprobates or toxic narcissists.  Not to mention, if you're nice to your sister, she'll tell her friends how nice you are, and in 4 or 5 years your chances of getting a date with them will have grown exponentially.  ",Human
43shte,"Yes you're the asshole. I drove my sister for a year while we were in the same school. It only makes sense, she's your fucking sister and it's not like you have to go out of your way. 

I'm assuming you live together and attend the same school. Grow the fuck up and be grateful that your parents even helped you buy a car so young. ",Human
43shte,"Yes, although I do think it is reasonable for your sister to pay half the parking fee and half of gas costs for the trip. I would be totally cool with her bearing even some financial responsibility for a portion of the car's maintenance, though that would be a bit harder to calculate. If you want to include that, go with the government's tax reimbursement per mile rate, which includes maintenance fees, and split that rate in half to determine a reasonable cost per mile that your sister ought to contribute.

My reasoning goes: your parents expect you to maintain the car and pay its expenses, so they should likewise expect her to contribute to those expenses, which is still tremendously cheaper than if she owned her own car. Otherwise your sister is getting treated differently, essentially enjoying ongoing child-like treatment, while you bear adult responsibilities that she too should begin to bear, at least if your parent's logic is applied to her in addition to you. 

Also, the actual purchase of the car is a separate matter and shouldn't be used to manipulate you into doing anything for them. After all, one day you will likely have to help them out financially as well.",Human

It's ""your"" car, you're paying for practically everything. Your parents aren't Indian Givers are they? pretty spiteful if so..

Easy fix would be moving out. But that would incur even more expenses.

I mean, the smell woke me up in the morning an absolutely reeked all over. I don't want to be a dick and tell him he can't keep his cat here but it REALLY sucks when anyone who comes in the house points out how bad it smells. Its embarrassing. ",Human

I've had two elderly cats with pee problems.  It's not fun, but they were mine and I dealt with it.

But it's not your cat doing this.  I would absolutely tell him the cat cannot stay and pee.  He should neuter the cat no matter what, but if that doesn't solve the pee problem he has to go.  Have him find a temporary other home, board him, whatever.

You'll still get your friend time with her and you'll still get to see the movie, though I have a feeling this isn't the answer you're looking for and the movie isn't really the reason you're upset. If you like her and are upset about her agreeing to go see a movie with another guy, then maybe you could try to actually make a more romantic move and offer to take her to dinner instead since she already basically has plans to see the movie (obviously do not ask to take her to dinner the same night she is going to the movies).",Human

44f5mp,"&gt;Ex messages me on Fb a month or so after and ongoing until now. Asks how I am, wanted to remain friends.. which I was ok with. 

Here's your first fuck up. You got back with your long term bf yet still keep in regular contact with an ex who you slept with during your ""break"" from the relationship? 

&gt;Nothing romantic about it. Just ""How was your day/ how are your parents"".. type deal.

Bullshit. Maybe there were no explicit messages between you two but the context alone makes it obvious that it's more than just ""friends talking""

&gt;Come to present day. Ex attempts to organize a ""trip"" to come see me/ me go see him. Sends, and I quote, ""When are you leaving that other crap behind"". 

And this part just proves that, at least for him, it obviously wasn't platonic. 

&gt;Bf sees this and flat out says I don't want you to talk to him anymore etc... 

He's more patient than I am. I'd dump you on the spot. What you are doing is an emotional affair. Sure you're not fucking the guy, but you're keeping him very close as a backup. 

&gt;I send him, and I quote, ""[Bf's name] dislikes me conversing with you.. i can see why.. i mean i did sleep with you. , anyway that and its just starting to make me realize what the fuck i did..  it's not going to happen anymore. don't worry about coming up alright."" and I sent another one straight after "" i dont want you to waste your time on me anymore""

And here's the second fuck up. The only way I could maybe get past it is if you broke it of",Human
44f5mp,"Gonna have to agree with this pokemon trainer. You're the asshole, OP.

",Human
44f5mp,"Not an asshole for giving a heads up. Frankly, you responded in the best way by making it clear there was no hope of contact/relationship in the future. A sudden no-contact scenario isn't always the best option, and it sounds like your ex may not have gotten the picture if you didn't send him those last notes.

It's more difficult to tell if your bf is being an asshole though. On one hand, it sounds like you guys hit a rough patch in your relationship, and he probably doesn't want to be reminded of that. On the other hand, he should be able to appreciate that you made your stance very clear to this other guy *and* that you *left* the other guy in order to get back with him. I suppose a lot of the verdict on him being an asshole would come down to how extremely he ""flipped his shit.""

In any case, reassure your bf where he stands and that you came back to him. And (just in case this needs to be said) don't stay in a relationship with someone you don't want to be with just because ""five years is a long time to just forget."" Make sure you're really there.",Human
44f5mp,"Oh. I can kinda see with the messages I sent to him now that you put it like that. I was genuinely doing it b/c I wanted to cease talking to him. Not just because current bf wants me to but so I wouldn't be leading Ex on while being w/ bf.
Because at first it was just making sure I was alright.. (He knows current Bf is a bit., overbearing bordering abuse hence the breakup) 

And no, it wasn't a break. We actually did stop talking to each other at all during that time. We wanted nothing to do with eachother during that time and he was than happy to be seeing someone else also. (I believe he had a one night stand, and legged it, but I could be wrong)
",Human
44f5mp,"Yeah.. we did hit a very very rough patch, as in we would go days without a simple kiss on the cheek (let alone on the lips).. and I'm a very affectionate person. I love to be shown I'm appreciated and loved, and I would hope that the person I'm with wouldn't mind my signs of affection.

Hence why we called it quits back then. I think he's become all the more 'territorial' since then too because he knows someone else will love me in a way he refuses to show.  
I do love my current bf. A lot. ..And I was on the verge of tears thinking I was just going to leave Ex ""Hanging"" so to speak. I hated thinking that he would despise me for ignoring him, even though he was offering to drive 2 hours.
I hate that people think it's a crime/ taboo to care about other people also. I'm a very nice person and it hurts me to see people upset or hurt in **any** way. 

I just want to be loved in the same respect.

44f5mp,"But you didn't say love, you said cared.. and then said ""care for everything""

Unless you feel ""love"" isn't mutually exclusive (where I would suggest an open relation and not dating people who aren't willing for open relationships), you've just inherently admitted that it's not as valuable.

If you're in it to ensure you're ""cared"" or ""caring"" you're just admitting to codependency issues.

Sounds like you don't have strong feelings for your current anymore and either explain the situation to him with hopes of resolution, or just stop wasting everyone's time including your own and end it. 

I don't think you're the asshole. I just think you're confused and scared to be on your own or hurt someone's feelings.
",Human
44f5mp,"thank you for all your advice btw. I really appreciate your trying to come to conclusion for the sake of helping me. I think it's a lot deeper, like we're emotionally connected. Even as much of an ass as he can be we both have shared some very good times together. (Well, we can both be complete asses to each other at times, which is normal for any relationship to my understanding ahaha)

Call me a bad person, but ever since the break-up I feel as though we're both distant. (Bf) Like we're too startled to go back to the level of love (not care) that we were in.. since high school... I'm quite hurt in a way. I really want to just be the same smitten teenagers we were 5 years ago. (perhaps I have MORE issues with growing up/ maturing?!?) but that's how I see it.

Going back to the main subject though. I don't believe I am an asshole because he did deserve to be told what was going on and why. Not receiving a reply in such a manner can really fuck a person up- especially if they think they've done something wrong when they haven't.

That said, you explained it to him, and he either trusts you or he doesn't.  Letting your ex know to stay home was the right thing to do.  Don't get me wrong, he would have deserved it.

but hey, if that means I'm co-dependent. So be it.(Serious) I do not make him do anything he doesn't wish to do. I am just eagerly waiting for the day he can pick himself up out of the ""fog"" and love me for who I am. (Over nice-ness and all) I love him, I love that he used to take me to the theme parks.. and way back when he found out I'd never been to a natural beach (we lived in outback qld) he and his parents took me for a swim in the ocean. He stuck by me even when my mother decided he was not ""right"" for me. He stood up for me. Told her he loved me. I keep looking back at all this and it leaves me on the verge of tears. I know the ""puppy love"" stage doesn't last forever but it wouldn't kill him to make an effort every now and again.


I'm a 21 year old female (bf is 23), studying.. and while my bf keeps tabs on me for a living right now I can only hope that my efforts don't go completely unnoticed. I love him and I want nothing more than for him to get on the right path again.

Interesting that you brought that up as an example, because reading through this I'm thinking to myself, it's all very well that this is what you ""like"" doing with people, but in order for both people to enjoy it, it has to be consensual. 

Doing what you like to people when they don't want to do that with you.... you're not going to keep friends that way. The hugging example is perfect - hugging people who don't want to be hugged is at best uncomfortable for them, and the worst case scenario with that would probably involve lawyers.

44iyrg,"By your own description of how insistent you are on having things proven beyond a doubt (aka, logically), you are the asshole. Emotional issues are not logical, and sometimes you need to suck up that you aren't wrong in interpersonal relations, but that you're still not right.

If you want to improve your discussions, try just listening. No retorts, nothing but okays, yes, alright, I see. Let them get their entire side out on the table.

Better yet, subtly mimic their body language. It makes people more relaxed and they might open up to you more because you're relating with them nonverbally. Think about what you say before you say it, then ask yourself, ""Is there a better way I can phrase this so I can still convey what I'm trying to say without making it seem confrontational?"".

I'll bet. I think many people seldom put the thought into conceptualising what it is they actually need from people, partly because it's culturally not what we tend to do. (A pity really because it would make life easier). So they're probably not good at telling you.

You sort of have to act like an anthropologist and observe people to see how they want to treat people and be treated, and which interactions they enjoy.

If your friend has been crying for hours, they're clearly emotionally distraught. It might seem silly to care so much about a fictional character, but some people do empathize with said characters so much that the death of one feels almost as legitimate as an actual death. You don't need to care about *why* she's sad, you should be caring about the fact that your friend is sad at all. There is no litmus test for how much one *should* feel about a given event, some people can get raped and not feel incredibly emotional about it while it would psychologically break some others.

Exactly what qualifies you to make this diagnosis here on the internet? This is a huge leap for you to make based on what OP has shared. Leave the diagnosing to the doctors, man. Some of us don't have autism and yet have a few situations in which we aren't properly socialized. 

If you are in fact qualified to make a diagnosis of a mental disorder, then you are fully aware that such a diagnosis cannot be made online and must be done in person. I know you're just trying to help, but you need to be careful with your arm chair psychiatry. Making assumptions about someone's mental illness online can be damaging to that person. 

I've been guilty of it myself. After taking Psych 101 most of us tend to think we know what we're talking about, but the more psychiatry classes you take the more you realize how inappropriate it is to make a drive by diagnosis with so little information.

If you think you have a mental disorder yourself, then you need to see a professional who can properly diagnose you and not make assumptions about yourself without any of the proper tools or knowledge.",Human
44iyrg,"&gt; Exactly what qualifies you to make this diagnosis here on the internet?

Nothing, which is why I never said OP was autistic. I asked if OP had considered it. Not everyone has been to a professional that *would* be capable of diagnosing them, so it's worth asking if it could be a possibility.

I don't disagree with what you're saying, but your arguing against diagnosing people online - which I never did.",Human
44iyrg,"My argument is against what could *appear* to be a diagnosis. The uninformed could have taken what you said as fact rather than speculation. I'm arguing against what we call arm chair psychiatry, which is speculating about someone's potential mental disorder without the proper skillset, which is exactly what you did. 

I hear your point, it could very well be worth asking about the possibility that OP see a professional, but in this case we had far too little information for you to make the leap to autism. It would be more appropriate to say something like ""Your communication skills don't seem to be completely within the norms of society, maybe you should seek a professional,"" rather than naming any specific disorder. By naming a disorder, an uniformed reader could think you have qualifications that you may or may not have. 

Like I said, I've been guilty of this myself. I'm still working on adjusting my methods to match my advice for you here and suggest a more gentle handed approach in the future. It's better if we don't name specific disorders, but if you think someone should see a professional it's absolutely appropriate to make the suggestion.

If you can handle confrontation (ie be polite and mature during a VERY difficult conversation) go over and talk to them (in a calm and respectful manner) when you know they're home and there's no one else around and they don't have to be somewhere else etc. and just ask them what's going on.

He should've spoken to the landlord about compensation, since it's the landlord's property that's being improved, not yours.

To clarify, you are an asshole for hanging up on your girlfriend (that one is pretty cut and dry). Hanging up on someone is just about never a smooth move. You are also the asshole if your pronoun usage to her also indicated you and joe in the ""us"" and put her as odd [wo]man out. It's going to make your girlfriend feel pretty shitty if you indicate you're closer to your friend and trust him more than her.

All that being said, your girlfriend is an asshole for trying to pit you against your good friend. She also seems like an asshole for construing a simple thing such as lost glasses as a conspiracy against her. She is also the asshole for blaming you for anything in this situation.

But to be totally honest, I doubt anything would have gone down differently were I in your position.",Human

Sounds like he's having delusions of grandeur. He's not a god. Everything doesn't happen for **his** greater good. 
In order for a relationship to work, you must both be willing to overcome obstacles- sometimes even settle on a middle ground somewhere along the line. 

If he can't do either of those things... it's not worth it. Let me tell you that. ",Human
44uq5b,"He's the asshole.

Not for telling you how he feels, though. People are all very diverse.. I suppose my advice to you would be to accept that he views your sexual pleasure as a chore (which would be difficult to accept, for me), or leave him. You can't change how he feels..

He's the asshole in this situation, though, because he didn't acknowledge *your* feelings. He played a victim and stormed out when you were trying to communicate about something that hurt you. My advice for him (if he's taking any..) would be this: When someone explains something made them feel bad, try and understand their point of view and empathize with them. Have open ears and open arms; try and reach a comfortable understanding on both ends. 

And yeah, comparing him to others isn't the best explanation, but he was being pretty ridiculous speaking on behalf of all men. ",Human
44uq5b,"Agreed. Normally you just don't compare someone to other people when it comes to performing in bed. But this guy opened himself up for it when he spoke on behalf of ""all men"". My husband would like to disagree with that point.",Human
44uq5b,"Not the asshole. You're not really comparing them both to be honest, just kind of stating the fact that other people like intimacy. ",Human
44uq5b,"You're not the asshole for comparing him.

However, he said he always initiates everything. Is that true?

If you never want sex, then I understand his view that when he wants sex, he would naturally assume you will want him to get it over with. That is to say, you don't show that you want sex, so why would he assume you wanted him to pleasure you?",Human
44uq5b,"More often than not, I do experience discomfort when I have sex sometimes, so that is fair. I do still want sex once at least every time I do see him though: he also has told me that he doesn't *mind* initiating anyway, and that he actually prefers it. So I'm pretty sure he understands that I do want him to pleasure me.",Human
44uq5b,"OK, so I'm going to disagree with everyone else here. I think comparing someone's sexual performance with someone else that you both know IS an asshole move.

44uq5b,"You're not an asshole. He is.

Sex, especially in a relationship, is give and take. Feel free to give as much as you want. Blow your guy 3x a day if you want to, but make sure your needs are met too. He better be nostril deep in that fleshy taco. If he's not pleasing you, or you're not getting something out of the relationship you need, and even after you talked about it, and he responds like that, maybe it's time to break things off.

You guys have some issues to work out now but he isn't necessarily the asshole either. Sex is a tough subject to discuss without getting hurt feelings, confused or worried.",Human
44uq5b,"Okay first and foremost, at least he is  being honest. I think a *lot* of guys feel the way he does. You can't really be mad at him for being honest,  although I guess you can be mad that he was blunt about it and you can certainly be upset at the fact he feels that way. 

 I love making girls cum. It's unbelievably gratifying.  So first off, he is wrong about that.  But there are a few conditions. 

1. As *soon* as she  acts in a way that is expectant, I'm instantly turned off by it.  If she wants me to lick her out she is more than welcome to ask  but  the minute she  acts like it's an entitlement it becomes a chore. 

2.  Everyone has the right to say they don't enjoy something.  What *do* you want him to say? Do you want him to lie about it?

 Obviously, it's a Catch-22 because you want your boyfriend to enjoy  getting you off but it sounds like he just doesn't. He's laid out his cards and it sounds like you're making him feel guilty for something he can't help.  If it's a dealbreaker, you can't put that on him -  you have to make the decision for yourself. Is this something you can live with, or something you can't? If it's something you *can* live with, then stop making him feel guilty about it.  He still  *does*  foreplay because he cares about you. It just doesn't happen to turn him on.

 Let's say you did anal with him because it's something he wants. It doesn't turn you on, but you know he likes it and you want to please him. If he got mad that you did it, but didn'",Human
44uq5b,"While I agree with your first statement, I think OP is justified here. **He** started the comparison when he made claims about all men. He paved the way for her to give counter-examples.",Human
44uq5b,"Just to play his side, although I don't personally agree with him- he doesn't get to decide what is arousing to him and what isn't. If her sexual pleasure isn't arousing to him, you can't hold it against him.

Is also doesn't sound like he thinks things happen just for his greater good- he is stating his motivations. ""I fuck you because I like sex."" Not ""You should have sex with me, because I like sex."" Big difference. He was, from the sounds of it, just stating what about sex he likes, and what he is indifferent to

And, speaking from experience- if OP's boyfriend is indeed the one initiating all foreplay, that is definitely a chore over time. Hell, it makes sex much less interesting, even for someone who gets pleasure from pleasing others. For it to be fun continuously, both partners have to contribute, and take the initiative

That said, he was pretty dumb to make a blanket statement about all guys. 

OP, if you read this? It almost sounds like you tried to apologize for not initiating. That paragraph was hard to understand for me. But I think you and the boyfriend need to discuss how to make things better- what each of you want. Don't blame each other, or say anything negative. And it isn't about what Bob and Nick enjoy. It's about what you and your bf enjoy, because that's all that is relevant to your bed. What would make sex better for you, and what would make it better for him.

Well, that's a *really* broad generalization. Our office is full of man-children, and before christmas we had full-on Nerf wars (with Charlie fully participating) until someone much older and more important decided to ban them. So I'm not disagreeing with your generalization, but I also don't feel it applies to our office.

""I let a few minutes passed, then apologized via our IM program, and said, ""Hey, sorry if I touched a nerve. I don't think you were wrong to ask us to shut the hell up yesterday."" 

A few reasons. First, you made one of those horrible non-apologies, ""sorry your feelings got hurt"". Second, although the teasing was public, the apology wasn't. In this kind of open space a sincere, public apology would mean a lot more. Finally, you exaggerated what he said in your IM as he didn't swear at you.",Human

",Human
458v1u,"NYC resident here, and I feel the exact opposite. It's pretty common practice here to make oneself as wide as possible while exiting the train if people are trying to push in before everyone exits. 'Heeey, I'm walkin here!' definitely applies.",Human
458v1u,"I've admitted to myself that its an asshole move, compared to the alternative. But I only ever do it in retaliation to deliberate and blatant disregard of rules.

458v1u,"I get that and agree with you. On the West Coast we are more likely to also yell ""coming out"".

OP didn't say people were pushing in, he said he was pushing out. Since he was talking about being mad about old people, his statement about just being careful that they weren't too old or otherwise frail is the part I disagree with.

People should 100% not block the doors or impede others on public transit. Also there is no reason to not offer up an ""excuse me"".

Clearly the downvotes show that you're are correct and the masses think I'm wrong, but I don't tolerate shennanigans from people in my way either. I also offer a bit of respect to my elders.",Human
458v1u,"Well clearly the votes (and that's what matters here) disagree with me. 

I do this as well (and when I do I'm NOT happy). I tend to go with an ""excuse me"" or two, and then look out, I'm coming through.

I have also ""accidentally"" kicked (lightly) people who completely cut me off and have ""accidentally"" put a bag in the face of someone bumping into my breasts deliberately.

My favorite passive aggressive bit is when the train is crowded enough that you'll have to sit with someone, but there are lots of choices, I always (and I mean always) pick that dude that has his legs wide and backpack on the seat. 

I'm completely comfortable calling myself an asshole for these, but I also like to think it's a bit of social justice since the trains are for everyone.",Human
458v1u,"&gt; OP didn't say people we're pushing in, he said he was pushing out

Maybe I assumed they were because of how much it pisses me off when people so this, and how often it happens here. I like the strategy of yelling to announce that you're exiting the train, however I'm not sure it would go over well here because many people use headphones to shut out the world on the trains, and for some reason people here have a strange aversion to acknowledging the existence of others with verbal communication.",Human
458v1u,"I also get very angry if people try to get in when others haven't exited the train. I will often yell ""let 'em out"" even if I don't need to exit. I find if I yell, often others will pick it up, too.

45bviq,Dude.  Get the fuck out of there while you still can.,Human
45bviq," I'm gonna go with not enough information here.

First off, if your fiance had no reason to believe that you would be irrational about a conversation, it was kind of an asshole move to just tell you how it is without discussion. She should at least explain this to you, give you a chance to talk about it. If you've given get push back on similar stuff before it doesn't clear her entirely, but it makes the water a little muddied.

When I first got married, my husband didn't get that in my family we go out of our way to help each other constantly. In a case like this if I didn't need my car every day, but my other family members did need their cars, I would do this. And I would classify a missed haircut or half a haircut as a minor inconvenience. But there is good reason for this: my family would drop important shit for me all the time. They have financially helped me out, been there when I needed help (moving, home improvement, childcare) and loaned/given me all kinds of stuff. If I can find a way to make their lives easier, then the answer is Fuck yes, even if it's annoying.

My husband's family is NOT like this. They show great annoyance at the smallest inconvenience,  including things like helping (or even just showing up) for events that are intended for the entire family. So I get that he didn't understand my family dynamic. After ten years of being in my family and seeing how nice it is to have people who have your back, he gets it. And he wants to be that person too.

So long as it's phrased like that, I don't think it's any different than telling guests ""If you would like to swim, the pool will be open from 8am until 6pm every day.""

45y58z,"I don't think what you've described makes you an asshole. From my own similar experience, I can tell you that your own expectations are to blame for your disappointment, though. People tend to act in their own self interest. If she is in a better place now, she may be avoidant of stressful/""negative"" topics for fear of slipping back into what seems like a pretty depressive state.  Not that this excuses her behavior, but it may give it context. 
You were the strong one, the shoulder to cry on, and if you're struggling now then what does that mean for her? Could be she needs you to always be hopeful and optimistic in order for her to stay on the sunny side of the street. And that is where HER expectations will cause HER disappointment. 
You are dealing with some real shit, OP. It's not unreasonable to want to get feedback about it, to hash things out with someone you trust, or even to vent about it when it gets to be too much. She might not be the person you can turn to in this situation. I hope you have other options for social support, or access to therapy (which is great for this kind of stuff). You sound like you were a friend when she was in need, and though you deserve the same, she might not be equipped to be that for you.",Human
45y58z,"No, you are not the asshole. If she is your best friend, especially after you being there for her all those times, she should be there for you, and it's really shitty of her to say something like ""be more positive,"" or complain to you that you're so 'negative' or 'hopeless.' I really don't like people who do that. ",Human
45y58z,"&gt; From my own similar experience, I can tell you that your own expectations are to blame for your disappointment, though.

I think this is a really important point. 

Not everyone has the resilience to support a friend through a tough time. Especially if she has been through some particularly difficult life events herself. Is it selfish? Perhaps. But maybe she values protecting her own mental health first, and that's OK.

Friendships aren't always 50/50 give and take. It would be nice if they were, but unfortunately it's rare.

I hope things improve for you soon.
",Human
45y58z,"Sounds like you might be gloom and doom a little more often than you think you do. There's nothing wrong with that, but recognize it. If you are constantly bumming people out, then yes, you are completely the asshole. It's also possible that you don't and they are being super sensitive about it, in which case, congrats, you aren't the asshole. It's hard to determine only hearing your side. ",Human
45y58z,"You are certainly not the asshole here. Sometimes the people we think are friends are actually incredibly selfish when it comes to emotion.

I have a friend who I was always there to help when things blew up in his face, or when he got screwed around with. I figured he'd be there for me, but he wasn't. In fact, when I got ghosted by my ex, he remained in full contact with her. He has never apologised, nor has he apologised for the other times he has been a shit to me. I've reached the point now where I just can't trust him anymore, and I actively try to avoid him when I go back to visit the town we went to university in.

I think you need to raise the issue calmly with the friend, and if they continue to be flippant and completely oblivious to YOUR needs, it's time to take a break from them. You don't need those kind of people in your life. They shouldn't expect you to be there for them if they aren't there for you.",Human
45y58z,"I'm definitely a realist, but I don't feel like I'm particularly negative about things. I tend to be very academic in evaluating situations, rather than emotional. 

One of the things May said when giving her examples of my negativity is that I have ""not been taking care of myself"" because I don't eat more than once a day. This is telling because it is something that I have discussed with her in detail, making it clear that I have no psychological aversion to eating, but have trouble because I'm getting used to having dentures, I have to take stimulants daily that kill my appetite, AND I fall asleep every time I eat (so I don't eat until I put my son to bed at night). So, the situation itself sucks. I regularly joke about it.

Maybe she is reading my realism as negativity? Or maybe she can't imagine how I can be ok when shit just obviously sucks?",Human
45y58z,"&gt;Could be she needs you to always be hopeful and optimistic in order for her to stay on the sunny side of the street.

I think you might have something there. May has always been the ""caregiver"" in our group, sitting suicide watch for a severely depressed friend, organizing the meal train when someone has surgery, etc. I've historically been the one who can give concrete solutions or at least some hard truths and a few laughs. She has typically leaned on me while everyone else leaned on her.

Now that I am in a situation that has no practical solutions other than to learn to deal with a ""new normal,"" I have been more in need of emotional support.  I expected it from her because she always gives it to others but didn't realize how much that depended on me being there for her.

I know well how to manage my expectations of people. I'm just disappointed that I have to do that now, after more than 20 years of friendship.

45y58z,"Thanks.

Sounds clichéd but empathy from internet strangers does help. I'm thinking I should get used to it, since I can't lean on my friends... /s",Human
45y58z,"Yes, you are. She doesn't owe you anything because you ""stood by her"". That's what friends are *supposed* to do. Were you just doing that because you expected something in return? She has every right to shut you out if she doesn't like your attitude.",Human
45y58z,"She's a bit of an asshole here, but there are mitigating factors. 

I've been on both sides of this coin myself, and to sum it all up: Being around depressed people is hard. Really hard. It can be really emotionally taxing. Some people have a better ability to deal with it than others. Even when you've been through it yourself, once you're through it, it's really hard to remember what it was like when you were depressed, which limits your ability for empathy towards those who do. The only thing that has stopped me from doing this with some of my depressed friends is the infinite patience they showed me when I was depressed.

So, on the one hand, it is the duty of the friend to have a reciprocal relationship where you give as much as you take. Particularly when you consider how much you did for her, it isn't unfair for you to expect the same. On the other hand, I kinda get where she's coming from. She may not have the reserves of inner strength that it takes to be able to deal with the situation well. ",Human
45y58z,"&gt; Maybe she is reading my realism as negativity? Or maybe she can't imagine how I can be ok when shit just obviously sucks?

I'm not sure (also not the person you were responding to, but jumping in anyway) but one possibility is that with chronic illness, sometimes the grief/acceptance pattern of the person with the illness is different to that of a loved one. So you might be in a place where you can be a realist (or even laugh) about something without realising that it is taking an emotional toll on the person you're talking to. So for example what for you is a joke, a way of managing the not-eating thing by laughing at yourself, may be like a punch in the gut for her - for her it could have a different emotional content, and it's that emotional content she's remembering which makes her remember it differently and as a negative conversation.",Human
45y58z,"Here's the thing about depression: It often doesn't matter that ""things look up"" for you. 

The house, the car, the husband, the adoption... None of those things actually stop a person from being depressed. I don't know her, or her situation well enough to know anything, but if she really suffers from depression, rather than her just being upset by bad news (which is not the same thing), then she very probably still is suffering. 

People who are suffering silently often don't have time, energy or patience for other people's problems, and can often project onto others what they are dissatisfied with themselves. 

No, you are not being an asshole. But I don't know enough about your friend's situation to say that she *IS* being an asshole. 

If she's not actually dealing with something like depression privately, though, then she's TOTALLY being an asshole, because that's a shitty thing to do to a friend without a damn good reason. ",Human
45y58z,"You are not the asshole here. Your best friend is someone who is supposed to be there for you through your hard times, as it sounds like you have been there for her.

We've been friends for a couple of years and there have been many, many times where it's just so painfully obvious that no words are needed... Although they have occurred in varying levels of subtlety. It's practically a tacit mutual understanding that it's the case. This is why I don't want to talk to him about it. We both know that he's into me, and we both know that I'm not into him.

Also, I know that smiling isn't a 'fuck me' sign, lol. But it's not just a smile. All of my housemates smile and laugh with eachother most days but it's the way it occurs. It's the way a girl might look longingly at some guy she really likes in a daydreaming sort of way.

On your point about if a girl friend of mine was doing the same thing, there were 2 girls I lived with in my first year of Uni who actually did do pretty much the same thing. One of them told me over the Summer holidays via text that she loved me (wasn't love though - she's just immature) and the other one came onto me while we were on a night out with the rest of my housemates that year. Unfortunately, they both had boyfriends who I was friends with, so I basically told them both to cut it out and not mention it again or I'd tell their boyfriends. That sucked because one of them was probably my best friend at uni at the time. We're still friends but we did fall out terribly for a period because of it.

That's not the problem here though. 

The problem is that he is making you uncomfortable with his actions, not that he has feelings that you don't reciprocate. 

You might both know that he likes you, but that you're straight and won't ever feel the same way, but that doesn't mean that you're on the same page about what is and isn't appropriate behaviour. 

He might understand that you will never like him back, but he might enjoy having what he thinks is a playful, flirtatious back and forth with you, and he might think that you're okay with that as long as it doesn't go anywhere. 

If his actions are making you uncomfortable, talk to him about his actions, specifically. Use examples, and make it clear that this is NOT about him being gay, or his feelings for you.

- the brown is really too dark to be a background color.

To be honest, I do web design/graphic design for a living, so it's like asking a professional photographer if they like your photo of a sunset; it may be just fine, but you have the wrong audience.

46d6qk,Nah this is a perfect example of a toxic friend. Someone who only brings you down and doesn't add to your friendship (He might have before but it doesn't seem like it now). He decided that their 'relationship' was over and that nothing else was to come. If they were just coming out of a long term relationship that would be one thing.

If they both have feelings for each other (regardless of their ideas on the reality of them being able to act on this feelings) then at best, you were severely ill-advised to make a move, and at worst, a bit of an asshole, 1.

However, as you said you didn't plan hooking up. One might argue that you should have told Matt after it had happened, so it wouldn't catch him off guard or so that he wouldn't have to hear it from someone else.

Frankly, I've never understood why people consider a friend's ex off-limits. When I broke up with someone but still have feelings for them, then that's my fucking problem and I have to deal with it - I mean, I couldn't keep a stranger from dating my ex just because I still have feelings for them, so why hindering my friends?! It's a ridiculous ""I can't have them, so you can't have them either"" scenario which is childish.",Human
46d6qk,"Ahh, high school drama. 

I really think everyone is an asshole in this situation.
Matt is an asshole, because it's obvious that he has feelings for Taylor, but for some reason, doesn't want to take her out, and for acting like a twat about it. 

Taylor is an asshole for hooking up with Matt and then hooking up with you

If she's hot you gotta just go for it man. Real friends forgive over girls. Especially after you two end up breaking it off. Then you can reconnect over it.

Your not an asshole if she's hot. You just have to look your buddy dead in the eye and say ""Dude, I can't help what she did to you. It was going to be me or some other guy. And honestly, she's bangin. I can't be held responsible. Have you seen that ass?""

Don't worry, OP, it's not you.

Your husband needs to step up and be a father. He needs to take some time to care for and bond with his daughter. He needs to be attentive to your needs, and be a better partner by working together with you.

I would preface this by saying that I am assuming that you have already told him about the situation and what's going on because of it. If you haven't, you really should. Even if you have, maybe reinforcing what is going on will help him understand that you're not trying to push everything off on him, but that you simply cannot be doing as much as normal because of your medical situation.

I know that when two people have been in a relationship for a long time, and especially if one is in a great deal of pain, communication can occasionally (and understandably) be taken for granted a little bit, and things are either left unsaid, or are said in a way that may unintentionally upset the other person. If your husband is a reasonable and loving partner and father, and you say basically what you have said here in a neutral and empathetic way, focusing on what you think and feel about the situation and your feelings, rather than on what you feel he has done wrong (except the part about him ""doing a favor by being a parent"", which may come off accusatory and as an insult to his parenting skills in general), then he should understand and be willing to help. If he is a good man, he will want to help the mother of his child in her time of need. If, however, you communicate openly and empathetically, and your husband is still unwilling to help and care for your daughter evenly, then yeah he would definitely be an asshole.

My cousin was in a similar situation with her husband coming from a very traditional, conservative household.

46ipfi,"Not the first time, really. I mean. We have a division of labor that I'm not ENTIRELY unhappy with. I could use a bit more time to myself, but I know part of that is just a matter of me deciding to take that time (going for manicures, getting my hair done more often, etc.)

He gets her up in the morning, changes her, feeds her, and lets her play independently for a while so that I can sleep in. I'm NOT a morning person.

I get up and spend the rest of the day (until 5-6) with her playing, grooming, doing activities, etc.

In the evening, we hang out together. We do bedtime together. etc.

But as I said, when it comes to shopping... I take her 99.9% of the time. She rides in the cart with me while I look at things/shop. He looks at the stuff he wants or needs to look at. Sometimes he'll check out with his items and go to the car. Sometimes he'll sit at the front of the store in a coffee shop or snack bar.

He has absolutely no patience for shopping... even though it's not like we do it super often. I order the majority of our groceries online and have them delivered, but there are occasions when we need to go to a proper store.

46ipfi,"I think he does take her a fair amount. I mean. As I said in another comment, he could stand to do so a bit more... and I could LET him do so a bit more (by taking more time for myself). I also really DO appreciate that he takes her in the mornings when I am basically unable to function. lol.

Just in this instance, in terms of being responsible for her during shopping trips... and being responsible for her when I was feeling particularly unwell.... I felt like he was not being fair.",Human
46ipfi,"Yeah, that's pretty dangerous territory as you're probably aware. Don't ever bring up that you think his parents' relationship is dysfunctional (even if it clearly is). He'll either figure it out on his own or he won't, but there's no way you can convince him on that issue.

All you can do is explain to him how you think a family should work and what you expect from him. Give him time to think about the whole thing. If he's a reasonable man, he'll come around eventually, even if it takes time. It's not easy to turn away from your parents' ideals and realize that they were wrong about things.",Human
46ipfi,"Oh, he knows that the way his parent's relationship operates is not healthy. It's not anything he's not said before... that we've not lamented together.

Actually, I haven't told the whole story with my cousin. She's partially at fault too, because she doesn't like to give up control or responsibilities. For example, when he's somewhere alone with the kids, she keeps calling and checking in on them. And whenever there's an important decision (like kindergarten choice), she always has the last word.

I do agree with one of the other posters that you should not be keeping this stuff in your room. If you have enough of it that you can't easily hide it, then you should either have a safe place to store it or be moving somewhere that you don't have to worry as much.

The thing I'm mainly concerned about is that I told him I don't want to talk about anything related to it anymore (as it borders close to our disagreement in principles).

The main reason of not wanting to talk about it anymore is that I'm tired of hearing things and I hate not being able to be a supportive friend since I disagree what he's doing.

It does have the by-product of him not being able to have someone to talk to about these things anymore. But it's his choice to let me be the ONLY one to know about this. So I don't think I should feel bad because of that. Please tell me if there's something wrong with this reasoning.",Human

But, your actual question used the word BECAUSE... if you want him to stop talking about it BECAUSE you're not ok with him being bi, him not coming out to others, then yes... you're an asshole for that.  Still doesn't mean you should be subjected to shit you don't want to hear about... and doesn't make you an asshole to ask him to stop.  Just leave out the reason why and say I don't enjoy talking about this topic, which is true.",Human
46syyi,"I initially felt like I was being a bad friend for ""banning"" discussion of topics that make me uncomfortable. But what I get from your comment is that: if I don't want to hear about something regardless of reason, I could just ask him to stop and that's fine.

This solves my issue. Thanks.",Human
46syyi,"I don't think there's anything wrong with that reasoning.  He's saying he's fine being in the closet, but the change in your conversational topics indicates he *does* want someone who is accepting to know the true him.  I think the whole ""pressuring"" thing is where /u/iamaneviltaco finds fault, and the only place I can see you over reacting.   
  
  What I mean by over reacting is that in a normal friendship, you'd be willing to chat a bit (as you said) as long as it didn't dominate your relationship.  One could certainly argue that this kind of total restriction is rational, as you hopefully already attempted to just minimize the amount of guy-focused chatter, and your friend ignored those requests. But I think the middle ground (i.e. path to NOT being the Asshole) is to tell him he's welcome to talk to you about guys, to a certain degree, and when you say ""I've talked enough"", he has to respect that.  If he can't, then it's more about the principle of friendship, instead of any other principles.  Friends should be willing to accommodate their friends.   
   
Sorry to go on so long, last thing - completely cutting him off might have the adverse effect, of suggesting non-heterosexuality is hard or bad to talk about.  Letting yourself discuss it with him a little bit will both assure him it is more natural (and help him feel more comfortable outside the closet), and you may be able to point out evidence that supports your principle.

It may be possible for him to be perfectly happy in the closet, especially if he is dating girls and/or planning to live as ""straight"". That's none of your concern. What IS your concern is that you're getting a limited version of friendship based on his secret.",Human

Try looking at it from your sisters point of view. There is zero incentive in putting anything back to how you like it for her apart from not having to listen to the ear ache. It may be you leave the cereal box with the lid off or some other micro vexation that winds her up and this ticks a r/pettyrevenge box for her.

 I have a similar argument with my girlfriend, she will accuse me of being lazy for leaving the seat up. She'll say ""it takes no effort to put it down"". Well I say she's the lazy one. I did my bit by not pissing all over the seat, the price she pays for a dry botty is putting it down.

In terms of inhaled Radon and other radioactive gases, second-hand smoke is orders of magnitude worse than first-hand smoke.

Radon particles deposited in the lungs is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S., cigarette smoking being the 1st. Of the latter, 9-14% of lung cancer development in smokers is directly attributed to the effects of deposited Radon.

You are not his parent. Why do you think you get to decide how he drives, or what speed he drives at? 

You may not take it as a valid argument, given how strident and sensitive you are to this issue, but he does in fact have a point. Often, police won't even bother stop drivers going less than 10 mph (17km/h) over here in the US, because it's not really unsafe. Speed limits are to reinforce safe driving. It's not like 100km/h is perfectly safe but 101 km/h you are suddenly dangerously out of control.

You don't get to decide or tell him how to drive. Period. You don't get to scold him. If you don't want to pay his traffic fines, dont. Let him learn HIS lessons, don't berate him with the ones YOU want him to learn.

You being overly sensitive about speeding is YOUR issue to deal with. Don't project that on to him. You may be worried about him, but it's not a reasonable worry  (given what you've described). That, again, makes it YOUR problem.

It'll be harder for him to shrug it off if you make it clear speeding is emotionally traumatizing for you.

But stop paying his tickets, and make it clear you're not driving him to work/school/etc. if he loses his license due to speeding tickets.

A healthy relationship isn't one where each partner completely subjugates their free will and individualism to the other's desires. You take into account the other's feelings, yes, but if you don't agree, the partner has no right to impose or nag their preference onto you. Which is what OP seems to me to have done.

OP stated his case to the partner. Partner doesn't agree. Healthy boundaries would thus imply that discussion is largely over. OP can't then just play the ""well it affects me too"" trump card to get his way. Even if OP was 100% correct  (which I don't believe), he STILL doesn't get to impose that view on his partner.

Go the fuck back to NV then.  You can't help your grandma.  Staying and taking abuse doesn't help her, does it?",Human

47eqxj,I'm a little confused about how you were able to afford the tickets to Germany while your mother had to pay for the tickets to Trinidad? If you can't afford all of the cost for one vacation why in the world would you start paying for another?,Human
47eqxj,"I couldn't afford the tickets at the time as it was right after the holidays and at the end of the month.  I could have made the money for the tickets to Trinidad in about a week with my job, but my mom offered to buy them instead. When I bought the tickets to Berlin, I had the money saved up.  ",Human
47eqxj,Maybe you should have payed your mother back for the ticket she bought you instead of planning another trip? Maybe she's feeling taken advantage of?,Human
47eqxj,Did she actually refund the tickets? Or did she just threaten to do so?,Human
47eqxj,"She specifically said the ticket was a 20th birthday gift, so I never assumed she wanted me to pay her back.  Her reasons for refunding them are supposedly that she's now concerned about my safety. ",Human
47eqxj,"According to her, the tickets are refunded.  I looked on the flight company's website and apparently you have fill out a form to have your flight tickets refunded but it is possible. ",Human
47eqxj,"Sounds like your mom gave you this gift with strings attached (my way or the highway!) If it wasn't the trip to Berlin it would have been something else you did that she didn't approve of and want you to ""correct"" your behavior to fit her narrative. 

I don't see you as the asshole. 

Edit: typos",Human

47eqxj,"Call the flight company and double check. Plus I would also explain the situation, be honest and heartfelt. People who work in customer service are just people and genuinely want to help. So there might be something they can do, like find you a deal for a cheap flight. It might not be possible. But it is always worth asking.

P.s. you are NOT an asshole.",Human

47gzen,You are not an asshole for not enjoying her company but you would be if you frame it to her the way you did to us. ,Human
47gzen,"&gt;She must be autistic or something like that

I think you're an asshole just going off this statement alone. 
Not only that, you are incredibly rude for making such a shallow snap judgement. You should not make this statement unless you are 100% sure that she is or isn't. 


I think the best way to resolve this would be to tell her your thoughts and that you do not appreciate her crude or inappropriate social advances and next time she attempts to steal your food you tell her no and that you do not share food. Simple. ",Human
47gzen,"Ask her nicely but firmly to go away. I think that's the best you could do, be tactful. I don't think that you are an asshole because you aren't enjoying her company. ",Human
47gzen,"Oh calm down tumblr. Autistic people are known for having communication difficulty so that assumption is reasonable. OP didn't say ""I think she has autism, eww!"" she just offered it as a possible reason for why she's unable to pick up on the cues that her and her friends don't enjoy her company. If anything, I find your kid-gloves approach to autism far more offensive, like people who say ""I don't see color"" when talking about race. Get off the high road.",Human
47gzen,"You're not the asshole yet but I can tell this is annoying you a lot and if you let it continue you're probably going to let your frustration out in a bad, assholish way. 

I'd say be firm with her and don't let her coast on social niceties. Let her know when she's bothering you in a clear way and with a calm tone. If she persists then you might have to be more blunt and just tell her to leave you alone but if you handled everything else right you can do that without being an asshole.

Good luck OP",Human
47gzen,"I don't see her in a negative light because she has autism. Rather I was trying to explain why she acts the way she does and why I feel even more like an asshole. My mother is actually a special ed teacher and I've baby sat kids that genuinely do have autism. I don't have anything against them. Rather, it's a matter of giving you guys more context. I can see how that may come off as offensive but I didn't intend it that way",Human
47gzen,"op is still an asshole for making that specific assumption based on otherwise normal things this person does. 


If op is verbally saying this to their friends, it is in fact school yard bullying and a very sad and wrong thing to do. And in the real world, this could be taken as slanderous (see libel, defamation) and you could very well be charged accordingly. 


Oh and please (politely) read the subs rules /u/DrProbably. This was an unfortunate misunderstanding on your behalf but that's alright, I understand as it it can be quite difficult to understand where a person is coming from on the internet. ",Human
47gzen,Ok but I wouldn't say that to her. I'm not an idiot. And it's not normal things. She doesn't understand social cues at all,Human
47gzen,"OP I don't think you're an asshole for having those feelings. I don't think anyone can really be deemed an asshole for something they just *think.*

However, this person might actually be autistic. I used to know a guy that was JUST like this. He just didn't realize that all the things he was doing were annoying. You could tell him things like, ""It's time to stop talking now."" or ""It's time to stand somewhere else now"" and he'd comply, but he didn't really understand why, either. It was very strange. Maybe gather a little more info about this person, OP. They might not be doing it on purpose.",Human
47gzen,"I didn't misunderstand anything.

 There's nothing in the rules about any of this. 

You're a condescending asshole.",Human
47gzen,"&gt;that genuinely do have autism.

This only leads me to think that A)you should be able to recognize autism straight off the bat rather than make assumptions as you did B) She doesn't *actually* have autism, and you know that. Yet you make such remarks for relative context (which, fair enough) simply a wrong choice of wording perhaps? 


Look, the girl is annoying asf to you and your friends, you coulda just said it plain and simple. You don't like her as a person and think you're maybe a ""different crowd"" as to what she would be suited to. I think you simply need to let her know and this will have all but disappeared from thought. 


Good luck",Human
47gzen,Thanks. This exactly the advice I'm looking for ,Human

You might be in for a shock dude",Human
47gzen,"Oh ok fair enough, so maybe approach staff and explain that you feel she should be put in another area/ taken away from your group because you're not really willing to associate with her for said reasons. I'm sure seu or what have you would be totally 100&amp; supportive of this and take action. ",Human
47gzen,"Look I feel like this may be something close to your heart. I'm sorry that I've offended you. But I truly believe that she is autistic. She doesn't know boundaries or understand when it's appropriate to talk or say the right things. Now I'd understand if you said I should be nice because she doesn't understand. If you think I'm an asshole because I'm tired of dealing with her, that's fair. But I'm not an asshole for acknowledging her legitimate mental illness. I say it only for context",Human
47gzen,"Thanks for understanding where I'm coming from. I appreciate it. I don't believe in being overly pc about this. This girl is autistic, I'm positive of that",Human
47gzen,"OP is not a doctor trained in the diagnosis of autism. While he has experience with autistic children, that doesn't make him an expert in a medical sense (he could in theory be called as an expert witness in court, but the standard there is that one has a ""more than layperson"" understanding of the subject) and it is certainly unreasonable to expect that he be able to tell right away whether or not someone else is autistic. It would be unreasonable to expect a fully trained medical professional to be able to tell right away, much less someone with no medical training.

I would be inclined to give OP's assumption much more merit than your tumblrizing however, as he has experience with autistic children more than a layperson. He has some idea of what comes with the condition, and is drawing a conclusion based on his experiences. While I agree that the choice of words in ""kids that genuinely do have autism"" was not the best, I think that what OP meant was that the kids he babysat had a known diagnosis of autism, and that the girl in the post does not have such a known diagnosis.",Human

47gzen,"&gt;She sits with my friends and me at lunch. She is constantly taking food without asking, interrupting us, getting way too close, following us everywhere, and not taking any hints when we tell her that that isn't ok.

Is it just her? All the stuff you've described as ""annoying"" is what I think most friends do without even thinking about it. What is it about her specifically that you don't like? Are you embarrassed by her? Do you guys have nothing in common? 

In any case, I don't think you're an asshole for wanting her to leave you alone. Sometimes people don't click. Just don't let it get into asshole territory by being rude or ostracizing her. Maybe just start to say hi when you see her, but start to minimize contact and see if she finds someone else. I'm not sure how you can get her to back off without specifically saying that you don't want to be friends. If you do, put it in terms of ""we don't have anything in common"" or ""I think I'm just too busy for another friend right now.""

47qdpx,"More info about the cat my parent's kept. Her name in Kendra and my grandmother told me she used to hide in her closet all day. She was the first cat we found and she was really skinny even though all her other animals were obese. She never hid in the closet at my parent's house, she stayed in the open. My mom told me when my grandmother was leaving and putting her cat's in the crates, Kendra was literally skipping in joy. She somehow knew all the other animals were going and she got to stay. When I came back last night, she was sleeping sprawled out on the couch. She seemed to gain weight and more affectionate then before. 

I am going to guess she was afraid of all the other animals in my grandmother's house and would only eat when it was quiet. Eat as little as she could then run. When she came to my parent's house, there weren't as many animals and the house was a lot bigger. I guess I am happy that at least some living creature got a happy ending to this event. ",Human

Perhaps your group is more of the ""Asshole"" in this situation due to them not backing up your claims properly. If you all expressed your worry maybe he would realize he needed to contribute more and step up the game. 


I'd also like to suggest that you give him another ""chance"" by letting F proof/ edit the body of work so far for general errors. Perhaps he can spot a few errors and up your grade. If he can't contribute to editing, especially of the end product (that you all worked hard on), I feel that he shouldn't get any credit at all.",Human

How does that work in practice?",Human
47yygk,"Well, people can't know what they don't know. If he completed all of the tasks that you gave him, and you never told him that he wasn't meeting expectations, then what was he supposed to do? Read your mind?

I think it's fine that you told him he wasn't producing as he should be. More than okay...there's no other way for him to know. Now that he knows, he should be held to the same standard as everyone else. 

You said that he's enthusiastic, but you wind up babysitting him. Perhaps this is a chance to evaluate your own leadership skills. Every team needs one. Have you adequately explained the project and expectations to every team member? Does each person understand their role and what that entails? Instead of just assigning tasks to him to keep him busy, maybe explain to him how he can learn more on his own to help contribute to the team. Not every person on every team will have the same set of skills and the same knowledge base as every other person. 

I'm not saying you're an asshole. I'm just saying try to imagine how you would feel if you were part of a team and were lost (maybe not as bright as the other team members) and no one was explaining anything to you, but you did what they asked and one day somebody flips shit because you're not the strongest member.

2fkgww,"Thanks I agree that's why I sent the email that I did instead of flipping out on her aside from the fact that being a rude ass doesn't really accomplish much. 

I'll probably update the thread when she emails me back but I live in SC and this is one of the best well known attorneys in the area so I'm kind of shocked at this. 

But that being said they are making thousands of easy dollars off of me. I forgot to mention it but there was an off duty police officer in his patrol car who saw the whole thing who is willing to testify on my behalf so it's a slam dunk case 

I mean that and there was a couple that was behind the drunk idiot on another road before she hit me and was already on the phone with 911 reporting her drunk ass about 5-10 minutes before she hit me and they stopped as well and gave their statements to the officer 

I don't see how much more open and shut this could be?",Human
2fkgww,So I sent that email to her at 12:18 EST and it's now 5:30EST so they are closed and I have no response this to me is no ok there is no reason why a paralegal can not return an email within 5 hours. ,Human
2fkgww,"I suppose the charitable explanation here is that when she typed ""Progressive"" in her email to you, she meant ""Allstate."" I mean, we all have those brain fart moments. If that's all it was, I'd say it's no big deal. If she did in fact contact the wrong provider on your behalf, then yeah, I'd say that's grounds for firing. 

Either way, you're not an asshole for deciding to work with a different lawyer. It's your right to get the representation you want. But you might want to double-check any representation agreement you signed with her first to make sure you can get out at this point without owing her anything (or if you will owe her something, how much that is). ",Human
2fkgww,"24 hours is generally the standard for email response time. With all due respect, you're not her only client. And maybe the paralegal can't reply because she doesn't know the answer to your question. Maybe she's waiting on a response from the lawyer.

Point is, you may have good reason to fire your lawyer, but I don't think the email response time is it.",Human
2fkgww,Ok thanks I appreciate it and you're right I may have been too quick to judge on the tone frame but I only say that because mostly every time I have emailed them I have gotten a reply back within a few hours but I guess we'll see ,Human

2fkgww,"Wow, with that kind of evidence, I would think your attorney would be much more responsive.  It sounds like a slam dunk and you could get a nice settlement without having to go to trial.  

It sucks you're probably going to have to wait until Monday to get an answer, so I wouldn't fire her yet.  You probably can't anyway if you signed a contract, unless there's gross negligence.",Human
2fkgww,Well see that's what I'm unsure about I signed a contingency agreement but that was it so I think I could still leave but even if not I definitely would be able to get a different lawyer at the same firm ,Human
2fkgww,"I work for a lawyer so I may seem bias, but mistakes happen. It isn't as though your information was sent to some random person off the street. It was sent to a company that understands confidentiality. That letter was more than likely shredded. 

We do personal injury. I had to get medical records from a hospital for a client. Got someone else's records mixed in. I could've created a shit storm at the hospital for that. Instead, I called the records department to let them know another patient's records were in my client's records and I would shred the other. These things happen. 

Not receiving an email reply right away, yeah, it's irritating, but sometimes the lawyer is in court or swamped with clients. My office (one lawyer, 3 support staff) has had 80 new clients just since January. That's not including all the other files from last year or the year before still ongoing. 

The end of the day, it's your decision whether to remove your lawyer. Just bear in mind, if you do, her fees/disbursements spent this far will become due. ",Human
2fkgww,"Thanks for the insight it's actually the paralegal that I have been speaking to not the lawyer and I know that progressive will almost certainly trash my info I'm less mad about that and more mad about the fact that it's a waste of time I have spent so much money out of pocket already and have nothing to show for it 

it's just a little frustrating when mistakes like this happen especially in an environment and a profession that is supposed to be so professional and client oriented the email response I understand it was Friday and they are closed on the weekends so she most likely wasn't going to get back to me.

If you want advice, I'd say establish your boundaries. Say what you are willing to do with him, and what you're not okay with. Followed up with something positive. It will make the conflict easier for him to swallow.

My personal thinking is if you stayed together, he will only become increasingly tortured and unhealthy about this. You will feel terrible guilt all the time; and his esteem could take a real hit.

2fnf78,"You're kind of assuming what's bothering him and why he's acting differently. There are a lot of nuances and aspects of any relationship; you don't *know* he's being quiet or passive aggressive because of your sex work. It could be any number of things. It might not even be about you, is anything else going on in his life that could be stressing him out? Maybe try talking to him. 

If you don't try to talk to him about what's bothering him, and really listen to what he has to say, that part kind of makes you an asshole on its own. ",Human
2fnf78,Agreeing to the prearranged conditions can change when emotions are involved,Human
2fnf78,"Have to agree with /u/rosinal.  No one was the asshole.  You were being really optimistic, but I have to believe it's possible you can have both a fun sexual relationship with a boyfriend, and have this job.   However, with your current man, things are likely to get worse and worse, because he's gotten more serious about you than your situation allows for.   If he's having trouble and denying it, I don't think he's being an asshole; he's just trying to keep his word and act like he's still cool with it.  ...which will only make him more unhappy and probably resentful over time.   It doesn't sound like it makes sense for you to stop doing this type of work any time soon, so I think you both have only two options.  

(1) Talk as equals and consider breaking up now.  This will hurt and make you both feel terrible for a while, but maybe he'll find being with you is more important than his hang-up and work past it, or maybe you'll end it as friends.  Ultimately this will allow you the freedom to look for what you really want...and it possible you'll get back together years later when your lifestyles match, if that's what you want.

(2) Wait for it to get contentious and start fighting until one of you has had enough and leaves.  This will be worse in the short term and long term.",Human
2fnf78,I guess maybe. I've had long term open relationships in the past (2+ years) that worked fine and only fell apart due to geography. Obviously with sex work involved this is a different beast - I guess the question is if it is possible at all to date and do sex work,Human

2fnf78,"That's a very good point that I may be overlooking something entirely - that his current mood as being 'off' may be entirely separate.

2fnf78,"I really appreciate the time you took to articulate the problem you see so first let me just say thank you.
      It's hard for me to accept, but I think the options you laid out are all there is to do IF I am unable to help him overcome his insecurities. Thanks to some of his friends divulging stories of his past, I've come to realize that commitment is really hard for him because he is terrified of losing whatever he commits to. His past has lent him to cynicism in relationships. I need to make him realize that I love him and want a future with him just as he is - and that nobody will 'win me away' from him. I guess the question is how..",Human
2fnf78,"Plus it helps to share more details of interactions with the regulars or the ones he gets quiet and emo about. Specifically showcasing that they have a physical but not emotional bond with you.

Best you extract the truth from the horses mouth.",Human
2fnf78,"&gt; the question is how

Yeah that's tough. Only thing I can think of is proposing lol. Which, needless to say, is a shitty idea. Good luck with it!
",Human
2fnf78,I would sit down and have a talk with him about what your goals are both for the relationship and for your lives in general. The open relationship may have worked for him in the beginning but he may have changed his mind now that you have been together longer. It's not an easy situation and you need to talk directly to him about it. You may find out that you have different relationship goals and even if you like each other it may not work out in the long run. ,Human
2fnf78,"You're right.  If you can overcome the fact that he is no longer comfortable with your job, or other guys you might want to be with on the side, you have no need to consider my options.

But I'm at a loss for how you could solve that problem for him especially if you still want OTHER non-professional hook-ups on the side.  He's at a point where he thinks you're enough for him and he doesn't want anyone else.  Clearly, he wants that from you whether he'll admit it or not.  So, I'm putting your job aside based on the idea that you only want/need to do it for professional reasons--I know you said you enjoy it--and I'm left with you being a relationship with a guy who wants monogamy, but you still want things to be open.  I fully admit that he is the one who changed, not you, but I don't see how you two belong together if you can't at least tell him he's special enough to swear off random hookups.  Being faithful doesn't mean you never have desires again.  It means your partner satisfies you enough, and you care enough, to put those needs aside for his benefit.  It sounds like he wants that kind of relationship, and you don't.  So, ""solving the problem"" means changing the kind of person he is, or somehow downgrading the way he feels about you.  ",Human
2fnf78,"Thank you for your insights. I think I should swear off random hookups then, it's definitely worth saving my relationship. Sadly I don't know if that would actually work. That doesn't fix his insecurities - it just alleviates a place where they pop up",Human

It is unfortunate that you won't see your partner for a couple of weeks, but the fact that you feel that this has anything at all to do with you is pretty funny.

As it stands, your brother is obviously the asshole. He has no respect for other people's things and he's apparently a liar.  Someone should make him pay, but if you make him pay, you're just going to start a cycle of vengeance.

You should probably apologize and explain that you didn't mean to take the banter over a line that hurt her feelings, and if some of her lines do hurt your feelings too, that would be the time to bring that up. I also suggest taking the initiative and telling her you're going to take it upon yourself to no longer engage in conversations like that during band practice, because it mixes your friendly and professional roles, and you realize putting her under stress can compromise her position of authority when she's responsible for leading other people.

It's high school, as long as you do well enough to get into a good college, you'll be fine.

But, if he knows the other kid copied his work/test, and he didn't agree to let him, he has all the excuse he needs in my book.  Suppose two kids turn in work that has the same extremely unique and stupid mistakes on it because one copied the other.  Both will be in trouble, because cheating is against any school's rules and helping someone else cheat is always also against any school's rules, so the teacher almost always won't care who copied who because she'll assume the one who supplied the answers helped the other cheat or at least knows about it and did nothing.

Nor does their offer strike me as problematic.  The review system not only protects future buyers, it gives you some leverage to make the seller offer you fairer terms than they might if they had no fear of reprisal. 

However, it sounds like you made a lot of assumptions about what ""expedited"" means.

It can still be gross and fattening as hell, but as long as there's another version of the product that is worse, you can call it it ""low fat"".)  Similarly, I imagine that there was a cheaper and slower standard of shipping that this seller usually does (i.e. letting it sit for a week before sending 3rd class mail), so the fact that he paid FedEx to pick up is literally expedited.  Did you have any reason--other than your own preconception of what fast shipping is--to expect a faster service?

Your father describing your walk as gay isn't offensive. 

If he said it in a way that implied disgust like, ""How dare you walk in that way"". Then yes, it would be. But from you describe in a comment, your father isn't homophobic.

Of course he's going to be offended and pissed off (and *hurt*) that you think he was intending to be discriminating or homophobic. So yes, you are that guy that nit picks.

I'm sorry to say this, but walking with ""flair"" or ""flamboyancy"" *is* a part of the gay scene. To say it isn't is just blind. To many gay people that is their identity.

On the other hand, you don't sound like a bad son, but you also clearly have some issues that play into the dynamic of your relationship (Oversensitivity, immaturity, maybe just a little bit of entitlement?) and you probably trigger him in all kinds of ways just like he's triggering you.

Beyond that, the way you played the argument was totally off. I'm a 28 year old queer and I would scoff if you said ""micro-aggressions"" to me. To a lot of people of older generations, that word sounds beyond made-up.

You can be annoyed at his lack of social progress and understanding of current gender theory, **or you can just be his son and love him and ask for his love in return and make him want to school himself**. In my experience the second tactic has worked much better.

Despite the fact that we, as a country, are a collection of some of the wealthiest people in the world, it's still a statistical fact that there are going to be transients/homeless people.

It's foolish to say that every homeless person is criminal scum, but it's equally foolish to say that they're all just victims of circumstance and that none of them have made and continue to make decisions that put them in that position.

If you want my basic life philosophy (you don't, but I'm incredibly bored and am snowed in) then I'm probably a socialist or even a communist. I think that it's more important to provide a basic standard of living for everyone than to allow certain people to be extremely wealthy while others suffer. Truthfully, I think that's the only political philosophy that a deeply compassionate person could have.

That said, there are people who are scum. We don't like to say it, but that's how it is. There are people who would abuse a system even with everything provided to them.

Not strictly. Public means public, you're allowed to expect a certain standard. I can't do whatever I want on public transportation, nor can I in a public place.

**For *hating* homeless at the library?**

If you literally hate them, yeah that's pretty harsh. You could even be enraged by them without hating them. If the root of the matter is just that you expect more, I guess that's pretty much OK. Literal hate seems pretty disproportional however. That's like *literally hating* panhandlers. Just a weird thing to get so bent up about.

**For feeling that they have come to the wrong place, when there are shelters nearby?**

Again, not necessarily. But then, that's assuming they don't spend part of the day at the shelter. This man could have slept the night at the shelter, then got up and made his way to the library. It might be the nicest place in his whole life that he has access to. That's sad, don't you think? If that's his whole life, I don't know if it's really worth getting so upset.

First thing is there is no where to take a damn shower when you are on the street. The shelters that do have them, they are usually only for a single sex and are dangerous as hell. Shelters are often not open in-between meal times. You can't just hang out in there indefinitely. I used to wash my armpits out in the Greyhound bus station, it didn't really do the job but it was quite literally the best I could do.

Maybe you don't view her heart defect as serious, or maybe you think she exaggerates it, but apparently that is who she is and what she needs.

2yjcbz,"Absolutely not. Especially in art school, networking and connections mean *everything*. That is how artists get opportunities (Whether it's a small freelance job, to an internship, this is how many professionals survive in this type of industry).

She was absolutely unprofessional by:

1. Not responding and ignoring you, therefore pushing you to attempt to connect with her again and... 

2. Not denying you. If she felt uncomfortable with recommending you, she should have said so from the get-go. You can't read her mind. If someone doesn't respond to an email, half the time professors forget to respond or it's in their spam box. How are you supposed to know what she's thinking? 

3. Not understanding her position as a *professor*. Getting you jobs, internships, connections, projects... this comes with the territory. Especially at art school where so much work is temporary anyway. She's supposed to be guiding you.

You should talk to your head of department. Print out the emails, explain the situation. If you present this calmly, it doesn't need to escalate if you don't want it to. But her accusing you of harassment is a *very* serious thing and you should treat it like such. You need to present your side to your department before she reports you (or honestly, gossips about it... because some art school teachers are not as professional as others).",Human
2yjcbz,"You tried to get ahead and your professor just didn't respond, you're fine. She could have handled it a little better, but oh well!

I think I should be fine as long as I maintain a distance from her.",Human
2yjcbz,"Sending someone two emails is hardly harassment. You're not the asshole.

I think she was really unprofessional. She mentioned the internship to you in the first place. If she regretted offering it then she should have wrote back and said something like, 'I'm sorry, but my friend at the newspaper and I just don't think that you're ready for this yet. Maybe next year! Keep up the hard work. As per your other inquiry: I only write letters of recommendation for students moving onto grad programs. Hope to see you in one of my classes again!' Or something! You don't just ignore the emails when you were the one who dangled that carrot in front of a student's nose in the first place.

I don't think that you were the asshole, OP, unless there was a great deal left out or something.

Besides, if you want to make it as a writer or artist you have to push people. She should know that. An artist or writer cannot let ignored emails stop them from trying to force people to look at their work; she's doing her students a disservice by teaching them that, in my opinion. She should be fostering your tenacity, because that is what you'll need.

This is a pretty common problem with stay at home anything (work, parenting, etc). All you can try to do is not be an asshole in how you address it, but that doesn't mean you have to shut up and keep the house clean.",Human
2ykevm,"Not an asshole. Unless you're making a mess during the day and not clearing up after yourself.

I'd suggest getting a neutral 3rd party as an arbitrator for this, though. ""You are being unfair"" is way harder to argue with if it's not you saying it.",Human
2ykevm,"&gt;She ... gets furious if I expect her to help clean on her days off, because that's ""her only time to relax."" However, I am expected to spend my weekends cleaning, shopping, and running errands, and I get angry comments if dishes are unwashed or carpets unvacuumed when she gets home.

If this is a fair characterization of your life, then you live with a selfish asshole.   

One way it may be unfair is if you're the one who's insisting on the minimum standards of clean.  If you demand that things be much tidier than she cares about, then I'd say it's fair for her to say you should put more work into cleaning.  If she's the one inventing the demands, AND expecting not to work, double asshole points for her.  

Another way you might be being unfair is you might be forgetting to tell us about the benefits of being the one who works at home.  Does she run errands on the way home that you don't because you're never out?  With all things being equal, it's rational for her to expect you to do a little more cleaning when you work at home and she doesn't, since you don't have a commute...but the idea that you ought to spend several hours cleaning while you're both at work, is absurd.  If she's really pushing an ""everything goes my way"" balance and you're not getting any considerations going your way...congratulations, you're not the asshole. ",Human
2ykevm,"I think that you need to make a list of what needs to be done and how often it needs to be done (like: windows - once a month, dishes - every day, laundry - once a week, carpets - once a week, etc) and then divide up the chores, letting her choose what she hates the least (I know she doesn't like any of it) and make sure the chores and more-or-less evenly rationed out, unless you actually don't mind housework and want to do extra. 

This way there isn't a fight. There are things that grown-ups have to do, whether they like it or not. Unfortunately that is life once your mum throws you out of the nest. If she knows from the get-go that every day she has to make the bed and do the dishes and every Saturday she has to do the laundry and that every day you have to cook dinner and clean the bathroom and every Saturday you're vacuuming the rug then it would (hopefully) just become a job that has to be done that's fair and no room for negotiation or bad feelings about how unfair it is.

It's a really common problem where people think that stay-at-home jobs are just a vacation you get paid for. You see this with men being resentful of their stay-at-home-mum wives all the time. They don't take into account the work done caring for children and keeping the house up; they just think their wife is sitting on the phone and watching Oprah all day while they're out 'actually' working.

There are two sides, first your girlfriend is being disrespectful for not paying attention to what you're saying. When this happens and especially when you're interrupted mid-story this is highly irritating. and the fucking texting while in a conversation...... So you are not the asshole.

But the other side is that probably the way you speak or tell stories is not engaging. Think about this: does this happen with other people or only with your girlfriend? If it happens with other people you're probably not a story teller and does not encourage following on what you're saying.",Human
2ymm96,"On one hand, she's being a bit of the asshole for drifting off not listening, but on the other hand, you might be being passive-aggressively the asshole as well, if you're sulking off with the ""never mind"". You're a bit justified, but it's a petty bit of justified.

It sounds like you've got a hangup from the past that happens to get tickled unfortunately well by annoying tendency she has. It's unfortunate, but it's ""shit happens"", and you have to deal with what shit does happen. It sounds like the two of you just need to have a constructive conversation (i.e., ask and express, don't complain and accuse) on how to solve the problem, and come to some sort of understanding compromise. Maybe you can meet somewhere around ""Try not to be offended if I rudely snap you back to reality, and I'll try not to be offended if I have to.""

From what I'm hearing, you're not to the point of divvying up ""Asshole"" stickers yet. You're still at the ""unresolved problem"" stage. Your asshole-or-not distinction depends more on how you *handle* that problem going forward. Continuing to stew and snipe is a poor solution (or none at all) and is definitely the Way of the Asshole. I'd avoid that.",Human
2ymm96,"I think you need to think about this in terms of what is useful and going to improve the situation, not who is right or wrong.

Obviously you and your gf have different ideas about what constitutes ""respect"" and what constitutes a conversation (or even a relationship). It sounds like she has a different idea of what listening is, too.

I think you need to decide what it is you're trying to achieve here. I think you want:

**Respect:** she doesn't express respect through listening, so her listening would not really be a sign of her respecting you. Are there other ways that you can feel respected by her or know that she respects you?

**Talking:** You clearly have a desire to talk to her, but what does talking mean to you? When you listen to her, is that only out of ""courtesy"" or do you really want to know what she says? It may also be helpful for you to achieve communication (which is what you want) if you try to make your points more quickly so that she has less time to wander off, and ask her opinion on what you're saying so she feels more engaged.

**To be listened to:** You want her attention, but it sounds to me like she lacks impulse control. And that is something she could work on. If part of the problem is interruptions, maybe you could get her to agree to ""hold that thought"" when something suddenly occurs to her, until *after* you have finished talking. But when you have finished, then it's okay for her to mention her thought. That might be a compromise.

I have a co-worker who is like this. We'll get into a conversation and then he'll start to read something on his PC while I'm talking and then he'll say, 'Oh, what? Sorry.' As if to say, 'Oh my god, have you *actually* been talking that whole time?' Other times he won't even hear me at all. I'll say something and then realize that he mentally stepped out of the conversation 20 seconds ago and has heard nothing I've said since then.

It's really demoralizing. I don't even date this person or speak to him outside work and just these short work conversations make me feel like less of a human being. Plus, it's infuriating. How hard is it to listen for one minute?

OP - you seem surprisingly tolerant of this and I don't know why. How do you think your GF would react if she started telling you a story and then halfway through you just shouted, 'Oh my god! We should totally go out for tacos tonight for dinner! Oh, you're still talking. Go on.'? Would she just laugh it off the way you seem to do when it happens to you?

I can really understand his girlfriend's point of view, and might be able to say why this may not work for her. I have the same problem. I have attention issues, and I've tried to work on them.

Here's the problem with saying to hold that thought. If she's like me, if she doesn't just quickly ask her question, she's got to focus on remembering the question. Now she's waiting for you to finish, but doesn't want to forget her question. For me, if I don't put all my effort into remembering what I want to ask, I'll forget, but putting energy into remembering what I want to ask means I can't pay attention to the story they're telling. It's a catch-22 where either way you wind up ""not listening"" to the person.",Human
2ymm96,"Interesting to hear it from your perspective.

Would it be better to ask her to just let it go if it's not important? I mean, it seems to me that if the question is going to go away just like that and never come back to you later, it's probably not worth interrupting someone for? Or is that not accurate?",Human
2ymm96,"Well it's not any more or less important than the story the person is usually telling. But usually the annoying part about waiting is the question only takes a second to answer, and a person that takes a long time to tell a story might still be talking in ten minutes. Based on what OP said, the question isn't like ""why are we alive?"". Op said she says stuff like:

&gt; ""OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.""

Based on the context, it sounds like they're walking while he's telling a story. By the time he finishes the story, they won't be near the store anymore. And look at his example of the one he got mad over:

&gt; GF: ""Honey don't we know those two people from somewhere?""

Let's say she waits for him to finish his story. Now she's probably also trying to figure out where she recognizes the people from, if at all, distracting her. He tells his story for even just 5 minutes, but they've left at that point, so if she asks, she can't even get an answer. She seems to be interrupting to say or ask time-sensitive information that only takes a second, then get back to the story.

I agree with what one of the other posters said. If he routinely has trouble with a lot of people not listening to him when he talks, he's probably not a very good story teller in the first place. If this is a recurring thing, it probably means that he's telling long-winded stories that aren't very interesting. It's rude to interrupt it, but OP should ",Human
2ymm96,"Well, yeah, as per my original post I think it's a two way street and he has to work on his own side of the interactions too.

Since I hold up my end, and take pains to make sure that I hear everything she says and ask *meaningful* (not oblivious) follow up questions, then I'm at liberty to not like, completely get pissed at her, but at least point out that she's doing it.

2yue3v,"Sorry, post was on mobile so the grammar is atrocious. Friend 1 grabbed GF's hand and hit me with it. It wasn't a very hard slap but I definitely felt it, it was more humiliating than anything to see that it was OK to them to lay a hand on me. Definitely not going to be trying to get back together with someone who had friends that think like that.",Human
2yue3v,"I'm going to have to say NO to the ""Am I an asshole"" question. I dont want to be the  ""putting women in their place"" guy but nobody, not just women, should be hitting someone for continuing a joke that was already offensive to begin.

2yue3v,"Physical violence is never the answer, so you're right in that sense.",Human
2yue3v,"I don't think it matters that her friend slapped you with your (ex)girlfriend's hand.  Your ex is obviously quite racist towards white people, and being that you *are* white, the relationship was doomed anyway.  You're better off without her.  It may not feel like it now, but eventually you'll be happy it ended before you wasted years of your life on someone who hates you because you happen to lack melanin.",Human
2yue3v,"No, you weren't the asshole. They physically harmed you, and then went on to say that you can't be offended because your race doesn't matter. Of course you're going to be upset.

Sorry, I have to tangent and unload a little. You guys being 16, I can understand how this sort of point of view gets ingrained in you. So while I understand what they are saying, it's not correct and the world isn't black and white. 

A friend I know lives in Hawaii and you best believe she deals with racism often (I'll drop [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Haole_Day) here). She has gone past crazed men preaching to ""exterminate"" the white people in Hawaii. This is ridiculous to say, but Hawaii is a part of *America*. This sort of racism *does* exist. Saying that you can't be offended because you are white is racism. Racism isn't for ""every other race excluding white people"". That just doesn't make sense and would be racist in itself. White *privilege* on the other hand is a different concept, but not what we are talking about.

I am an American living in Japan, and absolutely there are some racist people here. Most are just fine, just like in America, but there's always that one person that just needs to judge everything about you just because the color of your skin.

&gt;

&gt;__Kill Haole Day__ is an annual event that some believe has occurred in some of [Hawaiʻi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii)'s schools. On the last day of school before summer vacation, non-white students are said to harass and sometimes attack [white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people) students. 

&gt;In his 2009 book, lawyer and former Hawaiʻi governor [Ben Cayetano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cayetano) wrote that ""Kill Haole Day"" began as a news story headline about an incident between [haole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haole) and local (not just Hawaiian) students. After that, ""whenever there was a fight or an incident between haole and non-haole students, the news media,"" and newspaper editorial boards, ""repeatedly reprised 'Kill Haole Day' in their news stories.""  

&gt;In 1999, School Superintendent Paul LeMahieu said he is aware of ""kill haole day"" but is not aware of any recent incidents. Also, in 1999, it became an issue for [hate crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crimes) legislation.

2yuni7,"I think you are an asshole. Not for telling him that you don't want to be friends, but the way you told him. Being honest isn't calling someone names. There was no reason to sit there and call him a creep. You guys didn't mesh well, he makes you uncomfortable, that is fine to say but insulting someone when they never actually did anything to you is always going to make you an asshole. 

You have to remember that how you say something is sometimes more important than what you are saying. ",Human
2yuni7,Mmmh... From what I can tell your friend seems childish. I imagine that you've noticed that. So putting it lightly would've been nicer to him but in the other hand he made you feel uncomfortable multiple times and made other people feel bad by calling then Nazis (Which is not a cool thing to do.),Human
2yuni7,"You're not *the* asshole, I don't think, but you weren't not an asshole. Not that there was any avoiding it though, the situation kinda sucked and when you're in it, you wanna get out. ",Human

2yuni7,"You're not the asshole. You tried to be honest and still somewhat polite about ""breaking up"" with him but he wouldn't take no for an answer (which is pretty typical creep behavior). When he kept protesting you had to get firmer. ",Human
2yuni7,"I don't get what the hell is going on in this situation. 

I mean, are you talking about FRIENDS friends, or is that some kind of euphemism? Because in my life, I never had to ""break up"" with any friends. If we didn't get along really well, we just sort of stopped talking? 

I have to say, calling someone a ""creep"" sucks. ""Creep"" has become this loaded word without a strong definition. It's just sort of vaguely bad and implies all sorts of bad shit. I mean, ""creep"" could run the entire gamut from child molester to just kinda being tacky. It's sort of a cop-out, a lazy way to defer on figuring out what you really don't like about someone. ",Human
2yuni7,"Yeah, I'd have to agree.",Human
2yuni7,"You're not an asshole for being honest about him making you feel uncomfortable, but I think you could've been a bit more patient. I think if I was in your shoes, I would have talked to him about his ""creepy"" habits first before going into the friend-breakup stage. He might have just thought he was just being honest and didn't realize how it made others feel.",Human

2yzfxg,"Filming it and sending it to her is unnecessarily extending the circumstances in an aggressive way. OP seems to be a fairly emotionally reactive person- ""dating this girl for *six* months,"" ""she had cheated on me so she could get with her ex,"" etc. 

I don't think either of them are morally justified, but sending her a filmed video of her stuff in the trash is high-school levels of immature, especially for a six month relationship. Should've just avoided response and feigned ignorance. ",Human
2yzfxg,"&gt;am I the asshole or did the bitch deserve it?

Those two options are not mutually exclusive.",Human
2yzfxg,"Well, I can certainly understand being angry and feeling justified for destroying the painting, but it is an asshole move, especially because you filmed it...I think that saying you threw it out would probably be adequate. What determines whether you're an asshole is where you go from here. Cut it off, pull away as quickly as you can, stop talking about it and her. The more justification you look for, the more of it you'll find. 

If that didn't make sense, what I'm trying to say is that you did an asinine thing in response to what seems like an awful situation. The sooner you end the whole situation the sooner you can move on and not worry about how much of an asshole you were or weren't.  ",Human

2yzfxg,"You're an asshole. She actually didn't owe you an explanation, as you were no longer dating. With the exception of child support, or back-rent, people who break up don't owe each other anything.

That relationship is over. It has kicked the bucket. It is an ex-relationship. Stop talking to her.

You went to her with the intention of starting an argument, and then did a thing to hurt her, on purpose.


Her cheating (if that's true) was an asshole behaviour, too, but it doesn't warrant yours.

In future I advise you cut contact completely after you break up with someone (for a year or so, at least).",Human
2yzfxg,You acted like a child. ,Human
2yzfxg,"She definitely sucks, but he didn't just throw out the painting after the break-up, or as a result of finding out about being cheated on.  He stopped and tried to figure out a way to get the most mileage out of it as a means to hurt his ex.   That's an asshole move. ",Human
2yzfxg,"You're both assholes, and you're both immature.",Human
2yzfxg,"She gave you the painting as a present, from that point on it was yours and you could have done whatever the fuck you wanted with it. And plus she cheated on you AND personally attacked you, a person she used to talk to about these things and went through them together (I'm assuming). She's the asshole.",Human
2yzfxg,"Well, in those situation you have to just be better person than her. ",Human
2yzfxg,"You're both kind of assholes but if she did cheat, she's the bigger one. The painting was a gift, after all. If you want to trash it that's your call. Doing so and filming it just to spite her is definitely a knee jerk reaction but she kind of started it. ",Human
2yzfxg,"I think in the asshole arena, you both are at a wash--equal, equal, which essentially means you are both not the asshole, and the asshole at the same time.  (Personally, I'd say that tie goes to not being an asshole by default.)

That said, I think the filming of the destruction was petty and dickish.  I think I understand *why* you did it.  You were hurt and angry and you wanted to fling that right back at her.  I get that; but it solves nothing.  It doesn't heal your hurt; it only encourages her to boomerang more shit your way.  The best thing to do in these situations, no matter how unsatisfying in the immediate timeframe, is to completely disengage.  There's a *lot* of energy involved in hating someone and it doesn't sound as if your ex was especially worthy of any more of your energy.  Disengage.  Don't give her any more power over you.  Then you don't have to question your assholery and most likely, it will irritate the shit out of her.  

As an artist, I think the destruction of 2 months work would sting me.  However, I would **never** ask for a painting back that I gifted to someone (unless it was temporary, for a show or something, and the receiver would get it back afterwards).  I've given paintings to romantic partners before.  When the relationships ended, I disengaged and walked.  If they wanted to keep the painting, fine.  If not, whatever--I'll never know the difference.  I take photos of every piece I give away for that very reason.

2z3jmp,"No, you're not the asshole, but you saying only ""hipsters"" buy vinyl is pretty incorrect. Lots of people like the way vinyl sounds compared to digital. Not all of those people are hipsters. 

Replace the word vinyl with book, and you can see the problem. Just because someone prefers books over Kindle doesn't mean they're any particular kind of person. You're not an asshole, but you did stereotype. ",Human
2z3jmp,"I didn't mean it to sound like only hipsters bought them, just the majority of people. That may be incorrect as well, as I am woefully unaware of music storage mediums, and who uses them. I think the analogy with books is a bit of a stretch. Codexes provide many benefits over digital reading devices. I don't think records have anywhere near as many benefits. It is difficult for me to believe many people would use records for any kind of practical benefit. I can still see your point though. I am at least relatively ignorant of the real uses, and I spoke from that position of ignorance.",Human

There's nothing wrong with either, I just think it's weird to make fun of one and not the other.",Human

Often times, they ask questions that people my age wouldn't simply because it doesn't occur to them that the questions might be a little....touchy.

So I can understand how the guy would be a little upset, but he shouldn't have called your father an asshole.",Human
2z3jmp,"Well for one thing, vinyl sounds better than your traditional digital file. Unless it's a lossless file, which is usually not the case for most people. And considering music is about listening, I would say that's the most important practical reason. ",Human
2z3jmp,"Huh, I didn't know that it sounded better. The only records I've ever listened to were old ones my grandparents had. I suppose age, and dust would have had an affect on the sound quality. Thanks for explaining.",Human
2z3jmp,"Yea, one of the downsides of vinyl is that they deteriorate while a digital file will not. I'm not saying one is better than the other, either. Just that both have their merits.",Human
2z3jmp,"What you're listening to them on makes a big difference, too. I have a stack of vinyl records, both old and new, and they sound like garbage on any record player that costs less than $150 or $200. I have a decent sound system at home, which they sound great on, but a cheap ($200) portable player at work where they sound lousy, for example.

Under perfect conditions, with a high end sound system, you can't beat vinyl, but odds are good that you don't own that equipment, and the only people that do are huge vinyl lovers, audiophiles, musicians, or hipsters.",Human

Or, it has a custom ROM which looks like the stock device, but can't emulate all the Samsung apps.

2zlbmi,Are your only reasons the single cancellation and delayed rescheduling?,Human
2zlbmi,"Are you an asshole? No, probably not. Are you potentially harming your business (and if you're a contractor, you ARE your business)? Yes.

You say in your OP that the client is a small business owner that does much of the work himself. Sometimes that takes precedence over less important things such as phone interviews. You don't know what this emergency was. Maybe their store caught on fire. Maybe they had a death in the family. Maybe business is booming and he has to get personally involved.

Don't jump to conclusions and shoot yourself in the foot just because things aren't moving as quickly as you would like. Unless you have other clients pounding on your door and your time is too valuable to waste on this business, you owe it to yourself to give the client time to get back to you. Otherwise, you're essentially saying, ""My freetime is more valuable than my potential income.""

Are you sitting around twiddling your thumbs waiting for the phone to ring? Are you losing out on income while waiting for this guy to get back to you? If not, what's the harm in waiting?",Human
2zlbmi,Yeah kind of. Things like this happen in a small business setting often. It's probably why the employer is looking for help.,Human
2zlbmi,"No. The position I'm at is an indefinite contract. The position I'm going for is a nine month contract that would give me more experience, but nothing beyond that. The client is based out of state. My fear is that if he can't get things organized enough to make a firm commitment on a phone interview, he might not have the time to make training materials so that I know what I'm doing when I walk in the door.",Human
2zlbmi,"Free time? Who said anything about free time? I'm currently working at a job that I love. The only reason why I'd go to this other job is for the higher-level experience that it would provide. The issue here isn't about me being impatient. It's about mutual respect and honoring the other person's time.

I understand that things come up and that you have to deal with those things. At the same time, he is a business, just like I am. If I see that you can't make it to your initial meeting and then don't take the time to get back to me, it looks like you're done with the business relationship. It makes you look bad as a business because you can't keep with your commitments. At least have the decency to say, I'll get to you next week rather than have the recruiter come to me and say ""I haven't heard anything, we'll see what we can do.""",Human
2zlbmi,Then I would say you're totally in the clear.,Human
2zlbmi,"You aren't the asshole. But, don't burn a bridge. If they want to know why you are declining don't be overly critical in response.",Human
2zlbmi,"Not an asshole, just entitled.  You seem aware that you're not the asshole, but I doubt this sub will rally with you. If you decline, don't explain that it's because of 'mutual respect' and gloat that it's not even a job you need. They will hear negative louder than silence and they won't interpret it as something the company needs to improve like you're probably hoping. Don't hurt your business because of rules in your head.",Human
2zlbmi,"I'm not sure where you get that I'm ""entitled"". All I'm asking is that the same rules that apply to candidates be applied to clients. That is all.

I do agree that they don't need to hear a long list of negatives. That is why I consented to wait to hear what the client had to say at the end of the day. If they push if off further, or give a ""some time later"" kind of answer I won't need to say anything more. I'll just keep playing along for now.",Human
2zlbmi,"I agree. I didn't try to burn a bridge here. In fact, I made it clear to the recruiter that I loved them and how they kept me in the loop. I just wasn't happy with the lack of an answer from the client. My goal wasn't to burn this guy into the ground. It was to get out of the interview because I didn't feel safe with this client. The recruiter didn't want to hear that.",Human
2zlbmi,"That was the response of the recruiter, in a sense. He said that I should be able to understand these things because I work in the same industry as the client.

I explained that I understood, but I have commitments that I make to customers all the time. If I fail to follow through with those commitments and keep the customer waiting indefinitely for an answer, I'll eventually lose them. 

Like I've said before, something as simple as a ""I'll get to you next week"" would be acceptable. I didn't even get that. I got an ""I'll get to you when I get to you.""",Human
2zlbmi,"I get that it seems flakey.  I don't think you're an asshole, but I also think that any opportunity to interview is a good one.  If nothing else, you get to practice interviewing.  You have no obligation to take the job, after all.  And it might be something you love.  But if you have a gut feeling that this is not something you're interested, don't bother.",Human

Businesses usually don't have egos as big as yours. Your attitude is more of a jilted lover than someone waiting on an interview. ",Human
2zvgvl,"Yes. It's just some webcomics, man. I get that you want to share things with your brother, but I think by reminding him multiple times a day that you want him to do that is making him resent you and it ruining things that you could share. It's his time, let him spend it how he wants. ",Human
2zvgvl,"I feel that if he always says he'll get to it someday but usually takes a number of years for him to get to it, while meanwhile I get to things he wants to pretty quickly, he kinda deserves it. And in general, he doesn't really have a good grasp of prioritizing other people's needs above his own.

I guess you're probably right though. Deep down, I think I knew I was being an asshole. I think the question I really wanted an answer to was if he was being an asshole too.",Human
2zvgvl,"It is sort of rude to brush you off repeatedly, but if he doesn't want to do it or has other things he wants to do first, that doesn't make him an asshole. Maybe you could talk to him about working out a definite time line (""I'll read that after I finish ___"") or saying outright when he doesn't want to do something. ",Human
2zvgvl,"The thing is, he really does want to do it. Like, with over half of the things I suggest, he says he will get around to it. The problem is, he never does. Sadly, working out a timeline is something he always changes the subject from. I've usually never even been impatient about this kind of thing. Most of the time, I'm not asking for something immediately, I just want a bit of commitment. I've only been bugging him a lot lately because of how often I notice him wasting time.",Human
2zvgvl,"Maybe he doesn't think he's wasting his time? I think just because he's not spending how you want him to doesn't make him unproductive. Another thing you could try is finding something new for both of you to do, that might interest him? I dunno, man. I'd say try and lighten up a bit and keep it as a fun thing to do with your brother instead of something to pester him about. Just my opinion. Hope you guys get it figured out! ",Human
2zvgvl,OK. Thanks for responding!,Human
2zvgvl,"Not gonna lie my friend, I stopped reading halfway through.

But partially, that's because I have this very problem. I'm a bit of an over-sharer, if you will. I just, ah! I experience something and I want someone else to experience it too and *please* and *why won't you, it's so short!* Some of the people I know are super-adamant about resisting me, some are more sly with the 'yeah i'll get to it...' and some just appease me. I'm definitely not convincing them the right way, that's for sure.

Anyway it used to bother me a lot (now it just bothers me a little) because I realized that I do this too. Sometimes it's just hard to get someone to do something. And sometimes people explicitly DO NOT want to be told what to do.

The point is that nobody is an asshole here. But on a non-moral basis, I'll say: if you really want someone to experience something, just lead them into it. There's a classic phrase that says, ""the way to convince someone you're right is to convince them that it was their idea,"" or something to that effect. That holds up here, too. A little bit of fandangling can go a long way. Sometimes people don't want to follow recommendations because it deprives them of their agency, they want to feel like they made a discovery or a contribution instead of just following someone else's ideas. Try to find a way to expose them that allows them to feel a little validity.",Human
2zvgvl,"Yes. Back the hell off.

How he spends his free time is none of your business. You get to make suggestions. You don't get to dictate his behavior.

From your description, I'd say your brother is being a lot nicer about all this than I would be. Leave the man alone.",Human

And given the huge number of things that we've shown each other and loved, I don't think it's about him wanting to keep his agency. Thanks for responding.",Human
2zvgvl,There's nothing wrong with sharing stuff but man you're going overboard. He isn't trying to spite you by not doing the 11 things you listed for him to do. Just back off for a while and let him do his own thing.,Human

2zvgvl,"**TL;DR: Don't ruin a great friendship with your brother over a webcomic or two, and don't ruin fun things by turning them into chores!**


I know where you're coming from, but I must state here and now - your brother is not the asshole. You might not be quite the asshole yet, but very well could become the asshole if you keep this up! I speak from experience!

I think that if you continue pestering him about these things, you'll only create resentment which will make him even less likely to check out the things you want to introduce him to.  If you keep pressuring people, you turn something that would otherwise be enjoyable into a chore. You seem to enjoy talking to your brother about your shared interests, so it would be a shame if you pushed him away with this behaviour.

I say this as someone who has a sister who likes the exact same kinds of music I do (and even plays this style of music at her gigs) and yet she's just sometimes not in the mood to be introduced to something new in this genre, even if it's something I think she'd love. Years later, she'll discover organically the same artist or song I wanted to share with her. It used to make me upset the same way you are feeling right now, but I realised that was only leaving me feeling worse without changing anything. I still get a little resentful when she starts playing a song at a gig that I heard *years* before she ""found"" it, but I won't let it get my goat any longer. Nowadays, I just post stuff onto her facebook w",Human
2zvgvl,"I wouldn't worry about it worrying our friendship. We've had much, much bigger problems and are still very, very close.

Also, I think I overstated how much he's getting annoyed. There's a lot of subtlety and nuance to how much I'm reminding him and how he responds. Really, he only gets annoyed when he brings up that I keep asking him (while still not being annoyed) and I say something back and things escalate from there. I think I described it as him usually getting annoyed because a bit of an argument was what prompted this post. Most of the time, it turns into more of a conversation about how he does want to read them but just is busy at the moment. Which just happened a few minutes ago.",Human
2zvgvl,"Your brother sounds like a genuinely nice person who is interested in the things you want to share with him - he now sounds like even less of an asshole, and I didn't even think he was the asshole in the first place.

It's a fact of life! I live with seven other people just like that! :P I think you should keep in the back of your mind that he is his own person and while you can lead a horse to water, you can't make him drink. As a serial-sharer, I know how you feel more than you realise - just look through my post history. I like a certain make up product - and I believe I've shared my story about it with thousands of people at this point, in full essay form, at every given opportunity. I'm not bullshitting you here, I do get you!

I think there really is only so much you can do here. I wouldn't say stop sharing things with him or anything, but I would remind yourself that you can't truly make him do anything. I also would avoid judging how he spends his day - that'll get you into asshole territory right quick! 

Maybe pick one thing at a time to share with him as opposed to many different things. I'm not sure there's much else you could do or SHOULD do. This is just human nature we're dealing with here.

OP is in no way an asshole. If he was just raging and flipping him off that's one thing but it sounds like the cabbie almost caused an accident a few times.",Human
3056p1,"Define ""almost cause an accident"".  

Let's conservatively estimate the cabby spends 15 hours a week driving in rush hour conditions.  Let's also conservatively estimate those two close calls were the only 2 in that hour.  If we generalize that out, there are 30 near accidents per week.  So if ""almost causing an accident"" means a 3.3% chance of an accident, he'd average one accident per week.  How long do you think a cab driver would stay employed if he got into one accident per week?  Hell, he'd probably have big problems if he got into an accident once per quarter, which would mean ""almost causing an accident"" means causing a situation where there's a 0.25% chance of an accident.

What's far more likely is he startled OP.  It's quite possible he was driving like a dick, but we've got no idea what kind of a driver OP is.  Nobody thinks that they're a shit driver, but the vast majority are dozy at best.  And considering the likelihood of significant exaggeration in OP's perceptions, doesn't seem reasonable to assume OP's in the minority who are situationally aware while driving.  Did OP weigh the possibility that OP was also driving like a dick?  And even if OP was driving fine, do you think this dude deserves to lose his already shitty means of feeding his family over causing a 0.25% chance of probably just inconveniencing OP?  

Also, how much weight did you give to that hypothetical about the innocent bystander?  Hopefully not much, especially the whole bit about wrecking ",Human
3056p1,"Did you even read the story? He cut OP off and was a few inches away from his car. If the cabbie had to step on the breaks. Boom. Accident since no individual has that fast enough of a reaction time, even going 10 mph.

Also the hypothetical is pretty likely if you smash someone's wheel and fuck it up. Then you have to get it to the shop and wait for the repair which could take a few days depending if they have the parts and how busy they are and if the company that individual works for is shitty the chance of being fired because you can't get a ride to work is pretty high. 


Im not talking about a year duration. Im talking about this specific incident. The cabbie almost caused an accident due to aggressive driving (which means it was intentional) and shouldn't have a job as a driver.",Human

That OP's reaction time is so quick that s/he was able to slam on the brakes with another car within a few inches, or OP's memory of the event is skewed?

Seems you're not bringing any level of critical thought to this.  If you take the story at face value it doesn't make any sense - 10 mph = 176 inches per second, go take a ruler and see how close 1 foot is from your car and ask yourself how likely it is that OP's estimate, early in the morning, immediately after being admittedly frightened, is accurate.

The first is the cabbie's driving was indicative of his general driving habits, in which case the only conclusion is it wasn't anywhere close to as dangerous as OP suggested or else law of averages suggests the cabby would be getting in a fuck ton of accidents, far too many to remain employed regardless of whether or not OP reported him.

At least it's an example of how most aren't aware of their lack of situational awareness.

Your summary of my argument isn't accurate.  A more accurate summary would be ""If the cabby really drove as dangerously as OP suggested he would more than likely get into a ton of car accidents, when you consider how much time cabbies spend driving in rush hour traffic.  When you combine this incongruity with how unreliable the human memory is and the probability that OP's situational awareness isn't particularly remarkable, chances are very good he wasn't driving nearly as dangerously as OP suggested.""  

What you're calling assumptions are actually deductions.  The key difference is the bit where I explain the reasoning that led to my conclusions (i.e. the stuff you apparently didn't read).  If you disagree with the logic, by all means say what specifically you disagree with, but simply dismissing them all in the abstract is a bit much coming from someone who apparently takes great issue with trolling.",Human
3056p1,"&gt; If the cabby really drove as dangerously as OP suggested he would more than likely get into a ton of car accidents

There's nothing that says this is true. You misunderstand how odds work. And how people work. And how everything works. It's this shitty leap of logic that says you're just arguing for the sake of it. Also no one was saying the cabbie drives like this constantly, just enough for OP to have seen it, which is enough to report. This also rules out the option of the cabbie being a new cabbie.

&gt;When you combine this incongruity with how unreliable the human memory is

Then nothing *anyone* says in this sub has *any* merit if it can just be dismissed with ""well yeah but you're probably just remembering it wrong"". Seriously, this is a nonpoint.

&gt;and the probability that OP's situational awareness isn't particularly remarkable,

How in the hell do you know? Maybe OP has amazing awareness. You're assuming for no other reason than it supports your argument.

&gt;chances are very good he wasn't driving nearly as dangerously as OP suggested.

Another point that isn't really a point. OP never said ""Did he almost kill everyone?"" They just wanted clarification if they overstepped in the follow up to the incident.

Honestly, I am going to go with no. Why? Because you are single. Sure it isn't morally right, but those morals are up to you to decide. You wanted some, you did what you could to get some, I do not see how you are at fault. It is not your job to make sure she is faithful, and if she doesn't care about being faithful...well then I do not see why you should be obligated to protect her relationship.

30hobf,"&gt; Please point out one assumption my post suggests anyone make.

In a situation like this with no details, then you're going to have to make assumptions in order to respond. The most likely assumption, as you admit, is that the couple in question practices a monogamous sexual relationship. The first assumption that you suggested is that the relationship is nonexclusive. That's not entirely unlikely but if that's the nature of the relationship, why, then would OP be concerned about being an asshole? Your second suggested assumption is that the male in the relationship is impotent and wants his lover to be sexually fulfilled. I would not bet good money on that. That's nothing more than a shot in the dark. 

Essentially, when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.

&gt;  I question why it's immoral for ANYONE to have sex with ANYONE who appears to be linked, when that person obviously does not want that limitation. If she's wrong to offer it, that's her failure, not his.

I don't know why it's not right but it doesn't feel right. I'm sure someone else can phrase it up better than I can.  I think that you know that it's immoral as well because of certain rules you've forged in other responses on this thread. 

&gt; If they're engaged, you suck.

How's that different from being in a monogamous ""vanilla"" sexual relationship? 

&gt; If you know the guy and he thinks of you as a friend, you're a giant scumbag.

***HOWEVER***

Personal responsibility being what it is, no. You are *not* the asshole.

You made no commitment to her boyfriend. ***She did.*** She broke her commitment. You fucked a girl. Does the label ""cheater"" apply to you? No, just her.

There can be more than one asshole.  If she's an asshole, how can someone encouraging and participating in her asshole behavior somehow be morally upright?",Human
30hobf,"It's not exactly 'morally upright', and it's not particularly kind, but it's not *wrong* and it doesn't make you an asshole. 

An exclusive relationship is a personal promise between two parties and breaking the promise is what makes you the asshole. If you're not party to the promise then you aren't obligated to uphold it, and being aware that someone else is breaking their promise is not your responsibility. 

And if someone has decided they want to cheat the promise is already broken, so what does it matter with whom they decide to cheat?",Human
30hobf,"The definition of an asshole to me is someone who puts their own selfish needs ahead of others and doesn't care about others' feelings as long as they get what they want.

If you have sex with someone and you KNOW it is going to hurt another person, and you do it anyway, that makes you an asshole.  If it's not kind, it's unkind, which is asshole behavior.  It's not morally upright but it's not wrong either?

Suppose I sell fish, and someone comes into my store wants to buy a bunch, but makes it clear they are going to be hiding them all over the house of someone they don't like.  Me, I'd refuse to sell to them, but apparently I could not only sell them the fish, but drive them over there, help carry them to the door, give them advice on the best places to hide them for maximum stench, etc, and as long as I didn't actually go into the house (cause that'd be a crime) I'm not an asshole.  I'm encouraging, participating, and helping an asshole do an asshole thing, but hey, I never made any agreement NOT to help someone hid fish all up in this guy's place, so while it isn't morally upright, it's not wrong either, just neutral apparently...

Obviously, when the homeowner shows up and finds a guy in his house and me out in the fish truck handing him more fish, if he is upset with me for helping, and calls me an asshole, well obviously that guy will just be WRONG to think I'm an asshole.  He'll totally be misplacing the blame if he thinks I in any way have wronged him.",Human
30hobf,"In your example, yes, that would make you an asshole, but I disagree that the situations are analogous. For one thing, there's no broken agreement, and for another what you're helping with is an actual crime and as means that you are also party to said crime (and broke your implied promise to society not to break the law).

Imagine instead that you were looking for a roommate and someone approached you, saying that they had already promised to be someone else's roommate, but that your place was better and they'd rather live with you? And if it's a marriage you're getting in the middle of, simply change the metaphor so that the other two had already moved in together and had signed the lease. 


Are you the asshole in that situation if you accept? I don't think you are, I think your new roommate is the one who broke their promise and who they choose to move in with afterwards is irrelevant.

But, circumstances changed and, for whatever reason, he felt like he had to spend the evening with his parents.  That sucks for both of you, I'm sure he was looking forward to it too.  But, if you're good friends with the guy, your obligation to him is to respect his decision and trust that he didn't make it lightly.  

Things don't always work out the way we hope.  When they don't, you gotta accept it and show some grace, not get mad and sulk because you didn't get your way.  In my experience, when you find yourself in a position where you are demanding an apology from a friend, you should step back and try to see the situation from their position.  It kinda sounds to me like you owe him a little bit of an apology.",Human

55nipi,"Here's why you're an asshole:

You assume your experience with depression was the same or comparable to anyone else's.  By assuming that what you called depressed was the same as what the other person was experiencing, you assumed that your ability to overcome it was transferable to them.  I made the same mistake recently, and I know I was the asshole and now I know why.

I too was depressed, and I too (like you) realized that (for me at least) it was possible to smile for the sake of it, fake it til you make it, and eventually you realize that your demeanor, mindset, etc. is a choice.  I imparted this outlook on my sister-in-law who is the biggest sweetheart ever but her experience is not the same as mine, so telling her that depression is a product of a society with too much time on its hands and that there's no depression in a 3rd world village because everyone has a job to do and no time to sit around and be bored or melancholy... anyway, she called bullshit, was really upset and then I realized it doesn't matter how I see it, or what I was able to do, you can't just tell someone to get over it even if that's exactly what they need to do.

I agree with your point of view and honestly believe that you were trying to help... but sadly, you're still the asshole.

Not much I can do now unfortunately, what with him blocking me and all. :/",Human
55nipi,"Yeah, you're an asshole, and here's why:

You're taking a lot of assumptions about yourself and this other person that, because they might be depressed, you have the same experience. Depression is very unique to each who suffers from it. You also assumed that because you made it out, that gives you some moral high ground to give advice to other people.

The truth is that people don't like unsolicited advice. It makes people feel like you're better than them, or you're looking down on them. It's understandable and commendable that you were trying to help (and, let's be honest, this could just be some dumb teen trying to be edgy,) but you just went the wrong way about it. So, wear your asshole badge with pride. ",Human
55nipi,"I don't see a reason to point you as the asshole, you sympathised and said his view was pessimistic.

Edit: Okay I misread, how I understand peoples' responses. I still don't think you're an asshole though, really. I mean, it's not like you're reflective of your actions here. Sure, you might have jumped the gun a little bit in terms of what yu said, and blocking him, but it sounds more mistaken than asshole'ish.",Human

55qeyu,"Not an asshole for being upset, but you may want to communicate with him about how you feel (i.e. your effort being minimized). He's likely just being hyperbolic and realizes you do other things. It's not unreasonable for him to expect you to do housework.",Human

55qeyu,"I'd say it depends on your consistency and attitude toward it. 

The problem with my step kids is that they've never had to do anything for themselves until they met me. As such, they don't follow or take directions well and things we go over in detail don't get done properly. This gets frustrating having to repeat myself all the time and re-clean things etc...

People online are still real people, you're just interacting with them through a different medium. There is nothing less real about talking with a person face-to-face versus phone versus text.

They talked and had each other on all social media and it ended up not being the person they thought it was.

And yes, it is definitely less real talking to someone via text than face to face. I'm not saying it doesn't count as talking to someone, but they are 2 very different things.",Human

The online friend is a crazy cunt. She was manipulative, and trying to guilt you into a relationship you don't want to be in. 

BUT

Here's where you become the asshole:

&gt; Many many months later after not talking to each other at all (and no longer friends on any social media), I texted her. She was on my mind and I wanted to see how she was doing.

She may have just gotten over you. In your mind it may have been no big deal, but in her mind, it was essentially a bad breakup from a serious relationship, and you texting her back would have sent everything back right at her face. Texting someone back months after you dump them is a very asshole thing to do. 

So she's crazy, and you're an asshole. ",Human
55snbp,She needs some help with her mental health and it would be in your best interests to avoid her until she gets that help.,Human
55snbp,"That makes sense. I see what you mean. To me, I saw it as simply trying to reconnect with any old friend (something I've done a couple times since high school). I guess I should've realized that if she wanted to talk to me, she would've.

It saddens me, but it is what it is.",Human
55snbp,"So about this...

I have another online friend that I've known for about two years. We talk a few times a week, typically over Skype. He's become one of my closest friends.

Well this past weekend I finally got to hang out with him in person. And it was just like we were talking on skype. He was exactly the same and we had a great time.

Yes, SOME people can lie about who they are. But when you have stead, voice-to-voice or webcam-to-webcam communication, it's not too terribly different from being in person. The only thing you're really missing out on is how they go about their daily routines. And unless their schedule says everyone 5am quietly murder a cat, you're fine and they're fine.",Human
55snbp,"I was thinking exactly the same. Just when it looks like Crazy got over it, there goes Op to remind her of her feelings.",Human
55snbp,As I read this I was thinking the same thing. OP got what they wanted. The friend finally moved on. Making contact with them again given the emotional trauma the friend had obviously gone through was selfish.,Human
55snbp,"Not the asshole. You aren't responsible for her feelings. Carving your initials into her flesh is textbook manipilation. I would never speak to her again if I were in your position, its only going to get much much worse.

Stupid shit like threatening to self-harm or even suicide if you don't reciprocate feelings with her is gonna happen eventually. Seen this way too many times. Might go through with the self-harming but suicide is almost always a bluff.

Don't think you're the asshole for trying to connect with her again. Again, her feelings are not your responsibility. You did nothing wrong.",Human
55x7y8,Nope you arent the asshole and it is an extremely common tactic to put your best picture ever as your main just to get matches. ,Human
55x7y8,"Not an asshole...but definitely not the best move to start asking about weight, putting on your detective cap, and trying to figure out if the fat was the before or after shot.  People are very sensitive about their appearance.  If SHE brings it up, then it can be discussed, if not, it stays unmentioned forever. ",Human
55x7y8,Is there a better way to handle it? I think it's very rude to be deceptive like that. It's hard to be excited for a date of you don't even know if they're attractive.,Human
55x7y8,"First of all - kind of an asshole. Sounds like he didn't slip that in subtle, just went at it. There are ways to get your answers without explicitly saying it.

In response to putting the best picture first, I tend to do better when my first photo is me on my bike, in my helmet. Not as well when it's my face. And it's not like my face is bad, so it leaves me a little confus ed",Human
55x7y8,"She is being decieving about what she looks like currently, he asked her if she was doing that and she responded weirdly so she most likely was being deceptive. Theres no way hes an asshole for having standards of who he wants to date. ",Human
55x7y8,"Here's how you handle it: put ""no fatties"" in your bio.

Problem solved.",Human
55x7y8,"I don't think she was being deceptive.  It's human nature for someone to set their main picture as a really good picture that puts them in the best light.  If she wanted to be deceptive, she would have had no fat pictures available at all.  

I'd say if weight is a make or break deal for you, you should probably list that on your profile.   Pre-empt the whole situation.  That would be my recommendation for a better way to handle it.",Human
55x7y8,"I say kind of an asshole, because I doubt he worded it well. There's a big difference between just saying ""hey, I've been tricked before, are you fat?"" And something that implies the same question, but without coming right out bluntly saying it.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with having standards, and everyone should have their set of criteria. Please don't think I'm advocating lowering standards or ""give her a chance, maybe her personality makes up for it."" Attraction is the base of any romantic relationship, personality is the base of a friendship. ",Human
55x7y8,"Shoulda just gone on a date. Worst case scenario, you never talk again. You may have blown a good thing. In reality you just did her a favor by showing her that you value vanity over personality. ",Human
55x7y8,"I personally think you should have gone out with her and seen for yourself, but totally call her on it if she's being deceptive with her pics.  Why not give her the benefit of the doubt then if she's being dishonest call her on it and make sure that she appreciates the if YOU were dishonest in your pictures that she wouldn't stand for it either (as no one with any self respect would).  NTA.",Human
55x7y8,"I will jump in and say it's fine. Let's look at the scenarios 1) she is bigger and posted a smaller pic of herself to get more swipes. In this scenario she knew what she was doing was to deceive people and get that chance. 2) it's a bad pic. Why use it? Cause she wants to weed out people that might care if she isn't what she seems. Good, dodged a bullet with someone trying to be over analytical. 3) the larger pic is the old one. You ever met someone that was larger and lost weight through hard work and WASNT proud of it? Me neither. I realize there is the 4th all other scenarios (what if she got cancer and lost weight and didn't want to talk about it.......) that are so rare it's statistically ok to ignore them. Honestly, asking clarifying questions is just fine if you are confused. If your profile pic was you with a Ferrari and your profile talked about your small rental with 3 roommates and someone asked why those didn't seem to add up you wouldn't get upset, you'd explain. Unless you were being shady.",Human
55x7y8,So attraction should form no part of a relationship? ,Human
55x7y8,Definitely not what I'm saying. I'm suggesting that you don't obsess over vanity before you get a chance to even meet someone.,Human
55x7y8,So you're allowed a bit of vanity?  How much exactly? ,Human
55x7y8,OP was presumably attracted to her on some level because he swiped in the first place. Therefore it seems sensible to give the benefit of the doubt. ,Human
55x7y8,Your username is very helpful,Human
55x7y8,"If you want to have a real conversation, let's have one. Don't be a troll. You and I both know it's not something you quantify. All I'm saying is give someone a chance before saying they're not attractive enough. Even if you meet someone and you get along but you're not physically attracted to them you could still become good friends. I've made some of my best friends that way. It's a two way street and attraction has to be there on multiple levels; intellectual, personal, spiritual, physical, etc. but not even having a damn cup of coffee with someone because they MIGHT be ""fat"" is a character flaw and the symptom of a weak person with major insecurities. The fact that people look past physical attraction is the only reason 99% of people (including you) get laid (assuming you're not a virgin living in your mom's basement). ",Human
55x7y8,Wouldn't like to say whether in this circumstance you were an asshole or not without further information. But you are an asshole,Human
55x7y8,"You're an asshole, but own it. It's a dirty trick, and it kinda pisses me off, but you're both assholes. It's false advertising on her part, and you called her out on it. I think you're an asshole just because you lack tact. That's all. 

You like what you like, and if she's projecting herself in one light and then turns out that's not what she really looks like, it's basically low tier catfishing. 

Just move on, handle the next one better. 

And if she asks about your height, all bets are off.",Human
55x7y8,"Of course, ""Which of your pictures is the most recent one? Mine is&lt;picture No.x &gt;"" Boom, you have your info, she gets to keep her dignity.",Human
55x7y8,OP was attracted to what she used to look like. ,Human
55x7y8,"I actually go out of my way to avoid becoming friends with people who's initial intention was for something romantic. In my experience I've come across men who I'm just not interested in after giving it a try and they say ""nah I don't have feelings we can be friends"" and they end up just hiding the feelings from you and having a break down later on. Not really my ideal way of making friends. I'm on a dating app to find a date and why waste my time on a date with someone I'm not attracted to? Sure call me vain but I'm not saying attraction is everything, I'm just saying it matters. ",Human
55x7y8,"Definitely an asshole. There's an expectation that people put their best foot forward on dating sites and social media. You knew after seeing some of the other pictures that she was probably heavier than her original picture. You could have unmatched then or tried anyway. Instead, you grilled her about her weight--a very sensitive topic for most women. It's fine if you don't want to date someone that's overweight, but you don't have to make them feel bad about it.",Human
55x7y8,Not the asshole. There was a video on YouTube about people doing this exact thing. They did had tuner profiles with skinny people and then when the dates happened they were fat and they did it with both genders and people got upset on both sides. If she's saying that shit about the glasses changing the way she looks she probably is fat.,Human
55x7y8,Somewhat asshole but very fair game.  Many women give height limits on tinder.  The only difference between your weight standards and their height standards is that they can control their weight ,Human
55x7y8,"If you think she's fat, then she's fat.",Human
55x7y8,"yes you're an asshole. Don't mention someone's weight, ever. Just because you're at what someone else deems 'a healthy weight' does not give you a moral superiority over anyone. 

Do a little detective work for yourself. If you find someone unattractive, just let it go, don't throw it in their face. ",Human
55x7y8,"I actually disagree. If weight/body size is an important factor to you when looking for a partner, then isn't it better to be up front about it? Why hide it?",Human

55x7y8,see my other comment where I go more into detail about this.  I recommend he put it in his profile that it's a big deal to him.,Human

55x7y8,"Look, that's your right to do so. You are doing them a favor in that instance. This however, does not make you a better person.",Human
55x7y8,"I clearly said that attraction is important. You make valid points and you are right to say it's not everything. My main point here is to make people (mostly men) aware that fat shaming is the act of an under evolved person and that their expectations to have all women ""worthy"" of their affection must be nearly ""perfect"" by their unrealistic standards while they themselves are nowhere near meeting their own physical vanity standards. It's like trump saying a woman is fat and or ugly. It just makes zero fucking sense.",Human
55x7y8,Upvote for you!,Human
55x7y8,I never said I thought I was a better person because of that and I don't think anyone here is stating that. But it doesn't make me a bad person either. I also don't say to people no I will not date you because you're fat. I say thanks I'm flattered but I'm not interested. ,Human

That is a truly strange thing to say. Most people aren't routinely accused of being abusers or emotional manipulators. The fact that this seems to be true of OP's friend, coupled with the fact that they're steadfastly refusing to drop this minor disagreement, troubles me.

$SF-Skype Friend

$RM-Roommate

OP is 100% huge asshole here as far as I can tell. $SF was reading a fan fiction. The fan fiction could have literally been about how Super Saiyan Hitler raped the Power Puff Girls and it would have been fine. It is not cool to shame someone over things they like (unless it is straight up illegal). From what I could tell it looks like $SF dropped it pretty early on when you showed you were not interested in it but you went ahead and got information to show him how ""wrong"" it is anyway.

When $RM came into the situation you didn't have to say anything but you went ahead and told them you had thoughts that $SF was doing creepy shit and you didn't like it. This was not the cause it was just some escalation to the situation. $SF became upset when you told him why $RM was talking to him out of the blue and was very defensive. The reason i think he sounds upset is that you inadvertently(or deliberately) said ""I think that $SF is a pedo.""

If I were to guess its because you left out lots of the conversation where you were hounding him and trying to show him the thing he likes is wrong for one reason or another.

You say he kept pulling up quotes and you had to defend yourself. What kind of quotes are these, what did you say that he decided it was a good idea to quote stuff. You say that you were trying not to judge but that is exactly what you are doing, $SF didn't like being judged by you.

I could go on but I will stop this here. Apologize t",Human

Also some irrelevant stuff about said roommate since the two of them don't get along.",Human

I absolutely think you're right to be worried, since, well, a lot of media and culture prime us to think youth is a part of sexiness (especially for women; Barely Legal, Sexy Teens, and shaving genitals are all societally accepted as more attractive than a woman in their 30s with a bush). Sounds like this fan-fic is just another piece of hay on the haystack.

Anyway, it just sounds like your friend is super fragile about this, but they don't seem like an asshole, and neither are you. I recommend being sensitive about this topic from now on, but not backing down on your stance. Explain yourself more gently, and if they can't take the idea that fantasizing about a relationship where one character is a child is pedophilic, that's their problem. Not yours.

563054,"I agree that it was a stupid argument to have and that OP should have just changed the subject. In fairness to OP, though, liquor laws are inextricable from local culture. Different regions of the U.S. have distinct cultural relationships to alcohol, which lead to vastly different types of rules about alcohol sale and consumption (e.g. blue laws, which have stayed on the books in more religious areas).

Sometimes, liquor laws can themselves give rise to unique cultural conventions—for example, the 1.5-ounce pour law in Utah, which restricts the amount of the same type of liquor that can go in a particular cocktail and leads to some pretty interesting drink recipes. To pick another Utah law, bars there commonly have what's become known as a ""zion curtain,"" a partition between bar and patrons, which is a cultural oddity exclusive to the state. You can travel from state to state and see how certain laws (e.g. open container laws, difficulty of getting a liquor license) have changed the local drinking culture. It's also hard to argue that more far-ranging laws, such as Prohibition and the national minimum drinking age, haven't had enormous cultural impacts.",Human

The Singapore example sort of is cultural, and it's a law because their culture shapes the law that way.  Different cities, counties, and states within America having different liquor laws are not specifically culturally driven, but are most likely political.  The law is not necessarily representative of the culture of the region, but rather a reflection of the ideals of the policy makers of the area.  In a perfect world, the policy makers in an area would represent the people of that area, but we know that's not always the case.

If it were a cultural difference, the decision to sell different types of alcohol in separate stores would be inherent, and the laws would merely be a reflection of that. If the laws where you are from were changed to allow stores to sell multiple types of alcohol, I guarantee that they would start doing so. Therefore, the fact that different types of alcohol are sold in separate stores is a legal difference, not a cultural one.",Human
563054,"Maybe the law itself is not cultural, but it creates a different culture because of the effects of the law.

In this case, it is against the law to sell alcohol in the main building of a supermarket in some states, but not in others.  While the law itself may not be cultural, it creates the mentality in people who live in states with separate liquor stores that alcohol is not to be sold alongside everything else.

Let's say you go to a place where selling fireworks is illegal.  Nobody in that place is going to understand how they work, what they sound like, how far away from them you should stand, and all that jazz.  Now that person goes to a place where fireworks are not only legal, but very popular.  The people in this new place are going to be SHOCKED that the person from the other place doesn't know anything at all about fireworks, and the person who's not used to them potentially is going to be confused by what all the fuss is about, or may even be afraid of fireworks.

In this case there are two different cultures that arose due to the differences in laws.  In one place fireworks are illegal, so the people don't care/are afraid of/REALLY want to see fireworks.  In the other place, fireworks are just a normal part of life.  The law itself may not have been culture, but it still caused a cultural difference between these two places.",Human

I'm not sure what kind of place you work in, but where I work, when a position opens up, 500+ people apply. More often than not, someone who works there already will ""put in a good word"" to my boss and make his life easier.

You're also mad because they hired someone new instead of giving you more hours. I see that a lot too with my employees (I am not in charge of scheduling /hiring, just low-level management). When someone quits or gets fired, they get all excited that they're going to get more hours, but then my boss hires 2 more people. So let me ask you this. 

Are you a recent hire/are most people there recent hires? When someone quits at my workplace, it sends a bit of a panic to management that everyone else is dissatisfied and going to start quitting. So we hire 2 people to replace that 1, in case any of the other fairly recent hires decent to quit as well.

OP's brother wasn't complaining about doing the dishes (he did them right away), he's responfing defendivrly to criticism. Criticism that immediately followed his willing completion of the chore.

56u5f2,"Hmm, not really, I call people dude, man etc as gender neutral. But I can totally see that it looks to you as though I did, so sorry about that (and sorry OP).

56u5f2,"I don't think ghosting is the way to go. At least make it explicit that since she's essentially doing nothing, you'll consider your relationship over, and that's that. Explicit is always best in my experience. Especially in high school, but overall it's a good habit to have.",Human
56u5f2,It's just easier that way,Human
56u5f2,This happened to me in my early 30's. she's not into the relationship. Suck it up as a loss and move on. You're better than her.,Human

*Or* it's possible that your gf isn't interested in continuing things with you.

You don't know which of the two it is, so instead of jumping to conclusions, ask your gf what's going on. 

(P.S. Even if she does want to break up, you will be a bit of an asshole if you get angry over it-every bf/gf has the right to decide to break up).",Human

56xpbv,"I don't think you're an asshole if you brought it up calmly to him. I get annoyed and put my phone on do not disturb, if a group chat is going on, especially so if I can't currently participate in the chat.

56xpbv,Yeah I would just ask that at night you both put your phone on do not disturb so it doesn't buzz so much. Or get an alarm that isn't your phones and keep phones outside of the bedroom. (I've found that this helps me sleep a lot better in general),Human

56xpbv,"I started by making a joke of it, then I told him I found it annoying and asked how much it might continue, then I asked him to turn it off, which lead to him saying that I shouldn't stop his social life.  My feeling is that home is somewhere you don't have to be sociable.  

I wouldn't want to spoil his enjoyment, but I don't want to be disturbed by it.  Maybe it is a generational thing, some people find it rude to check phones while you are in company, others think it is ruder not to check messages when you get them... gerroff mah lawn!

I told him the other week something I thought was quite romantic.  I'm naturally a bit of a misanthrope and told him that he was the person who pisses me off the least, that he was my favourite person ever.  He didn't see it the same way as I did, I thought I was being quite romantic.",Human

Seems like it could genuinely be a two-way communication mishap, no? He insists on calling because he can't write text, and you insist on texting because you can't hear. Yes you offered he could write in Spanish, but maybe the repairman doesn't know how to write properly at all? It could be that he doesn't want to admit that, or that he's trying to say that to you but you interpreted it as ""he doesn't know how to write English"" instead of ""he doesn't know how to write"". Once you start making certain assumptions communication can go wrong very fast, and if you don't understand someone 100% you start making assumptions to fill in the gaps. If this goes in both directions, there doesn't have to be an asshole at all, just a communication problem.",Human

573rfr,"She sounds like a bitch and is so not worth your time or energy. If it's possible for you, you should just avoid her and stop interacting with her. She sounds like the kind of person you would have to walk on eggshells for, and that's not fair to you.",Human
573rfr,"The thing is, being an inherently quiet person, most of the others' perception of me is tainted by negative interaction between my roommate and myself. I don't know what to do about that, either. And the fact that she's the one doing the complaining means I'm automatically the bad guy.",Human
573rfr,"I put one in. It is a days-long interaction, but I did get a little carried away with the details because the details are what I tend to focus on when trying to figure out what I did wrong.",Human
573rfr,"What did she tell your friends? Because Something along the lines of ""he told you I was on the phone to my BF when you asked me where I was"" shouldn't invoke a tainted perception g",Human
573rfr,"Thanks, totally not the asshole in this situation, but she is with the facts given.

",Human
573rfr,"Idk what she says about me because it's not me she says it to.

What she finally did blow up about (later incident, trying to figure out the long-standing bad attitude's source) was that I apparently ""talk about people"" and ""never open up"".

If she's saying to others that I ""talk about people"", where her definition of that is ""says truthful things that are of positive-to-neutral value in casual observation/conversation"" and others' definition is more likely to be ""constantly talks shit"", it can't reflect well.

Of course, that's speculation and I should hope she'd stick to truthfulness and offer real examples like the one original post is about, but that doesn't seem to be the case. But, if I go around trying to see what she's been saying, I'll look like a nosy bitch, so I just get to twiddle my thumbs and let things go.

Edit: The ""never open up"" bit is pretty true, but I'm not sure how to approach someone being mad about that. Certainly it doesn't foster any confidence in them as a viable person to ""open up"" to, whatever that means.",Human
573rfr,"Well think about it this way, If she actually does tell people you talk about people, is she not being the gossipy one? and if it's true that you don't say anything negative behind peoples backs to anyone else, then the people she is telling it to should already know you don't because you don't talk about people negatively to them. So if she is talking shit she is just making herself look more like a bitch.",Human
573rfr,"You are not an asshole, she is.

She seems to be a perpetually toxic, angry person who can't communicate with people or deal with people being different.  If she's that pissed off about something that simple, after you tried to accommodate her and adjust your behavior around her, she has deeper issues that she needs to address.

I noted that you alluded to already stepping on eggshells around her, trying to take her side on things like dinner choices, etc. Her attitude problem is starting to affect how you act, which is a bad thing.  People like her want to control others through their anger and tantrums.  Who knows, she may have been in an abusive household growing up, and that's how they delt with things. 

You have to live your life for YOU, taking a reasonable amount of respect for others, finding a balance between yourself and others. I would distance myself from Ms. Anger and not try so hard to please her.",Human
573rfr,"Are you the asshole? I don't know.  Honestly, I don't give a shit. 

When you have a relationship--almost any kind of relationship--you have to keep an open line of communication open.  You two don't.  I don't know who's fault that is, I don't care.  When someone gets told a friend is mad at them and shows no immediate interest in why (you did) or someone says they're angry and won't give you specific and comprehensive reasons why (she did), then there is a total communication breakdown.  It doesn't strike me that either of you are particularly blameless, and it doesn't strike me that either of you are that invested in repairing it.

This next part I want to tread carefully, and I hope I don't offend you or anyone.  Me, I've got an anxiety disorder and a mood disorder.  A lot of simple interactions people don't even think about are a complete struggle for me.  I have to analyze lots of things to make sure I picked up on everything and so I don't react disproportionately.  I work really hard on managing it, and for the most part, I do OK.  I used to not tell anyone in the world about it, and that led to problems.  People had the impression that I was standoffish or were insulted.  I lost good friends and opportunities.  

So now, I tell certain people close to me in my own ways.  I don't tell them my diagnoses or my medication or that I go to group therapy every week. I tell them what they need to know.  ""Hey, look.  Sometimes I do this thing where I don't react right away.  I",Human
573rfr,"Thank you for that--I'll try to see if she's open to talking about this further.

That does seem to be a frequent sticking point when dealing with this individual--lack of communication. You don't seem too open to further communication yourself, but I'll try to look elsewhere for advice on how to open the field.

And no, your response was not unnecessarily long (as far as I can tell). I appreciate the context and examples.",Human
573rfr,"Perhaps it wasn't her boyfriend, but rather the guy she's seeing behind his back...  Then again, it's none of your business who she's talking to.  Either way, she sounds like a massive cunt and you should just tell her to go fuck herself.",Human
573rfr,gal got issues ,Human
573rfr,"Not the asshole

I was in a position like this once. My flatmate confronted me about a few things, but one of them was because I told one of our friends that about his secret girlfriend who I: 1. Didn't know wasn't a secret at all. And 2. Mentioned her because the friend said to me that she doesn't see much of him these days which is why I responded with ""I'm guessing he's been with (girl's name)"". 

Yeah it's probably not great to speculate but I didn't think it was a big deal, it's not like I said he was probably out doing cocaine.

If you wanna know about the other things, I did tell another friend who I thought knew something about him about someone else accidentally spilling the beans to someone else. But that guy instantly went off and told the first friend mentioned what I said in a ""he said something about you kind of way"". 

Why I mention this is because even though this was cleared up and all was ""forgiven"", he held it against me when I had a bone to pick with him, and being the pushover I was back then, I just laid back and accepted it. 

So no, you're not the asshole. There was just a misunderstanding, but she's an asshole for assuming the worst in you and expecting you to be the one to come clean. There's a way to react to someone saying you've been on the phone to your bf and it's not to act immature. ",Human
573rfr,"That was my thought too, that she's cheating on her bf and is angry about (in her mind) being caught. But yes, either way, OP is not the asshole.",Human
573rfr,"Nope - it seems like this chick is perpetually in need of drama in her life, and she creates big insults out of minuscule problems.  I'd avoid her as much as possible, don't take it personally when she is constantly mad (because there's nothing you can do about it anyways), and don't let it consume your life.  People like that are always unhappy because they cling to any excuse to be in a fight with people.  If you stop caring, she'll move on to someone else to be mad at because she can get a reaction out of them, and eventually she will alienate everyone and move on to what she will call a ""less toxic environment"" so she can start the cycle anew.

As a bonus, when she eventually confronts you because you aren't tiptoeing around her like a nervous mouse, you can tell her that you've accepted that she doesn't like you and realized that you don't like her either.  She will take great offense to this and demand to know why, and you can just say ""oh, our personalities just don't mesh very well.  That's ok, because you don't have to mesh to have a good working relationship, and I respect you very much as a coworker.  We just aren't going to click very well as friends.""  If she pushes further you can tell her that you like a very calm social environment and low levels of anxiety, and she seems to like a very active social life with a lot going on.  She'll probably try and twist that to create drama, but you've already let go of trying to be her friend, so whatevs.",Human
575ixz,"No,you're not the asshole. I think you're right to be upset. But I also think that your major issue is not that, but that you seem to be in a one-sided friendship. If I were you I would get out of that relationship. ",Human
575ixz,"Not really an asshole, just someone who should understand that she doesn't *owe* you anything. If she doesn't want to share her life for whatever reason (whether you perceive it as valid or not), she's fine. She's especially justified if you have a prior romantic history (e.g. turning you down). It sounds like you value the friendship more than she does. ",Human
575ixz,Could you elaborate? One sided how exactly?,Human
575ixz,"Her explanation seems to bear a certain degree of verity, even a cuteness, and I (would) sorta believed in her. But I guess it is also normal to be resented in this case as you are waiting a response to your shares. It really differs on the articulations of context, I guess. So I think it is not necessarily a unilateral relationship as others suggested (or as maybe a part of you implied). She just, in a sense, approached your particularity as a case; as a you being rejected: she triumphed rejection. Its sole context is rejection and maybe a degree of suffering attached to it, and it in that sense, ultimately, excludes her happiness. On the other hand, you approached all those initiatives of affairs as an attempt for a love, as intimate feelings all in their particularity. But you had already crushed all those moments when you share, just don't forget--but anyways. Probably in intent, you would like to share a community with your friend---through those loves, in their immediate intimacy; while she approached you through their result; rejection. Neither of you are assholes. I would humbly suggest you to lessen a degree of emphases on endings, and if exists victimization; and for her to increase the degree of direct affection (especially on processes as they unfold on that moment, as themselves excluding any conception). I am a little drunk now, but I hope I could explain a little.

575ixz,"That's kind of why I made the post in the first place because I also feel that she doesn't owe me anything but I she always told me pretty much anything that happened in her life or what was on her mind, so me being mad now kind of made me feel like an asshole.

That being said, I don't think I value the friendship more than she does because; whenever we fight or I get mad, she is terrified of losing me (according to her friends atleast)",Human

575ixz,"Well, this is just my opinion. I could totally be wrong. But from what I can gather it seems like you're willing to share with Beth more than what's she's willing to share with you. This may (or may not) be an indication that she may be not sharing about other things as well. If this is in fact the case, then you don't want to be in a relationship where you appreciate and trust the other person more than they appreciate and trust you. You deserve better. That is, if that's the case. ",Human
575ixz,"Yeah you're right, it does sometimes feel like that and she kind of confirmed it when I was leaving when I went to talk to her about the situation in the OP. She started crying because she felt like I was putting more effort into this friendship and despite her trying to help me or not hurt me (for instance by keeping this a secret from me) she ends up hurting me or whatever.

I'm fully aware that this isn't the healthiest of relationships but I'm hard pressed to let it go",Human
575ixz,Oh sorry just saw this after I edited all around for 18 minutes:) I hope edits helped.,Human
575ixz,"Sorry, OP. Hope it gets better or you find a way to let it go. You seem like a great person. ",Human
575ixz,"Hehe yes this makes a bit more sense and I might have implied it but I don't really think our relationship is unilateral, we both get a lot out of it. I also do believe that she really did it to kind of spare my feelings because I've had so much rejection the past couple of years, as you suggested.

I'm, however, still a bit lost with your conclusion, what exactly do you mean with a focus on endings?",Human
575ixz,Thank you very much. :),Human
575ixz,"No I neither think your relationship is unilateral, that was my rejection as to previous comments, as they seem they were suggesting that.

Or ok, let's try this, I tried to do a different summary. I think she *may be* embarrassed that she has a new affair. I guess this is because she thought you don't have an affair. So only determinant here for her is the end-result: the existence of an affair. But you thought that you shared with her the processes, not the end results of affairs. That is to say you thought you shared with her your feelings, of all those frustrations, thrills, excitements; so that is to say you feel as you shared with her the affairs in their immediacy. But she conceptualized them as suffering, as a suffering of rejections, so she took them as end-results. So I guessed two things would play role in this: either you emphasize results more, or she conceptualized more. So I guessed maybe it would both be a case, and tried to point out a humble suggestion; that you to over-emphasize results less (if you do); and she to communicate with your feelings in their immediacy more (without end-results but more with the process as it feels)---as all an affair already, despite rejected. Something like that. Hope that helped.

edit or tl;dr: so the conflict seems to me that you see those as affections, while she sees them as rejections. I guess you are right more, but she can have her reasons.",Human
575ixz,"It's actually amazing how accurate your comment is because this is pretty much exactly how I shared those experiences with her and, looking back at a couple of other situations, how I think her thought process went whenever I told her about my affairs and how they eventually ended in rejection.

That aside, reading your comment again, I realise that yes, I think she might be embarrassed that she is seeing someone. When I wanted to ask for more details her boyfriend she told me she wasn't ready to talk about it yet

Again, I'm really surprised how accurate this comment is, idk if you're always like this or you change a lot when you become drunk, but you're a very intelligent person",Human

However, if that communication turned into a fight, then clearly you pushed the issue a little too far and made the both of you upset. It sounds like you may have treaded into asshole territory.

I guess the reason we aren't talking is because of me, I feel like she betrayed my trust by hidding this from me, someone who she calls her best friend. I know it sounds arrogant and as someone else mentionned, she doesn't owe me anything.",Human

But. 
Have you said things recently about your own situation to make her cautious? How would you have responded if she had, in fact, told you? If in the past you have responded badly in a similar situation, she might have been channeling that. 
I'm not saying you did. Just something that crossed my mind. 
It's perfectly understandable that your feelings were hurt. But it doesn't sound intentional, it was just an unforseen and unfortunate side affect of her trying to watch out for your feelings- and IMO, a friend who watches out for your feelings is a good friend to have.

In the past when she was seeing someone I always reacted possitively to it and I'd support her in her choice, just like she does.

He charges more than eBay? Big deal. Either no one will buy from him because of that, or they'll negotiate a lower price. He seemed to indicate he was open to negotiation on the price, so his prices really weren't set in stone.

Also, if you're afraid of buying from sellers on this site because it doesn't offer sufficient protection, then don't buy from them.

57djaq,You could have maybe worded it differently but I think your intention was admirable. You could also try asking the woman (if this comes up again ) if she needs someone to call her a cab etc. I think it's great for people to check in on other people when they are incapacitated. ,Human
57djaq,"Rather than ""Don't you think she's too drunk?"" You could try ""Do you need my help getting her back to her place safely?"" I'm glad there's guys out there who want to look out for the girls who are too drunk, but you probably could have gone about this differently. You had good intentions, but you offended your friend and made a pretty shocking assumption about his behavior. You weren't an asshole for your concern, just maybe the way that you expressed it.",Human
57djaq,"Very true. Phrasing it differently made it sound much better.

I don't know Ben, he was a different guy than the person I spoke in Skype with. I made a small edit to my post to hopefully clear up some confusion.",Human

In my circles being a white knight has a negative connotation when a guy protects a woman because they are just hoping that playing the hero will get them laid.  

You were being nice to both Janet and Ben even if they didn't see it that way.  I have more concerns for your friend who called you a sjw. That type of thinking is what leads to others ignoring a situation and allows for something bad to happen.  

If I ever got that drunk in public again I hope I have people around me like you.  ",Human
57djaq,"&gt;My friend told me that he thought I was a complete prick for doing that to Ben and a ""sjw"".

Your friend is the prick. Anyone unironically using ""SJW"" to describe someone attempting to stop a possible rape is an asshole. You were asking a very reasonable question; the fact that Ben got offended rather than just confused suggests he might have had more in mind, in my opinion.",Human

Now the issue of social justice warriors has gotten out of hand, so don't worry about being branded one of those, you're still entitled to say and do what you feel is right. White-knighting is almost the opposite of what you did, you didn't want to sleep with Janet or gain her affection, in fact you were making sure one stranger wouldn't take advantage of another. Of course you didn't have to, but you did, so what? And honestly? I think you did a good thing, and your friend was probably being defensive because he wanted Ben to score one for the team.",Human

57djaq,"Joining the chorus: Your friend is the asshole. Accusing anyone of being an ""sjw"" is honestly a little preposterous, especially when his complaint is that you checked on an intoxicated person to be sure they were not being taken advantage of.

Everybody else was fine. You risked being a bit rude to Ben, given that you didn't know the circumstances (he could have been her brother, for example). That said, it was for a worthy cause and you didn't unduly intrude beyond just checking everyone was OK. You get an A+.",Human

She may be an adult, yes. But the reason you were concerned to begin with was that she was drunk. She CANNOT ""make her own decisions"" (I.e., consent) under those circumstances.

But honestly, good on ya for speaking up!",Human

You need to defend yourself against allegations like that, and based on what OP said about his reaction I wouldn't say that we have any idea what his intentions were.

I do agree that OP's friend is the prick though. OP, all you did was try to make sure that a drunk girl got home okay. I think it's messed up that your friend sees any issue with that, and to me is a pretty big red flag about how he would act in a similar situation.",Human

She's not asking you for a green card marriage.

Even though she can't change the circumstance she's still basically giving you an ultimatum. Marriage, break up, or long distance until eventual marriage or break up.

Two people love each other, one wants to get married but the other doesn't believe in marriage. The one who wants to get married is allowed to be upset about that. (However, that doesn't mean they can be an asshole about it. But it's reasonable to be hurt or upset about that.)

People are allowed to be mad when they're hurt. You just can't take it out on other people. However, OPs situation is different. She's getting mad that he won't do something legally binding just so she can stay in his country easier, and she's taking it out on him.",Human

Just keep an open mind and take opportunities to meet and understand all kinds of people and you'll probably find your biases start becoming less relevant (though other biases might become more so.

How could she be expected to think that you view your clothes as private when you bring them to her house and have her help with laundry?

That likely made up a significant portion of her life, and with you all being grown and out on your own, she no longer feels relevant or useful.  

Especially being that I assume she's retired, she no longer has kids or grandchildren to care for, and no job, so it's probably a bit depressing.  Not trying to make generalities, and this likely does not apply to everyone, but in speaking for myself, I get depressed if I have too much time off and not enough to do as I feel like I'm wasting my life.  I can only imagine being retired and having all the time in the world, with no one to dote on.

It is understandably frustrating to have things messed with like that, but she's probably just wanting to still feel like she's needed.

58b7on,"You're not the asshole. 

If I understand you right, you're using your dryer, in your house, and not doing so at inconsiderate times. I don't see anyway that makes you an asshole. 

To address the specific complaints: 

You claim the dryer use doesn't affect the utility bills. If you're using it a regular amount, the effect is probably negligible. More importantly, I'm sure each of your roommates uses energy in a different category that surpasses your use in that category. For instance, your roommate who is home more frequently may need the lights on more frequently than you, or have their computer plugged in more. 

As for roommate 3 not liking the noise, assuming you are not running the dryer late at night or other inconsiderate times, that's just the burden of having roommates. You can ask for quiet, and at a certain point at night it should be expected to have quiet, but all roommates should have the same rights in the living space. If you get home by 7, you should be able to have a load of laundry done by 9 easily. I don't think it's reasonable to expect silence before then from roommates anyway.

Finally, on the environment. Your roommate doesn't get control over you actions. If she can convince you the dryer is bad enough for the environment that you shouldn't use it, then don't. But just because she doesn't like it doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. She's vegan, are you?

Yes it probably is, but I know that when I was a student small things like this would bother me over time. Having things like lights on and laptops plugged in are *way* cheaper than running the dryer.

OP, I suggest that you and your housemates devise a system whereby you pay some small amount (e.g. about $0.50) into a kitty when ever you use the dryer, to be used on house purchases. I've done similar things to this in houseshares before and it makes everybody feel better, since they're getting some benefit from using it less rather than just paying a (slightly) larger bill every month due to your own use.

58w68u,"I don't understand, that conversation seemed completely civil.  Why would you think either of you were assholes?

Keep in mind, the name of this subreddit is ""Am I the Asshole"" not ""Am I Correct.""  It doesn't really matter if his views are scientific or not, the only thing that matters for the purpose of this sub is how you two approach the disagreement.  From what I saw, unless you guys aren't talking now because of it or something, neither of you are assholes.",Human
58w68u,"Well, I should say that I think I *am* more sensitive to conflicts like this, and without resolution, these things may noticeably color my interactions with the friend in the future. I also intentionally mask my ""instinctual"" responses to things in the name of politeness and proper conduct. Several times in this conversation I held my tongue because I knew what I really wanted to say wasn't rationally productive.

I never could identify with those friends who can get into violent conflicts with each other, but by the end of it be totally cool with it (""Well, I gotta get going to class. We cool?"" ""Yeah, we're cool.""), even if the topic of conflict hasn't been resolved.

Still, though you say this conversation is completely civil, I feel like if I acted like this on a regular basis with people (or even worse, said what I wanted to say without carefully choosing my words like a politician, as is my habit), I would have even fewer friends than I already do.

As for why I think I might be an asshole, it's because I intentionally turned a conversation into a debate about his beliefs. As for why I think he might be an asshole, it's because I think he not only lacks reasoning, but tact in responding to me on a rational basis.",Human
58w68u,"I don't think you're an asshole. I do think you wrongly accused him of an ad hominem where the guy was pretty obviously just trying to introduce a parallel (i.e non-evidence-based faith - I think what he was reaching for was a sort of bastardized version of the precautionary principle).

At the very end you do bring a moral imperative into it with the word ""oughtn't"" (""ought"" has a moral connotation that ""should"" doesn't have) but you phrased it as a question, so that was still not really assholish. 

I think at its basis though the two of you were proceeding with very different underlying assumptions about what is ideal or good, and that's why the conversation has that feeling of friction to it.",Human
58w68u,"Perhaps he just meant to bring up a parallel with religion. Though, I'm inclined to believe he would've phrased it differently (""What about Christianity?"" versus ""Well, you're a Christian"") or explained it further if he didn't mean to point it specifically at me. He has a history of disparaging religion, not bringing it up as a tradition to be respected. He also ended on a note that declares the same thing: ""You're nowhere better with your own beliefs.""

I'm interested, though, in your observation that we ""proceed with very different underlying assumptions about what is ideal or good."" What do you think I should do about that, if I'm annoyed by his underlying assumptions and I think they're wrong and destructive? Keep in mind this is a friend I like to be rather open with, rather than just a dude to hang around with.",Human
58w68u,"You know him and I don't so you would know his intentions. (The Christianity thing seemed like a natural parallel to me, though, given what you were talking about, and likening himself to you in that way seemed more like an attempt to find common ground than to disparage).

He seemed to me to not be particularly good at articulating issues (whether that's from a lack of practice at critical thinking, or just poor expression, is unclear from here).

&gt;What do you think I should do about that, if I'm annoyed by his underlying assumptions and I think they're wrong and destructive?

I think there's a huge difference between 1) letting someone know what your own  ideas are and how your ideas differ from their ideas; 2) *explicitly* letting them know that you think their ideas are wrong; and 3) trying to get them to change their ideas and follow yours instead.


In a friendship you really do need to use judgment about what actually warrants going beyond 1, and whether it needs to go to 2 or all the way to 3. Given that you have used the word ""destructive"", for example I would look at whether that destruction is potential or actual, what exactly is being destroyed, what the knock-on effects are, what the magnitude of that is. And whether you are primarily acting as his friend, for the greater good, to protect specific people, and so on.",Human
58ylm0,"Not an asshole. You're an adult who has the right to decide the course of their own life. Your parents have been in denial and are upset that your post brought the topic into the real world. They'll probably continue to be upset for a while, and there's probably not a lot you can do about it, just grit your teeth and get through it. I would try to stay calm during this discussion you're going to have with your mom - don't blame her for being in denial, just calmly state the facts and maybe reiterate that you'll still be around for Sunday dinner sometimes or whatever. Don't expect anything you say to change her mind, just try not to let it escalate. Good luck, dude.",Human
58ylm0,"150% not the asshole. Your parents need to let go, yesterday. You're 21, that's 3 years to get used to you being an adult. Just move out on your planned schedule and call them sometimes.

58ylm0,"From the information here, not an asshole.  If you're a self sufficient adult your parents have exactly fuck all say in where you live or how you conduct yourself online.  I'm not saying burn bridges with them, but i would establish some hard and fast boundaries now so they understand that you and only you are in charge of your life.  ",Human
58ylm0,"If you have truly tried to discuss this with your parents and they refused to hear you out, then you are definitely not the asshole! It sounds like your parents are just struggling to think of you as an adult, and not their baby boy/girl. 

From my experience with my own parents (who admittedly sound quite different from yours) they didn't really think of me as anything but their baby girl until I moved out. Once I had been settled in my own place with my own job for a bit they kind of had a reality slap in the face like ""Oh dang, she's a woman now."" And now we have an adult daughter and parent relationship, which is much different and much better for everyone.

Best of luck!! And congrats on moving out.",Human
58ylm0,"Not the asshole.

As you said, it might be hard for your parents to get used to the fact that you won't be living with them any more, but becoming adults and making their own lives is what people do.

58ylm0,"Well now that you're an adult time to step up and care for your parents like they're normal people going through something hard. So what if it has to do with you directly. Take care of them and help them through this. And move the fuck out. You're not an asshole. But your still acting like a child for only acting on your own behalf.
When I became 21 and would get lectured by my parents... I would help them and teach them how to handle difficult situations... even if it was me inciting the difficulty. Inciting the difficulty doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong. It's like you said, there comes a time... the time you exhibit freedom of speech and expression of personality on the internet... the time the bird leaves the nest.
I'm saying you're perfectly fine leaving tomorrow. But do so with some goddamn grace. You're 21. Step up and be the man or woman your parents could see leading a life of your own choosing. Prove you can do fine through your character. When you speak to them, refuse the child/parent talk and only allow friend/friend talk. This is how 21+ yr old adults talk to each other. Be smart and realize this.",Human
58ylm0,"This is interesting advice, but helpful. Thank you.

I've tried talking to them on a human-to-human level. I've even asked that of them specifically, and they've refused. I'm not exactly what to do in that sense.",Human

The world comes and you must receive it. This need not influence or affect you. Remain open and vulnerable and let the externals flow through you. Your composure will become charged as you witness this. Resistance is an attribute of the child.",Human

For reference, they are both valid, I've done quite a few university level math courses and I've had professors do both ways, it's just a preference.  Your wife's way is just a drawn out version of what you are doing, you are just skipping showing some steps.

To you it might seem like 500- (-100) is just 500--100, which is just 500+100, but her way does the exact same thing and thus gets the exact same result.

Your method is essentially the same as hers.  The only difference is she writes down a step that it so simple most people would do it in their head, unless they were doing a proof for math class.",Human
58yxl4,Thanks for the insight. ,Human
58yxl4,"It's definitely not a big deal as long as you get the same answer.  If she used the same rule on a different math problem and got a wrong answer, or if you could think of a time when this rule yielded a wrong answer then you could point it out and use it to prove your point, but it's more likely that it doesn't matter, and possible that she's actually *more* correct than you.  

Do you open the dishwasher sometimes after she's loaded and run it, and see that all the dishes are clean, but then yell at her because the forks are in the first silverware compartment instead of the second one, the way *you* always do it?

Negatives don't just ""cancel out"" like some hocus pocus bullshit. There's a fundamental operation at work. Your ""trick"" is valid, but a quick shortcut nonetheless. The outside negative is multiplied by the inside negative. A negative sign doesn't just exist as a number, thus it has an associated (although unnecessary to write) number 1 associated to it. Your wife is still dumb for showing this step. Like seriously, who would rewrite the equation with a 1...

58z04n,"Your friend isn't an asshole, nor are you. Your friend is, however, a SJW. You didn't ask for her number or whistle. You didn't follow her. You didn't say anything explicitly or implicitly sexual. Sounds like a compliment to me. 

If I HAD to be a cynic, I'd say calling her red dress wasn't the most tactful way to introduce a compliment.

Not an asshole maybe tactless",Human
58z04n,"Kind of an asshole. I don't think you were trying to be mean, but drunkenly screaming at a woman across the street feels really different when you're a woman walking at night than when you're the drunken dude. You might like a compliment hollered at you at night because you're not normally worried about your physical safety when you're out walking around. What if you were walking along and there was a group of big drunk guys across the street who shouted out that they really liked the phone you were carrying? Sure, it's a compliment, but you'd also wonder if they were interested in trying to straight-up *take* that phone from you. 

I don't think you're a bad person for doing this - hell, I've done things like this myself in the past - but I do think you need to be more aware of how your actions look and feel to other people. We dudes need to remember that women in these situations have an undercurrent of fear that we simply don't have to worry about, and we need to take that into account. ",Human
58z04n,So your criteria for a compliment is anything that's not an actual crime?,Human
58z04n,"As I said, there was nothing implicitly or explicitly sexual about the comment. That isn't illegal either. Get the stick from out of your ass.",Human
58z04n,"It doesn't have to be explicitly sexual to be bad. If someone much bigger and stronger than me yelled that he liked my hair it would be fucking creepy. 

Your problem is you're either unwilling or unable to empathize. ",Human
58z04n,"Your* problem is that you're generalizing the reactions of women. As a women who has experienced this, I can tell the difference between creepy and compliment. You're trying to empathize with all women, with is why your idea of ""empathy"" is irrelevant.",Human
58z04n,"I never said anything about the reactions of women. I spoke only about how i would feel as a man in an effort to explain why the reaction of OP's friends made sense and to counter your point that a comment is only wrong if it carries an explicit sexual element. 

Your whole counterpoint is basically an argument to something i never said. 

However to address your completely tangential and also very wrong claim, just because you personally don't feel that way doesn't mean it's alright to go around doing it. 

Numerous Sources ( linked at bottom) have provided strong evidence that the majority of women do no appreciate catcalling and that it in fact makes women feel fearful and unsafe.  Therefore your personal interjection that it's okay for you is not only not applicable to the general public but also a great example of your inability to empathize.

I believe this is a feminist sub. Either that, or there's a feminist brigade that trolls around Reddit looking for ""oppression"".

Believe it or not, but your feelings and thoughts do align with the majority of women across the world.

This new wave of feminism we're seeing, along with its SJW counterparts, are honestly a very small minority... albeit very *loud*.

If you've ever heard the term ""basement dweller"", it applies here.

If you spend any amount of time online, it'll seem like the entire world aligns with this new SJW way of thinking, but the truth is, they represent such a small percentage of the population that you can literally dismiss the notion of it and continue on in your life without being impacted in any meaningful way.

No one is going to approach you in real life and tell you your conservative beliefs are triggering them and tell you you're a mysoginist woman.

And honestly, women are leaving feminism in droves because they're realizing how cancerous of a movement it is and the only people who *really* believe in it are the basement dwellers of society who really have no hold in real life in any way worth mentioning.

I applaud you for sticking up for yourself in this thread, even with the SJWs tag-teaming you.

You just need to understand that moving home to save money means that in exchange you're going to need to run errands and help out your parents. It's usually about the same amount of time you'd spend cleaning and doing groceries if you lived on your own anyways, and you probably get away with doing errands that are a lot better than scrubbing a toilet or cleaning an oven.

As for spending time with them, maybe try and find some time in your schedule to put aside just to hang out with them. Once you graduate you won't see them as often and you'll really wish you would have spent more time.",Human

I would say definitely try helping out with chores or errands because I feel like it's the least you can do as they have let you live with them and save money, plus you mentioned that they aren't college grads so I'm gonna guess they don't have a ton of extras but they are willing to give you what they can.


  You aren't an asshole for not wanting to spend time with them, I think that's kind of normal really, but I promise you that one day you'll be sad that you didn't and wish for the chance to just sit with them again.  Everyone always thinks they're guaranteed time and it sucks when the option to do something you thought you'd get around to one day gets pulled from the table.


 
  The other thing is why can't you show you're parents all the work you need to do, like physically show them how much you must read and whatever projects you are working on, maybe if you did that they'd stop expecting you to do all the things they saddle you with now.

This bad joke is apparently quite popular among teachers. I had at least a couple in high school tell some variation of this. ",Human
592inx,"It's even worse from teachers as they have such influence. I'm a teacher now myself and I try really hard to watch what I say and be aware of any biases I have.

Once when I was a student, another student asked what they do on planes when someone is a danger to other passengers (since you can't exactly kick them out easily). I told them they restrain them to their seat (they have restraints for this purpose). The teacher overheard and said ""But how could they? They're all women."" I said ""If they worked together they would stand a better chance, plus there are some male flight attendants too."" and he said ""Yeah but they're all gay."" I said ""...what? No they're not. Why would that even matter."" and he said ""If they're gay they won't be strong enough to restrain a big guy."" I said, ""You're totally full of shit!"" and he said something about how his sister worked for an airline and it was all true and then the bell rung so I left, furious. A classroom of kids, some of whom will be gay, can hear you you absolute arsewipe! I'm glad I spoke up.",Human
592inx,"Playing devil's advocate here but is it actually sexist for him to point out social differences between the sexes? Is it not a fact that men and women problem solve and handle conflict in different manners? 

Also, is this guy older? There could be a generational divide. It doesn't make him justified or right or wrong I'm merely pointing out the reason behind his comments and the grey area between offensive and it offensive. 

And why is it offensive to you? Does it affect your life? Is his comment due to his own personal observations over the course of his life or does he really just hate women? People are so jump to conclusions in every direction.

Again, I am not advocating for any sexism or anything but I am advocating for calling it out when it truly matters and/or when it is clear and actually hurtful.

The OP's situation as described in his post (may have been different in person at the time it happened) should not be considered offensive. I don't think it disparages (or was meant to) anyone by what the teacher said. I know from my own life experience that there are different dynamics and methods of conflict resolution between different groups of people. This is simply how society operates and it seems like this guy merely commented on it based on his own experiences. Sure, it's a broad and general statement but he's not calling anyone any derogatory names etc. 

Perhaps some kind of anthropologist (or whomever would be an expert on human interaction) can weigh in on this and determine if he was out of line or not. I feel like people of all kinds are too quick to cry foul these days and it's losing it's impact. I also think in life, it's acceptable to be offended at times. But how it's handled it important. 

People these days seem to think that being offended by something entitles them to act in certain ways and then the point is lost. You are entitled to your opinions just as the other person is entitled to theirs.

It's ok to have thicker skin. Also there really isn't free speech in a classroom. It's the teacher's domain. I still fail to see how the comments were even sexist.

Clearly you and I differ in opinion and your vocabulary is more refined than mine. My whole point is that people take offense too easily as of late and it's really counter productive.

However, I think you misunderstood the prior comment. Properly understood, it wasn't a fallacy at all because there were unspoken premises which you missed.

*Preliminary: not the argument itself*

Casual sexism exists.

Casual sexism has different types of impacts. 

Type 1: hurts women.

Type two: hurts listeners by making them mildly sexist.

This would lead to them not understanding the first type of impact.

*Actual argument:*

In order to prove (or support) the hypothesis about the second type of impact, let's look for some real instances.

Here we have an example in (other redditor).

Let me point out that it's not a deductive argument, it's inductive.
",Human
592inx,"The type two impact isn't really what's being said -- which, mind you, doesn't mean the poster disagrees that it exists, but rather, they're stating something entirely different. This is what the poster says: ""... the fact you don't see how it's offensive is demonstrative of the fact casual sexist(sic) [...] does make an impact."" In other words, casual sexism has the impact of causing people to become oblivious to their own sexism. They're not saying here that witnessing sexism causes sexism, but rather, being sexist causes someone to not realize it. 
The claim lacks falsifiability. I can claim endlessly that you're sexist, and the reason you won't ever realize it is because your own sexism blocks you from ever coming to that realization. Your own denial is further evidence that you are.",Human

In fact, history is filled with -- almost entirely made up of -- incidents where men have hated one another and done dreadful things to indulge their long standing grudges.

It doesn't seem like this girl really cares about you. It's more like she's using you to get validation. To feel wanted. Because you seem a little desperate.

I was like, what a bitch, how could you just tell me to get over it, like it's that easy.  Eventually, I did get over it, whatever it was, and realized that it really was the best advice.  So, no offense, but, get over it.

She clearly isn't a good friend, and even if you really like her, you deserve better, so move on, but don't let it drag you down.  As long as you take care of yourself, and are in a good position to be good for yourself by yourself, all sorts of good things in the world will be attracted to the positive energy you're putting out, and good things will come to you, including relationships, and friendships, and everything else you really want and need.  But you've gotta take care of *you* first.

It's like anything, you wouldn't decide to go hang out in a shitty neighborhood or part of town, because it looks shitty, why would you go there?  But if you see a shiny new car, or a person who is smiling and happy and confident, you would be like, oh cool, I'd love to have that car, or I'd love to have that happy person for a friend.  

Be that car, be that person.  It *really is* that easy.

Fake it until you make it.",Human
598ltw,"Thanks for your advice. I think small steps are the path for me. I want to get over it. I realize that the big roadblock in my way is me. Life should take care of itself, I just have to be the catalyst for change.",Human
598ltw,"You are not, but you gotta forget this girl if she doesnt acknowledge you or is not a true friend that you can rely on with regards to your depression. This is a relationship (friend wise) where you are putting all the effort in it while she couldnt give 2 shits about it. Imagine all the shit you would have to deal with if you were in a relationship. Bullet dodged imo. This is not a healthy relationship for you. You are settling for her attention. Dont.",Human
5993x9,"I think you are far from an asshole, you were understanding and tried to communicate.

Your argument about having to pay more for a double room than for a triple room + the fact your school has a rule of others not sleeping over more than three times a week gives you the right in this situation.

maybe the girl should pay you the difference of a triple to double room or tell her about the rules and say if nothing changes you will go to some kind of dorm-principal


If the girl has problems with her dorm mates she shouldn't make you ""pay"" for it",Human
5993x9,"You are not the asshole. Even if he were staying within the rules, in my opinion staying over 3 days a week is too much. If I were you I would probably ask her, or ask him to ask her, to contribute towards your rent since she's there so often. But I wouldn't feel at all bad reporting them to your residence adviser (or whoever) for breaking the rules.

He's pushing your limit and he knows it. He's trying to shift the blame onto you, and that makes him the asshole. Other people would have stopped putting up with it long ago.",Human
5993x9,"That's a rough situation, but it seems like in OP's case it has gone on more than long enough for such a situation to be resolved by now. ",Human
5993x9,"Everyone who's commented so far has said ""no, you're not the asshole, she should help with rent!"", which I think is just silly. This is college. It's freshman year, in fact. The fact of the matter is that your roommate is paying for his half of the room as well, and it's his right to have his girlfriend over (even if you don't like it).

I think neither of you are being assholes here. He's just trying to have fun and live his life and have some new experiences. It just so happens that he has a roommate with an incompatible lifestyle. I can appreciate where you're coming from though, I had an absolutely terrible roommate freshman year of college. The school has policies in place to allow you to seek remediation of these situations (such as requesting a room change). It's also an important life skill to learn to deal with these situations, as they really never stop coming up. You have a few choices here:

1. Talk to the roommate again, but frame it differently: ""look man I need time to do my own thing sometimes, when your gf stays over can you guys stay out of the room until 11 p.m""?

2. You can find somewhere else to hang out between the time she comes over and you go to bed... this isn't going to last forever, just until you can get a room change or until the end of the year. There are plenty of places to go. My freshman year, when we didn't have ID to get into the bars or we wanted to stay in but the dorm was rowdy, we'd rent a study room with a projector for 6 hours on a Fr",Human
5993x9,"I mostly agree with your points, but it's actually not the roommate's right to have his girlfriend over that often, as OP stated. Likely the school has these policies in place to prevent exactly this situation. I don't think the roommate is an asshole for wanting to spend time with his girlfriend, but  I think he is an asshole for openly flouting the rules when OP has clearly stated he's not OK with it.",Human
5993x9,"And even if it didn't, I don't see why OP's roommate and his girlfriend couldn't be a little more considerate. Just acknowledging the problem and trying to make up for it in some way, like paying extra rent, would probably make the whole situation easier for everyone involved.",Human
5993x9,"You're not the asshole here. In my opinion, the ball is in your roommate's court. He has to acknowledge that this situation is a problem for you and at least attempt to make some concessions, for example covering part of your rent, even if it's just symbolic.",Human
5993x9,"Listen it's the beginning of the year. Talk to your RA and see if you can change rooms. Don't let this ruin your whole freshman year. He's going to want his girlfriend over especially if he is getting laid. You are not going to want her over if she's over a lot. It seems like your priorities are different so why don't you just change your environment. I know you are going  to say you don't want to move, it's a pain, it's a hassle, but which is worse? Spending a whole year with an extra person in your room or packing your shit up and moving it down the hall?",Human
5993x9,What kind of pros and cons are you taking about. ,Human
5993x9,While i am really sorry that you had that experience as it truly sounds awful I still believe it is wrong to put that on your boyfriends roommate. If he was fine with it then power to you and nothing is wrong but I have made it very clear that i'm not ok with her sleeping over this much. I don't think i'm that close to being an asshole (but i could well be wrong). Like I said in the original post the week he told me of her roommate trouble I tried to be understanding but since then nothing has changed and if anything it has gotten worse. ,Human
5993x9,"of the triple? From the school website:
Volunteers will receive $500 off your Fall semester meal plan,
A free MicroFridge, Volunteers will receive free summer housing during the summer between freshman and sophomore year if they choose to enroll in summer session courses and it costs considerably less than a double. I get none of these!

The disadvantages are that you are in a triple which is the only effect i've gotten from this entire thing",Human
5993x9,"Oh so you actually have triple rooms there. If the only downside is having another person in the room, I don't think it is that bad",Human
5993x9,"I understand that point but I didn't sign up for a triple, I signed up (and payed a lot of money for) a double I don't think it's too much to ask for what I payed for. Especially when I have to pay so much for it.",Human
5993x9,I think you have the right to complain though in this case,Human
5993x9,"Thanks for the reply. First off everytime i've talked with him i've tried to be nice about it and so far it hasn't turned into a fight but the last time we talked it felt rather hostile. Secondly I wouldn't want to either break them up or get either of them in trouble. I don't necessarily disagree with the people saying she should comp me for a triple price but I almost definitely won't be doing that because 1) the hassle would be too much and 2) It sounds like that is too awkward a talk for me to have. As far as befriending him goes we are not unfriendly but he really isn't my type of person and we really hardly ever talk and that is something i'm completely ok with and I think he probably is too. Lastly the trying to find a place to hang out while they are around, I personally think that is really dumb (no offense) It's my room too and I have every right to be in it as much as I want. There have already been about 3-4 times where I come back from class and they are being intimate and i'm kicked out of my room for like an hour which really annoyed me. I get kids will be kids and that kids that age do that stuff and it honestly didn't even annoy me the first time but being kicked out of my room that much did start to get to me. Overall while i do disagree with you a fair amount thanks for the reply and the effort you put into it!

Not unreasonable for her to keep in touch for a while to make sure everything is ok with the puppy, if you have any questions, etc. But after a bit I'd expect something like ""Sounds like everyone is happy and healthy, feel free to give me a call or text if you run into any issues or questions."", and then leave you alone.",Human

59cxqo,Not the asshole. What kind of texts was she sending,Human
59cxqo,"Just ""how's the puppy?"" ""What did you name the puppy?"" ""How are things?"" which is normal and polite, but it was over, and over, and over, and over, like a weird amount of times. ",Human

(I would understand her being more protective if it was just the one dog or a close pet, but she had about ten of them and was very expressive about just wanting them gone (was giving them up at six weeks).

Yes, we understand. But you could still clearly tell her.",Human

I dunno, it would be WAY different if I had bought a vacuum from her or something, then she'd be a creepy bitch asking me every day ""Hows that vacuum"" , but the fact that it was the exchange of a living animal makes it a weird situation.(which I feel like that part is almost pointless considering as I said in the last comment that in person she didn't seem to really give two shits and just wanted the dog gone.)",Human

59e2d2,"If you stopped singing it that way and had a rational discussion with your friend about each of your beliefs, then no.

59e2d2,"Just for saying that line? No. I do think you are at risk of being an asshole, however, if you're not willing to listen to someone's response to the things you say.

You say it ""had nothing to do with religions,"" but you must realize that most people would see that as a rejection of the primary belief of any monotheistic religion. Which is a fine position to have, but you can't expect everyone to accept it without disagreement or not view it as an atheistic or anti-theistic statement. It very much has to do with religious belief or lack thereof. 

You also can't control other people's offense. You can find it ridiculous, sure, but your friend can express his position and feelings. If you both had a reasonably polite discussion about it, no one has done anything wrong. ",Human

You're the asshole for rooming with someone who you know does drugs and expecting them to change for you. He probably won't. He likely can't without medical or mental health assistance. Coke is a highly addictive substance. You're a smart guy, you're in law school, I think you should have known better.

59e61o,"&gt;Nobody uses coke ""once or twice a week"" it was naive of you to believe that.

For people who don't know much about drugs it would be perfectly reasonable to believe somebody who said that. I don't think Op is an asshole for taking this guy's words at face value and then being annoyed that he was essentially lied to - with an ""I promise"" on top of it too.

I do think Op could be making his concerns known in the wrong way though - getting into fights as opposed to a productive discussion. They also say ""I guess it doesn't really affect me that much, if at all"" but that is contradicted by their actions: getting pissed off and arguing about it, being annoyed by the guy being high and implying that it's adding to an already stressful situation.",Human
59e61o,"I think the amount still does make a difference - if he's using a lot then he has to be getting it from somewhere in a fairly steady supply and might even be dealing to others. That would be more likely to get him on somebody's radar.

It's also harder for op to plausibly deny knowing about it.",Human
59e61o,Agreeing to him doing it once or twice and week and him doing it every single day are 2 different things.,Human
59e61o,I thought all lawyers were assholes?,Human
59e61o,"However, I feel that that was incredibly naive on OP's part. Already having established a pattern of regular drug use (as compared to occasional drug use), I feel that ""I like to do coke 1-2 x weekly,"" should have been a clue that ""OP, I like to do drugs regularly."" It's not hard to guess that this will likely lead to *increased* regular use, and now we're here.  
  
  All in all, OP is naive, not asshole, and roommate is struggling with substance abuse, not intentionally an asshole either. Offer him some resources for help if you're able to, but otherwise, look for a new living situation ASAP before he gets to the point where he's pawning/stealing to maintain his (expensive) habit.",Human
59e61o,"&gt;I do think Op could be making his concerns known in the wrong way though


I completely agree with this part. This is a medical/mental health issue, you don't yell at people over those kinds of issues, if you ask me. You call their parents or emergency services or the dean of students at the university. This is a problem that's over OP's pay grade and it's not his place to yell at the guy when he's obviously got issues.

It's foolish to ever take a drug addict at his word. People who use drugs are very good at lying so I do understand why OP wanted to believe this guy. However, I believe that someone who is in *law school* should have known better, whether they had any experience with addicts in the past or not. If you're on track to be a lawyer you don't mess with illegal stuff and you don't mess with people who do. ",Human
59e61o,"Coke is coke man, and an addictive one, you're naive to think its a couple times a week thing. That's like moving in with someone you know who's addicted to porn then being mad they jerk off every day.",Human

59e7me,"Need more detail about what exactly you said, but as far as I can tell it doesn't make you an asshole to call a spade a spade. 

You don't need to be a vet to look at a dead cat and say ""yeah that ain't alive""",Human
59e7me,I do know that I was just telling them what they were saying was bullshit and ignorant. But that's all I remember. My thing is more is it OK to stand up for a culture that isn't my own. Do I have the right?,Human
59e7me,"Yeah not the asshole. You were literally just doing what we do here and saying ""Yo that wasn't cool"". You could not be gay and it would still be fine to tell someone else ""Hey, you probably shouldn't say faggot, its not nice""",Human
59e7me,I think his thought process was that we speaking up made it seem like his culture didn't have a voice and needed my help. I hope that makes sense ,Human
59e7me,"Yeah I get that but still, that's excessive and bitchy for him to take it there for this type of small scale thing. It's not like you cut him off while he was saying it to someone and acted like you knew more, you just stated a fact to someone.",Human
59e7me,Yeah he's not exactly the best guy in the world. But I just want to make sure I never over step my boundary with any future partners or friends again,Human

59e7me,"When you tell off your ex's friends, on whose behalf are you doing so? Are you telling them off as a favor to your ex, or are you calling them out because you find the comments demeaning to an entire group of people, or some combination of the two? Would you still call these people out if the comments weren't directed at your ex?",Human
59e7me,Oh I never told off his friends. These were just random classmates of mine who were shit talking all Latino people. And I completely went off on them. And then I later told my ex about it and that's when he got pissed,Human
59e7me,"I was in a long term relationship with a Mexican man many years ago and we had quite a few cultural clashes, one of them was similar.  

His friend was belittling and demeaning his girlfriend.  At one point his friend was in the girl's face yelling and cussing at her.  

I moved between the two and called the guy out on his abhorrent behavior they both separated to go different directions.  

I asked my ex why he didn't say anything to his friend about what he was doing and his response was similar that it was none of our business and all I succeeded in was embarrassing myself.  

That created a big fight between us and the first time I was so horrified at our differences that I was considering leaving him.  

I'm older and have grown in so many ways but the only thing I'd  change is to be less of a hot head.  

As far as the racism thing the only thing I'd suggest is that people tend to listen better and respect an opinion from someone that looks like them.  If it were other white women then it might have done something but otherwise you may not have been taken as seriously as you should have been.   

It sucks the world works that way but it does.  ",Human
59e7me,"In that case, not an asshole. If you do something like this in the future, I'd just avoid telling him. Telling him gives the impression that you undertook the action as a favor to him, which might come across as a bit patronizing.",Human
59e7me,Thanks this is actually pretty informative to me. I never really thought it may be a cultural difference. And they were white guys. I doubt I did anything but I'll try and believe I did. I hope he and I have both grown in many ways since then,Human
59e7me,I'll keep that in mind for any future relationships or friendships. I totally understand why he took it that way. I guess I just wanted him to be proud of me ,Human
59e7me,"It depends a lot on the context.

You didn't know them and walked up to them- yes, you are an asshole. It had nothing to do with you and it makes you a preachy semi-asshole at best, and an absolute 100% asshole at worst

You knew them, and went off on them getting all offended - Somewhat. Being offended (especially for someone else/someone else's culture) isn't really a good trait. It can be understandable in some circumstances (if they were being extreme, sure) but if it was something like a few jokes or just plain opinions then yeah you're an asshole.

59e7me,"""The ultimate source of this idiom is a phrase in Plutarch's Apophthegmata Laconica:'την σκαφην σκαφην λεγοντας (ten skaphen skaphen legontas).[6] The word σκαφη (skaphe) means ""basin, or trough.""[7] Lucian De Hist. Conscr. (41) has τα συκα συκα, την σκαφην δε σκαφην ονομασων (ta suka suka, ten skaphen de skaphen onomason),[8] ""calling a fig a fig, and a trough a trough"".

Erasmus translated Plutarch's σκαφην (skaphe), as if from σπάθη (spáthe), as ligo ""shovel"" in his Apophthegmatum opus. Ghandi Lakshmi speculates that the introduction of the word ""shovel"" may have been a conscious, dramatic choice rather than a mistranslation.[9]

The phrase was introduced to English in 1542 in Nicolas Udall's translation of Erasmus' work, Apophthegmes, that is to saie, prompte saiynges. First gathered by Erasmus, as follows:[9]

Philippus aunswered, that the Macedonians wer feloes of no fyne witte in their termes but altogether grosse, clubbyshe, and rusticall, as they whiche had not the witte to calle a spade by any other name then a spade.

In the expression, the word spade refers to the instrument used to move earth, a very common tool.[9] The same word was used in England, Denmark, and in the Netherlands,[10] Erasmus' country of origin.[11]""

Edit: Also found this

""The phrase **predates** the use of the word ""spade"" as an ethnic slur against African Americans,[9] which was not recorded until 1928""


Soooo..phrase was around waaaay before..so the ""roots"" aren't racist. Just h",Human

59edy3,"Not the asshole, if it was that important she should have taken better care of it.

59edy3,"I think your title presupposes your innocence.  How thoroughly did you look through what you threw away? Has this happened before?  Do you ever get upset or flustered by her messiness?  Do you, in all honesty, think your apathy for what you were disposing of could have been at least in part due to exasperation with always cleaning up after her?  ",Human
59edy3,"Yeah, this. Not the asshole for throwing away garbage. Kind of an asshole for throwing shit away without looking at it.",Human
59edy3,"This happens with my parents a lot. I'm going to say you're not an asshole for cleaning up, however you should probably have taken more care to look through it. ESPECIALLY since you know your wife does this, you could have been more careful in throwing things out since you're aware she often piles important things with unimportant things.",Human
59edy3,"I don't think so, it wasn't intentional. I would, however, talk to your wife about what you all need to do to keep the house in order. While it certainly sounds like she's not taking care of her things, I don't know from the info provided how often you've asked her to clean up or what your arrangement is as to who needs to pick up after the kids. 

You could also buy some folders or paper trays so that if you do have to clear the table off, you can put her things somewhere for her to deal with without having to sort through it and decide what to throw out. In the future I'd at least give a heads up that you are throwing away things and ask if she needs to get anything from the table before you do so. ",Human
59edy3,Yeah but it's not really fair that I literally have to sift through disgusting crap to merely keep the place reasonably clean. FFS she used an old newspaper as a folder and left a half eaten slice of pizza on it and yelled at me when I cleaned that up! Her car is a dumpster too. ,Human
59edy3,"This seems like a lack of compatibility. You both expect a different level of cleanliness, which is neither your fault nor hers. I'd sit down and talk to her about expectations on your end and see where you guys can find some common ground/compromise.

Perhaps designate a day for cleaning that pile. Or get her a mail organizer and work together to change the habits that caused this misunderstanding.",Human
59edy3,"Your title says: ""Am I the asshole for cleaning up garbage?"" No, you're not an asshole for cleaning up garbage, but you **are** an asshole for throwing away important papers without looking at them to see what they are, and for refusing to take responsibility for that.",Human

You're not the asshole for cleaning up or for throwing out actual garbage. Obviously. However, something about this whole thing makes me think you quite possibly did it in a towering exasperated rage and this made you careless.

Quite frankly you're both kind of assholes in this one thing. You currently have incompatible lifestyles but instead of reaching some kind of compromise (eg your wife has a room and a desk for her piles of papers and crap that you don't touch, but the common areas are fair game) you're fighting with each other and asking misleading questions about it on reddit.

You're married adults not two toddlers who share a playroom. I suggest you grow up and sort yourselves out.",Human

59edy3,"Excuse me? I'm an asshole for throwing away 10 pages of random web pages printed on recycled pages (meaning one side is just ads and page footers) mixed with banana peels and junk mail? Yeah, right. I also work full time and I'm the one doing all the housework, cooking, gardening and maintenance, making sure the kids do their homework and all while she comes home expecting supper to be served and then goes back to work or sleep without ever helping in any way, so fuck that. 

",Human
59edy3,You need to talk to her before throwing out her stuff..,Human
59edy3,I think the main issue people are having with your behavior is that you seem to have known there could be important papers mixed in and yet you threw them away regardless.,Human
59edy3,"I had no idea those few sheets of paper were of any importance, given they were mixed with garbage and printed on paper that was meant to go out for recycling in the first place AND mixed with junk mail... next to the (full) recycling box. Even the kids know this is where you put papers destined for the trash.

By her logic, I should rummage through every garbage bag, every piece of garbage to ensure *she* didn't put something ""important"" in there. I told her it was a completely unrealistic expectation and if she wants to continue that way, she'll have to do all the housework because I'm done with this shit.


",Human
59edy3,"What I meant was it seems (maybe I'm misinterpreting the timeline) that you were aware that your wife might mix important things in with trash before you threw it away, and so you chose to ignore the possibility that there were important papers there. If this is incorrect, then it was just an honest mistake and I can't see anything hat you did wrong. 

If, however, it is correct, then you do bear some responsibility, regardless of how unreasonable your wife's behavior is. ",Human
59edy3,"Did you help her sift through the garbage can afterwards to get her things back? If not, then yes, you are the asshole here.",Human
59edy3,"I showed her in which bag the stuff was and she recovered it. I didn't get thanked for cleaning the rest of the house either. If she doesn't want her stuff ending up there, it's up to her not to mix it with garbage in the first place. If she's not happy, she can do the cleaning herself (would be a first...). She does fuckall in the house so I'm pretty much at the end of my rope getting verbally abused for this kind of shit. We both work hard but I get nearly 100% of all the housework/cooking/parenting work on top of it. It's unfair, unbalanced and rude of her to treat me that way, in front of the kids no less.",Human
59edy3,"&gt; you do bear some responsibility, regardless of how unreasonable your wife's behavior is.

Not disputing this because there's pretty always the risk of her leaving some of her papers in the middle of trash but I refuse to be called an asshole in front of our kids because of her own laziness. We're talking about someone who uses her computer's recycle bin for storage.",Human
59edy3,"To be sure, you have every right to be upset with your wife's behavior, especially what you just said. If you were asshole, it seems like it was out of frustration more than anything. 

It doesn't help anyone if we excuse our behavior by the worse behavior of others, but owning up to out own part in a conflict doesn't excuse the other person either. I don't think anyone is suggesting you are the bigger asshole here.",Human
59edy3,"The situation you're in sounds really horrible, unfair, and unworkable, and I'm genuinely sorry for you. I notice in another comment you say your wife calls you names in front of your children. Terrible.

But focusing on whether or not it was okay to throw out her stuff is missing the big picture. It's like if your leg is broken in three places and has gangrene, and you want to argue about whether or not your toenails are clean.

/u/ohnotagainthrowaway, it really sounds to me like your marriage is heading into serious trouble. You're not on the same page, there's no consensus about how you live your lives together, the division of labour is unfair and taking its toll, at least some of your interactions together are inappropriate and marked by lack of mutual respect, and you're filled with simmering anger and resentment at the person you're in a relationship with.

I get why you would want to feel validated on this one issue, and I understand why you're angry I didn't help provide that, but seriously, that's not what's important here.

You need to have a serious think and decide if your marriage is worth saving and if so, talk with your wife and proactively make a plan to address these issues. Otherwise you'll probably be ranting about banana peels etc etc in a divorce court soon enough.",Human
59edy3,"Yeah, that's fair enough. My wife and I had a similar situation a few weeks back where some important letters got trashed and we were out by the bins together picking through rotting garbage.

You're really frustrated though, and it shows. Believe me, I know that mess itself is stressful, even before you start throwing things like resentment in there. You need to find a solution that you can live with long-term (hopefully for the rest of your life!), be it hiring a cleaner or building your wife a shed/cupboard/box where she can store her mess, because being angry about the situation won't do anything except maybe make everyone more angry or upset.",Human
59edy3,"If what you are describing is accurate, this is a mental illness, time to start finding medical help for your wife, this is serious fucked up time.",Human
59edy3,"Holy shit there are a lot of people in here who don't seem to understand that your children are growing up surrounded by little piles of garbage and their mom gets angry when anyone tries to clean it. If this isn't mental illness, it's deeply self-centered behaviour and is not appropriate for a parent. Regardless, you and your children have every right to live free from her messiness.

My sister in law and brother in law both do a vaguely similar version of this with the same results and I can see when it creates anxiety in my niece. Life is already stressful enough with and for kids. You have clearly tried to communicate this with her at a more appropriate moment, but she won't have. Sifting through her junk is not a reasonable prerequisite to taking out the trash ",Human
59jmqk,"In short, no. 

If you're going through a stressful time and you think it will help you then go for it. Yes, he might not like dyed hair too much and even thinks it looks trashy, but he seems like he still very much supports your decision to do it regardless.

You're only young once, I say go for it! It's just hair, you can always change it.
",Human
59jmqk,"&gt;It's just hair

Yeah that's my mentality about it too. Worst case scenario I go all over platinum again or just strip the color and redye it brown. Idk it's not a big deal to me but I'm a huge people pleaser and he's been having a rough go of it lately as well so I think I feel a little selfish for it. I think I'm gonna go for it. :)",Human
59jmqk,"You're not the asshole. You can be in any sort of committed relationship and absolutely at no point should your partner be able to tell you what you can and cannot do. He can express his opinion, but you, as an adult woman with autonomy/control of your body, have the final say. 

He doesn't have to like your hair color to still love you. If he can't deal with it, it shows you now some glaring problems that likely would have come up later in the relationship. But overall, it's just hair that'll grow out and get re-dyed in no time anyway. 
",Human
59jmqk,"Yeah I know he's not gonna like break up with me or throw a hissy fit Idk I guess I'm a people pleaser, it's an issue I'm working on (therapy yeah!) but I still struggle with feeling like I'm letting people down if they disapprove of my decision.",Human
59jmqk,"Absolutely not. You're not an asshole for doing what you want to your body. HE'S the asshole for making such a big deal out of it. If he's your boyfriend then the color of your hair shouldn't affect his feelings for you, I understand having personal taste and being open and honest about what you do and don't like, but to make an ""issue"" out of it? fuck that.",Human
59jmqk,"It doesn't sound like he's making an issue of it to me, just that he is sharing his preferences, which is what adults do in adult relationships.  He would be making a big deal out of it if he told her he would break up with her or there would be some other consequence if she dyed her hair.  I say no assholes here.

Oh, and OP: dye it!!  Do it!!!!!!  Go crazy!  Now is definitely the time, before you end up in a job where you prefer something more toned down!  ",Human
59jmqk,Neither of you are assholes but consider getting different gifts for yourself. I personally would not date a girl with a non natural hair color. You are 21 and are probably about to start your career and crazy hair comes with social stigma. You can do what you want with your hair but it is going to effect the way people treat you.,Human
59jmqk,"That's why I'm doing it now. The dye is semi permanent, so it only lasts a few months, long before I'll be starting a job. ",Human
59jmqk,"Catering to your partner's preferences, which can take many many forms, is one of the basic ways to show them how much you care.  There are probably tons of other things you do differently because of him, maybe the shows you watch, other grooming/fashion choices, or whatever.  Probably lots of little things you're happy to do, maybe even some harder to swallow compromises.

In a good relationship that has lots of that on both sides, it's not unreasonable at all to decide to not cater in one facet at your whim - especially something as relatively insignificant and temporary as hair.  

That said, since it would bum him out a little bit but otherwise he's being cool about it, maybe there's something else you could ""trade""?  A concession you don't normally make but know he would love would definitely make it easier to keep a good attitude.",Human
59jmqk,"If he will literally stop loving you or something like that, consider how much he really does care about you. Yes, I would be upset if my boyfriend shaved his hair off, but I would never say he looks ridiculous or feel any differently about him. Same concept with your hair.",Human
59jmqk,"No assholes here. You don't have to feel bad for sometimes prioritizing your feelings over your partners. Sounds like you guys had a reasonable discussion about it and if you really want to proceed you shouldnt feel any guilt. 

Personal advice, i have at different intervals dyed my hair blue,green, and shaved it off entirely. I didn't find any to be the transformative experience i thought it would be. I don't regret any of them but they were a tad disappointing. ",Human
59jmqk,"No, you're fine, it's your choice.  You could give him a heads-up about the colors you're considering if you are concerned about his response, but you shouldn't feel obligated to do so. Much better than a face tattoo.",Human
59jmqk,"Asshole for changing your hair no asshole for saying ""He's loving, caring blah blah blah"" yes.",Human
59jmqk,"As a guy who also hates fake colors - yeah I'd be kinda pissed.

If your boyfriend randomly shaved his head or did something to make him less attractive in your eyes would you care?",Human
59jmqk,"Thanks, I have an appointment set for tomorrow and my boyfriend is coming with me to keep me company :)",Human
59jmqk,"Nah, just do it.",Human
59jmqk,She's not doing it randomly if she told him about it ahead of time.,Human
59jmqk,"From the perspective of someone older who has been married for a few years, you're not the asshole. Neither is he, since you said he was just expressing a preference but also said it wouldn't change anything. As others have said, it's about communication and give and take. No one is 100% compatible in a relationship so it's about finding someone whose flaws you can live with.

My one concern is your habit of spending under stress. A cat isn't a cheap proposition when you include vet bills and you're a student. I can promise you that work deadlines, layoffs, illness, and so on will hit more often than twice a year. Will you spend money when lack of money is the stressor? A ""stress fund"" line item in your budget that you stick to when you need that pick-me-up will help.

Anyway, enjoy the fun hair! I miss having wacky colors!",Human
59jmqk,"Well he's not going to stop loving ber, but if she asks his opinion when he clearly stated it and she does it anyway, it's kind of a big slap in the face.

I want to grow a beard but my girlfriend doesn't like them, so I'm not going to grow a beard. Is her hair really that important to her to piss off her partner?",Human
59jmqk,"Not an asshole, but you definitely need to learn how to cope with stress.",Human
59jmqk,"I mean yeah you kind of are. You willingly made yourself unattractive to your partner for no reason other than 'you felt like it.' You and your partner should work to be more attractive for each other... not less. Yes, ultimately it's your decision, but you sound like a selfish partner. You wanted to do something, and you know he would no longer find you attractive if you do. But you simply wanted to? Literally just liking a color is more important than your partner's happiness and satisfaction? That's weird. You say he's loving and caring... are you? Doesn't sound like it if you're so concerned about just doing what you want when it will upset him and hurt your relationship.

You're young and it sounds like you have some growing up to do... you need a better way to deal with stress. You're getting to be too old to buy pets and change your hair whenever you feel sad.",Human
59jmqk,its your body your hair fuck him,Human
59jmqk,"I'll answer this like it was my girlfriend getting a dye job that I don't like.

It's her decision, and her hair. She can do what she likes with it.

But, it definitely shows that she holds her hair color in more regard than my preferences. I'd definitely keep that in mind. Granted, it's not going to be very significant on its own. If she kept doing things that were blatantly against my preferences, it shows a lack of care and consideration and that'd definitely be something to talk about.

If she came home with 50 piercings on her face or the equivalent, I'd leave her. There's no point in being with someone who has that big of a lack of consideration for you and your attraction to them.

You're not an asshole, but a tiny bit inconsiderate. ",Human
59md15,"The ""assholes"" bit, yeah kinda. Unnecessary. However I don't think you're unjustified.",Human
59md15,"Yes. You could have said ""excuse me"" or pointed out more politely that they were making it difficult for people to get through. If they'd refused to move then maybe your escalation would have been justified.

I think being annoyed by those people is normal and not assholey though.",Human
59md15,"Yeah, I hate to say it but you are. Sure it's really annoying when people do that but with 20 people not everybody in that situation was the cause of it. 

Some were probably just part of the logjam, exactly like you, so shoving them and calling them assholes is not ideal, especially since you wouldn't have been able to tell when you started your action whether there were old people or small children in there who could have been hurt. 

A general rule of thumb is to tell people what you want and at least give them a chance to do it before you break out the insults and sarcasm. 

I would have gone with ""excuse me, everybody please move back or stand aside"". Which is actually the driver's job, but hey.",Human
59md15,Learn to say excuse me,Human
59md15,"&gt; ""Excuse me, but you guys are crammed up here blocking people from entering. Do you realize how rude this is? Please be more considerate and move back.""

Honestly, this would have been better than barreling through a group of people calling them assholes, but this still sounds incredibly abrasive and brash. Telling the fellow bus riders that they're rude and lacking in consideration is unnecessarily provocative when other types of gestures would have sufficed.",Human
59md15,Maybe you're projecting. ,Human
59md15,"""Can everyone move down please?""  

I get on packed commuter trains in London every day. No need to be abrasive, just ask the question. If people don't move without providing explanation, then I think you're entitled to a stronger action.",Human
59md15,"Yeah kinda dude. You could have just went with the ""scuse me, pardon me"" you could have even thrown in a snarky ""people still trying to get on the bus here""

But yeah you did kinda blow it out of proportion",Human
59md15,"Maybe, but not all assholes are wrong assholes.",Human
59md15,"Very much an asshole. Next time be polite. ""Excuse me"" and then start to wake you way through the crowd ""excuse me, pardon me"" until you are on the other side of the group. 

If you were standing on the bus and some person got on and just shoved his was through and called you an asshole, what would you think about them?",Human
59md15,"Yeah, you started at a 8 or 9 when a simple excuse me woukd have probably worked.  You response seems like you were having a shitty day. ",Human
59md15,"People are dumbass lemmings. They stand in clusters on busses and are dumbfounded when others need to get through. They shirk the burden of needing to move out of your way.
Realize this and treat them nice anyways. You were not an asshole until your last word. I think more people need to call out groups in sarcastic ways like you did. But you got a bit aggressive there for not getting your way. Stop being a whiny lil bitch. Instead say exactly what you did, minus the word assholes, and say it in a funny cool way. Then it's fine. But because you were probably being mean and swore yep ur a dick. Asshole. ",Human

Do not let anyone have your password. Maybe if they live in your house/are your spouse, but it should stay private.

Dont put is past them to wait for you outside or when your friend is not around. It sounds overly dramatic, but all those ingredients are ripe for the situation to escalate. Honestly, if she aint my girlfriend or wife, im not fighting. Not worth ot. I would not have gone and confronted they guy.",Human
59uwfg,"I almost feel guilty for confronting him, I can understand that maybe he is really desperately in love eith her or something, but still that doesn't justify him doing that.

But you're right, I guess it would've been better to just let it go. The problem is that this guy was actually a really nice dude prior, or so i thought. We weren't close friends or anything but we got along. We live together at the dorms so it's going to be interesting seeing him around the whole time. I sure hope he doesn't escalate, but I doubt it. He wouldn't be able to do anything on his own but hopefully he won't bring his friend into this like he did that night.

I don't think she's an asshole necessarily for having patriarchal values from her culture, but I think getting mad at your lack of confirming to those values is assholish on her part. Certainly, giving you the silent treatment for it was petty.

I do think that (as the title put it) demanding an apology for this is an overreaction. Both of you seem pretty entrenched and not willing to listen to the concerns of the other, which means that issues of this kind will continue to be a problem.

You raise a good point here. Once she cools down, it might be worthwhile to have a discussion with her about it. Hopefully you wouldn't insult her for not upholding gender roles, so it's a double standard for her to do the same to you. She may have a bit of a Have-Your-Cake-And-Eat-It-Too syndrome.

In any case, you should talk these things through and in the next time you have that kind of a decision to make, you should be 100% sure that your bf agrees with it. 

Generally speaking though, no I don't think it should be a big deal anyway that you stayed there to save money and he should have understood that.",Human

Yes. Yes you are.",Human
5a0uqq,"I don't know much about you, your boyfriend or this gig but based on the info provided here's what I got:

So you choose to spend the night with a female friend 
She lives with someone you fucked in the past 
Your boyfriend doesn't like this 
The way it's presented put him off

If the money is significant then you are in the clear. It'll come down to trust and frustrations regarding poor planning. I would still apologize for the circumstances. 

If the money is not significant then that was a dick move as you are using something insignificant to justify an action that caused him duress. You're an asshole. 

Finally,  relationships are based on empathy and comprise.  Are you able to empathize with his feelings?  What do you gain and lose from having his perspective?  You can answer this better than anyone here.

If this is a long-term boyfriend and they don't trust each other enough to spend 1 night in the vicinity of an ex... then i'd bet it's the start of a whole mess of other problems.

Except when you're in a fucking relationship you're not really supposed to say ""lol fuck off deal with your own shit"". It's attitudes like that which lead to people being single.

Every right in the world. How the fuck do you think its acceptable to neglect your partner's feelings and do whatever you want and say its his problem?

I understand what you're saying and I feel like you're making a bit of a straw man out of what I said.  I would never advocate""fuck off"" as an appropriate response to anything, what I suggested was that his feelings aren't ample reason to control her behavior.  If he can't trust her judgement the problem lies in his emotional immaturity and not her imaginary infidelity.  I've been cheated on before; it sucks, but I didn't double down on fear that it could happen again. I learned not to put all my trust on the table right away, to take my time to get to know the people I'm with so I know best how to enhance their life rather than worrying about what they bring to mine.",Human
5a0uqq,"&gt;if he can't trust her judgement

Yeah I think I'd distrust the judgement of someone who did something I explicitly told them made me uncomfortable.

&gt;his feelings aren't ample reason to control her behavior

You talk in the sense of control like asking your partner not to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable is so goddamn awful. It's not control, he expressed discomfort at something that would make most people uncomfortable.

My girlfriend told me a few months ago she was uncomfortable with me talking to a certain girl because she felt she was into me, and you know what I did? Even though I didn't see it I respected her feelings and trusted her judgement and stopped talking to her. Because I respect my partner enough to care more about her feelings than acting like a free spirit who cares more about themselves than their partner.

You keep talking like this is a trust issue. I trust my girlfriend, but if she's putting herself in positions like these, that's disrespectful. It's a respect issue. OP has absolutely no respect for her partner. 

If I tell my girlfriend I'm uncomfortable with something reasonable, and she does it, that's disrespectful. Same with vice versa.

You say that your mother made many mistakes and was much harder on her than the rest of you while she was growing up, but you never explain how or to what extent. It is entirely possible that you sister considers your mother an abuser, or at least a toxic presence in her life, and resents her other siblings for having been treated much better than she was. You've said nothing about how she was treated by your grandparents and she could feel the same way towards them. These feelings are valid and understandable.

And now, she is in the hospital, suffering from stomach ulcers which I can assure you do cause an incredible amount of pain, and because she's been rude to your mother and grandparents in the past you really feel nothing? You expect her to forgive and forget with your mother but don't feel any emotions towards her now that she is in a time of serious need? Why do you expect her, during a time of great pain, to show a level of magnanimity that you aren't even trying to approach?

So yes, you are being an asshole. You aren't showing your sister the basic level of concern that one human being should show to another, much less one they are siblings with.

Its not just rude, its outright cruel how she treats my mother for just attempts at fixing the relationship. Im not defending my mother by doing it.

(Just to explain)",Human
5acgc9,I didnt. I just listened to what my mom said and feel terrible that i dont have the emotions i feel i should.,Human
5acgc9,"My nephew is in hospital since a few weeks. It crossed my mind he might die from his disease, but I didn't feel any negative emotions. I've never been close with my nephews, they were always socially awkward towards girls. 
I do feel sorry for my aunt if this were to happen but honestly I couldn't care less. 
You can't control what you feel, just consider others feelings if you speak of it. 
",Human
5acgc9,"I think with as much as I can know based on what you've shared, you're not an asshole for not feeling bad.  I'm sure you feel bad to know that she is hurting, but it doesn't feel the same as if it was someone you truly cared about or even knew as a person.  

It's nice advice to always be kind and help those in need, but it's more of a ""first time shame on you, second time shame on me"" kind of thing when helping people who don't appreciate it.  I have a sister who is depressed and into bad drugs, and the first 3 fucking times I heard that she got arrested or went into rehab I was hopeful and optimistic each fucking time.  Now that she's been arrested over 10 times and in rehab just as many, I have emotionally checked out.  I don't want to hear about it when she dies of an overdose, I don't want to hear about it when she gets arrested, or has another baby (she's given birth to 9 kids that she has no legal custody of) or any of that shit, and I've given up hope on it actually meaning anything when I hear ""she's doing good"".

Anyway, just be a good person, and be good to those around you, and try to make a difference where you can, but also be wise enough to realize when you're wasting your time. ",Human
5acgc9,I try. I feel terrible because everyone else is concerned and im worried about my grandparents more.,Human
5acgc9,"&gt;We know it wasnt abuse from my mother. The only abuse i know of is her father who hasn't been around in a long time.

I am curious how you know this. Also, many abused people rightfully blame the parent who stood by and let the abuse happen just as much as the abuser himself. This is compounded by your mother's own harsh treatment of her, as well as being able to see the difference between how she was treated and how the other siblings were treated.

What you call ""cruelty"" may be in her eyes justified payback for what she considers abuse or complicity in abuse.",Human
5acgc9,"We know this from the other people who witnessed the change in the man when he came home from the war at the time. Yes this is a proven fact. 

It is cruelty since she treats my grandparents, who have done nothing but support her with all of her problems financially and emotionally, with disrespect for years.",Human
5acgc9,"No. Familial obligations can be as bad as a disease, sometimes. ",Human
5acifc,Absolutely not and it sounds like everyone involved needs to have a serious talk about boundaries. ,Human
5acifc,"Sorry, you have your own place, and your mom tells people they can live there? What? ",Human
5acifc,I'm thinking OP lives with his mom.,Human
5acifc,Yes I live with my mom and am working and going to university.,Human
5acifc,"You aren't the asshole at all. Give him one last month to find a new place and tell your mother respectfully to mind her own business. Be strong, they're trampeling all over your boundries without asking you for your opinion. Your ex living in your house is a big, big deal, it's not like he borrowed a pencil and never returned it. 

 You were helping him out in the beginning, but now he's just taking advantage of you. I can't imagine why a normal sane ex boyfriend would even want to stay at his ex's place. Get his ass out of there after the last month. Sooner if possible. After the time you've given him it is not your responsibility anymore. It wasn't your responsibility to begin with.",Human
5acifc,Do you think she is being the asshole?,Human
5acifc,I think looking at your child and their ex boyfriend as both guests is pretty ridiculous. ,Human
5acifc,You have a point. I should be more sympathetic to her feelings. This also teaches me when it is time to put her in a home I do not need to make her comfortable.,Human
5acifc,"True, but just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should. I would be well within my right to leave home and never talk to her again. An option that seems more enticing by the day. ",Human

5acifc,"If anyone is the asshole here, it's your ex.

I would talk to the mum about you wanting to feel safe at home (home to me is a friggin sanctuary, no one is allowed to make me feel uncomfortable in my own home), and also explain to her that he has other people he can ask. your mom doesn't need to do this for him at all.

At least I would be safe and free to live my life without someone who is actively seeking to hold me back.",Human

5acifc,Did I even need to read this? Go to /r/GetOffMyChest. I think you an asshole for posting this here.,Human
5acifc,Get a restraining order and if it goes through he can't legally move in,Human
5acifc,Everyone is acting like I'm the asshole. I kinda figured this was the place to come to see if they are right.,Human
5acifc,I will look into this. I was under the impression physical violence was required for that.,Human
5acifc,"Mom is an arse, but she can do what she wants",Human
5acifc,"OP never expressed concern over his safety. I think you're conflating safety with comfort. OP is an adult living at home. His mom isn't really obligated to make her home ""comfortable"" to him. He can always move out if he feels uncomfortable at home.",Human
5acifc,"Yea, you should also show her your comment about putting her into a home without any concern for her comfort. I'm sure she'll love that.",Human
5acifc,i believe if you feel threatened in ANY way or he starts causing actual physical/financial (property) problems or prove stalking,Human
5acifc,"The entire problem with your argument is when you say ""My mom feels sorry for him and wants to bring him back to my house"". From what I understand in this thread, it's not ""your"" house. It's your mom's house. You are an adult living there because she lets you. It's her right to do with her house as she wishes; you are not entitled to stay there. 

That being said, if your mom cares about you, she should be considerate to your wishes if you really don't want the guy there. But, if she doesn't care that you don't want him there, you should move. If your sole purpose for still living there is that you don't want to fully support yourself while going to college, then you're being a mooch in the same way that the boyfriend you don't want anymore is. 

After reading your other comments about putting your mom in a nursing home, though, I think you're an entitled little brat. It sounds like your mom's a bleeding heart and you're just an entitled asshole.",Human
5acifc,"Uh, no; that means the mom can throw her out before moving him in. And that's exactly what I would do before allowing someone else to control who I let live in my house.",Human
5acifc,"Well absolutely. If it is my money, and I shouldn't prioritize my happiness over the happiness of my family (or the people I care about). It would be an asshole thing to do to stick her in a really terrible nursing home. That is kinda the point I was making. Being within ones right and being an asshole are not mutually exclusive.",Human
5acifc,"Well yeah. It is kinda the point I am making. This is a thing I am well within my right to do. SHOULD I do it? no. Can I do it? Absolutely, I would love to fill a room with the money I would save by doing so and swim in it like scrooge mcduck.",Human
5acifc,"Yeah, no. Sticking your elderly mother in a shitty nursing home to save money at the sacrifice of her comfort really isn't comparable, particularly if you're using money from her estate to pay for the accommodations. As a (presumably) mentally competent adult, you can move out of your mom's place of your own volition.",Human
5acifc,"Sure, but the thing about this is, you gave away your attitude when you made the statement ""my house"". And that attitude is what makes you the primary asshole here. (Well, that and the restraining order thing and the nursing home thing...) Had you said ""our house"" or ""my mom's house"", I would probably think a little different. Your ex hasn't been a part of your life against your will; you just haven't been willing to do anything about it. If you really didn't want him around you, you'd move. 

And if you go file a restraining order against someone that you're not actually afraid of (and at this point, I don't believe you are), you're most definitely the asshole. A restraining order is permanently damaging; it will be on his record until the day he dies. 

Don't invite the damn cops into this guy's life just because you don't want to be inconvenienced by his presence. Inviting the cops into someone's life and giving them a permanent record over petty bullshit like this shows a severe lack of character on your part.  He will be labeled as dangerous and abusive by the law forever. Not only that, but if you go to the same school at the same times, it will affect his ability to go to college, maybe causing him to not be able to go at all until you're finished. And the student loan debt accumulated, if any, is something that won't go away, either and will affect his financial abilities far into the future. Once he defaults on student loans, if he has any, he can't even go back to s",Human
5acifc,"Fine I accept your point of view. I don't think you are right, I think you are digging more than a little and making a few assumptions. But I also don't feel the need to justify my actions, jokes, or the options I consider to you. I got what I wanted, you think I'm the asshole. Cool thanks. ",Human
5acifc,Considering I didn't live with her for three years before she convinced me to move back in and finish college. (Moving across the country away from every safety net I had) I would probably never speak to her again if it came down to that. I don't care how much of her say it is choosing my ex over me means I can not trust her and should not allow her into my life. You are right that I would move if he moves in. I would have to drop out of college and go without a few things but at the end of the day I would be better off on the streets where that creep can not get to me.,Human
5acifc,"Not too many blind assumptions to be made here, really. Your intentions for posting this thread have been made pretty clear and your controlling nature is pretty clear, as well. It's not wrong to dig when you see something sticking out of the grass.

If you're considering doing permanent legal damage to someone just because you find their presence inconvenient and doing it to try and control your mother's options on who she lets live in her own house, you have boundary issues. That's not a point of view, that's a psychological fact. If you're not sure, go see a mental health counselor over the issue.",Human
5acifc,"Does it? Ask your girl friends how many exes they have that are gay. The number will be higher than zero. It's obviously not the case this time, but if the BF came out during or post breakup the timeline still holds up to scrutiny.",Human
5afndb,"Well the thing was I couldn't return it that night, unless I wanted to get a DUI.  I'm not trying the shift the blame, I fucked up by taking the vest, but he fucked up by thinking it wasn't a big deal to wait and tell me at the last possible minute.  I wanted to help him, but I don't see a way that would have worked out.  

As for the replacement cost it was 5 bucks, I don't even care about it really.  It's just annoying.  The way I see it it's my fault for taking the badge, but it's his fault for not being able to work with my to solve the problem.",Human
5afndb,I didn't realize I had his vest until he texted me.  Sorry if I didn't make that clear.  I had no clue whatsoever.  If I had known I would have gotten it to him immediately.,Human
5afndb,How do you know he waited to contact you about the error?  Could he not have realized it until late that night?,Human
5afndb,"Because he had to clock back in from his break.  He would have noticed right away when he couldn't find his vest, and he would have clocked in as me.  There is a tv screen above the department desk that displays who's clocked in.  And my vest is 2 or 3 sizes larger than his.  Essentially there is no way he would not of known.

On top of all that he acknowledged that he knew right away, he just didn't do anything.",Human
5afndb,"I'm not seeing how you're the asshole here.  Taking his vest was an accident and he waited about five and a half hours to tell you about it when he obviously knew earlier.  It seems like he could have come to you to get it since you were drunk, but he didn't want to do that.  Paying for the badge seems reasonable enough.  I'm not sure what else he wanted you to do?",Human
5afndb,"Yes you are the asshole, you dropped the ball, you pick it up.  He maynot havetexted you because he thought you were coming back to the apartment, and only realized belatedly that you weren't.  He did nothing wrong in this situation, and you did everything wrong.  ",Human
5afndb,"Looking like you're the asshole, but bruh could probably clock in without his badge, or get his time corrected later, not the end of the world as long as he can get access to the building and do his job.

You could try harder to apologize for the mistake, and you both could try harder to communicate better.",Human
5afndb,He knew I wasn't going to be at the appartment. ,Human
5afndb,"Yeah, well the onus of responsibility is still on you. ",Human
5afndb,"I don't think you're the asshole for reasons you stated above. Also that ""or are you going to be drunk the rest of today too?"" comment is gross. ",Human
5afndb,"Yes but is it not his responsibility to communicate that he needs me to do something?  If I don't know I have his badge, how would I know that something was wrong?",Human
5afndb,"But you took HIS vest. He didn't plan on texting or calling you after or during his break. He texted you when it was convenient and then it was on you to make it right. You could have driven back to the apartment in the morning. You said it was your birthday, and if you wanted to get him the vest/badge, anyone who had plans to take you out to breakfast should be accommodating. It's YOUR birthday. I believe that on birthdays you get to pretty much have everything your way and do anything you want, so if your parents put up a fuss about delaying your plans on your birthday, they're the unreasonable ones.  ",Human
5afndb,You're the asshole because you do things that inconvenience people and then expect them to do everything possible to make it most convenient for **you** to fix the situation.,Human
5afndb,Yea kind of. Mistakes happen. Even though you didn't take it on purpose it's still on you that you have it. You should have done whatever you could have to get it back to him. Like waking up early the next morning to bring it back.,Human
5afndb,"I wasn't using my birthday as a moral high ground, I really couldn't care less about that.

It's more that he waits to tell me (by the way, there's no way it's an inconvenience for him to whip out his phone and text me, it's a really laid back environment.  He was more than happy to do it to bitch at me the next day), then berates me because I was drinking(god forbid), and refuses to compromise.  I was actually going to drive and give him his badge, but then he sent me that messaged and really just turned me off from helping him.  If you're going to wait until the last possible second to tell me something, and expect me to drop anything and everything to get you something I had no idea I had, don't be a prick.",Human
5afndb,"I keep seeing where people are making the comment ""oh you made the mistake first EVERYTHING could have been avoided if you didn't make a mistake"". Well mistakes happen. Assuming his roommate notices at 530 or anytime before 11 and knows OP isn't comimg home- yeah the roommate is a little to blame. It's his badge it's still his responsibility. Both assholes though. The problem could have easily been solved at multiple points throughout the whole situation. It's just one of those situations. You did apologize and are offering to pay for the badge. Your roommate did make a shit tier comment at you. ",Human
5afndb,"He did.  And you made it all his fault, because it wasn't soon enough for you.  your assumption seems to be that he knew at 5:30, which you have no evidence of, and that he waited until late to inconvenience you.  Nowhere in this thread have I seen you act the adult, and say, ""It was my bad, my mistake, my issue to resolve once I became aware of it."" 
The more you argue it, the bigger an asshole you seem to be. Your roommate was legitimately upset, because of your actions.  Which weren't accidental, they were the result of YOU not paying attention to what YOU were doing when you left your apartment, and you muted his texts like a child, and went to bed self satisfied.    
  
Your response should have been, ""My bad, dude, I fucked up, I am setting my alarm for 5am, so I can hustle your property back to you.""  Or, ""catching a cab your way now, sorry man, no worries"".   
  
But you didn't do that, you acted like a child and then came here hoping we would back you up, and when we noted that you behaved as the asshole, you argued it.  
",Human
5afndb,"I agree that I should have gone and drove back early to give him his badge, I only didn't do that because of him being an asshole.  So that is my bad.

However please explain to me how me accidentally grabbing a identical vest from a place where I usually set mine down is not accidental.  And what do you mean by 

&gt; YOU not paying attention to what YOU were doing when you left your apartment

I leave my work vest in the car, it's just a shitty 3 button down vest thing that we're issued.",Human
5afndb,"Yes. You made the mistake and it is on you to fix it. Then, when you didn't hear what you wanted to muted his texts. You really messed uo and owe him an apology.",Human
5afndb,"I muted him when he just out of the blue starts throwing insults, he didn't say anything after those messages, so I didn't miss anything by muting him.

I apologized from the start and I payed for his new badge.  He just made it very hard for the current badge to reach him before his shift.",Human
5afndb,I understand that he was not helping the situation and by paying for the badge and apologizing you made things right. But I would be pissed too.,Human
4m2vs0,"I wouldn't consider you the asshole. 

If he respected your relationship he should have cut contact with her. ",Human
4m2vs0,"Assholes all around. He may be doing something wrong with this girl, but you're still an asshole for snooping through his stuff.",Human
4m2vs0,The snooper is always the asshole.  Whether they find something that makes the snoopee also an asshole us irrelevant.,Human
4m2vs0,"But then on the other hand you can argue that if she respected the relationship she wouldn't have met with the other guy in the first place, regardless of whether they did anything or not.",Human
4m2vs0,"You only feel like the snooping was justified because you found something. He's an asshole for sure, but you're one as well for snooping in the first place. 

Next time you get this feeling, talk to him about it. Don't accuse him of shit you aren't absolutely certain about. If he doesn't have anything to hide he'll probably show you his phone, but even if he doesn't show you, it's no indication of anything dodgy. 

I'd say you've been together for long enough now that you ought to know when he's lying to you, so talk to him rather than looking through his messages ",Human
4m2vs0,I don't think it matters who is or isn't an asshole. You two should really breakup. You can't have a healthy relationship where trust doesn't exist.,Human
4m2vs0,"&gt;After that I felt that he wasn't being honest

&gt;&gt;read his messages

Even here you're an asshole. And how could you be surprised or upset that he felt that way? I mean come on, it's got to be at least somewhat flattering to hear something like that from your boyfriend. I'm not saying he should get mad or anything, it doesn't seem like he did, but he *should* be a ***bit*** skeptical.

&gt;and there was some sexual messages.

Well if this is true, he's an asshole as well. This however doesn't make you less of an asshole.",Human
4m2vs0,"Come on. You can't be in a relationship thinking every single moment will be all right. I'm not going to say they're a perfect match, but there's no reason to think they can't work this out.",Human
4m2vs0,"Eh. It sounds like a high school relationship, where both parties are decently immature, and may have possibly cheated on each other, (depends on your definition of cheating) and have little trust for each other. Doesn't seem healthy, especially when said person turns to Reddit about this particular matter.",Human
4m2vs0,"This would mean they're at most 18. I doubt an 18 year old would call an ex (especially if they dated when she was 16...) an ""old flame"".",Human
4m2vs0,"I meant that it *sounds* like a high school relationship. Not in the literal sense, but figuratively. It very well could be a high school relationship though. People are so quick to use a turn of phrase too. An 'old flame' could be someone they dated freshman year and got back with senior year, or whatever. I'm just playing devil's advocate though. ",Human
4m2vs0,"And you can also argue that she's an asshole for not trusting her boyfriend (and if she CAN'T trust him, he shouldn't be her boyfriend).",Human
4m2vs0,"I'd agree generally, but if this situation keeps repeating itself, sure doesn't seem like they're in a trusting relationship.",Human
4m2vs0,"I have that same feeling, I definitely feel like an asshole, but not the ONLY asshole.",Human
4m2vs0,Everyone is an asshole. Fuck all of you.,Human
4m2vs0,"The way I see it... You're an asshole, but since you found something, so is he, therefore you're a justified asshole.

Source: have been a justified asshole before. ",Human
4m2vs0,"Not sure that I really get your point, what do you mean would be flattering? And I agree that I'm an asshole, I just didn't feel like the only asshole",Human
4m2vs0,"Let's keep score:

You met with an old flame = 1 asshole point

He's writing to/ sexting with a girl he has a history with = 1 asshole point

You snooped through his shit = 1 asshole point.

So, you're both assholes, but you win for bigger asshole with a score of 2 to 1.",Human
4m2vs0,"Personally, I think it sucks to snoop. But what sucks even more is being put into a situation where you feel the NEED to snoop. YOu are still young and honestly this relationship seems broken. Of course that is based only the snippets you shared. It really is ok to let go and move on. I know it's hard, but better sooner rather than later.

On a side note whenever I read stuff like this I always am reminded that my husband routed all his personal emails to my account because he is too lazy/tired after work to respond. He always hands me his phone to reply to texts too. At least I know I can trust him! (He is a super awesome guy, just not as social as me)",Human
4m2vs0,It seems like he loves you enough to be worried something will happen.,Human

Be open about stuff like this. Make it something you can talk about without the other person getting upset. ",Human
4m2vs0,"People who feel justified in spying and invading their SO's personal space are the worst. Huge assholes. If you have so little trust for him and are so controlling that you need to invade his personal space then you should have broken up with him a long time ago. It's your fault for not having the gumption to actually do the appropriate thing. He sucks. You suck worse.

Nothing you can do now, but please don't take this as justification to play games like you have with your future relationships. The attitude will poison them.",Human
4m2vs0,"Him getting back in touch with his own ""old flame"" AND sexting would surely be two asshole points? I mean, OP did meet up with her old flame but didn't do anything sexual and that's one point. That makes them even ",Human
4m2vs0,"I don't like that mentality. If you love someone enough, you would trust that nothing would happen. Being jealous is very different from being untrusting, and her boyfriend at that moment was being untrusting. ",Human
4m2vs0,"Yeah, obviously there should be trust. But there should be trust as in ""I'm worried something happened, but I will not assume it did"".

Edit: I agree with you.",Human
4m2vs0,Do you really think it's justified just because you found something?  Not trying to argue; just curious.,Human
4m2vs0,"No, no, no.  It doesn't matter if anything sexual happened.  There's a lot that goes into being faithful to a person, and to me, emotional cheating is just as bad, if not worse, than sexually cheating.",Human
4m2vs0,"OP, as you can see by my flair, I too have learned that it's a good thing to hear that you're an asshole, and then admit it.

If you make a follow-up post, you too may get flair like mine!  

I'll sum up what's been mentioned.  It doesn't matter if anything sexual happened with your old flame, it's still emotionally cheating.

If you feel the need to snoop, your relationship is probably already over.  Even if you're a married couple, everyone has a right to privacy.  I don't want my husband to be looking through my phone, and it's not because I have anything to hide.

Also, what does this mean?
&gt;Things are shirty now",Human
4m2vs0,"Honestly, I think if you have legitimate reasons to think someone is cheating, the best is to find proof. I wouldn't risk being betrayed and wasting years of my life because I'm too moral not to invade my SO privacy a little. If they have nothing to hide, no problem, but if they are hiding a potential relationship deal breaker from me, I assume I have the right to find out. Not trying to say this is an ethical way to solve problems, but if a person is giving ALL the signs that they're cheating and yet are leaving me hanging cluelessly about it, I find it plausible to try and find proof. Neither less nor more ethical than hiring a detective to follow them around... ",Human
4m2vs0,"But why do you need proof?  If you're sure they're cheating on you and you have to snoop, your relationship is already over.  Why do you need proof?  Why not just break it off?

Let me reiterate, if you're invading your SO's privacy, something is very wrong, or you need to work on your trust issues.",Human
4m2vs0,"I see your point and I'm not going to argue because I know it's wrong. But realistically we all have this urge to snoop, some find it harder to resist. You can never be sure if someone is cheating if you haven't caught them or have them admit it to you. But sometimes a person is acting strange and/or going out at weird times, I don't know. I'm trying to see this through OPs eyes though, I've only snooped once and it turned out there was nothing, we're still together. But I know why I did it. I can't even defend this because it's not moral or logical, I won't deny. It's not exactly *justifiable*, it's more like understandable. ",Human
4m2vs0,"I agree totally about the emotional cheating part, I was just assuming that she met up with him and literally nothing happened, as in no emotions either, but we never know. It's gotta spark up some kinda suspicion as they have history.",Human
4m2vs0,"Haha, that last bit was an auto-correct, supposed to say shitty.",Human
4m2vs0,That's a really weird auto-correct! ,Human
4m2vs0,"A good life lesson here... If you go looking for something be prepared to find it. 

Were you a jerk for looking? Maybe. But he's definitely out of line given his history. This should be a moot question because you've now caught him stepping out twice. Unless you want a relationship with someone who is going to regularly violate your trust you should be on the way out. And if don't care that he'll do that, well just stay out of his phone because by now you should know what's in there. ",Human
4m4wm4,"You're not the asshole.  He has the time to do his work, but prefers to play games.  Mom's attitude here stinks.  Students have the right to fail.  It is a life lesson.  Please, don't enable cheating.  ""No,"" is a complete sentence.",Human

4mlvos,That's how I feel. Towards the beginning of the conversation she had indicated she would drop it and I thanked her for considering my needs. Then towards the end she's pulling up statistics about hypoallergenic breeds and allergy shots.

4mlvos,"The cat at home is technically her mother's, it's her parents house after all. Not something I would have to live with or accommodate in our potential future living arrangement. I'm not asking her to get rid of anything she already owns, simply asking her to pass on getting a new cat and spend time with the cat that already lives in her new apartment. In my mind that's a good compromise, it meets her temporary needs without compromising our future plans. I'm already medicating and fighting allergy reactions when I spend time over there and I don't think it's completely out of the question to ask her to not make it any worse for me or extend it any longer than it needs to be a problem.",Human
4mlvos,"Family cat or not, if you've been dating for 5 years surely you know she likes cats I presume, and I'm guessing its safe to assume she's aware of the severity of your allergies as well.

So again this gets back to my previous point; it's probably time to cut to the chase and have a serious conversation about **whether she's willing to give up cats entirely to accommodate your allergies**, and not pretend this is about what her friends convinced her of, or whether her cat needs a buddy or anything else.

If she's wanted a new cat for a while now, she clearly isn't too attached to her current pets at all, so ""missing"" her current pets is a bunk argument.

4mlvos,Give her a kid. That usually solves the problem.,Human
4mlvos,"&gt;she knows I'm not a cat person, we have some loose plans to move in together next fall, so any decision made now has to sort of consider that.
As far as actual reasoning goes, this is what she has shared with me; she's worried if she doesnt get a cat now, she won't have the chance to later. She wants the other girls cat to have a friend.

Cat owner here. You're being played. 

From what I'm reading, she would be ""catless"" with you since it's a family cat. She now wants a ""her own"" cat to replace the family cat, which isn't actually consulting you at all.

Her reasoning is insultingly stupid and I can tell you're not a cat person. Her friend's cat IS NOT lonely. It doesn't need a friend. Introducing a new cat into a household with a cat is a very tricky situation and it takes time to even see if it'll work. It often doesn't. 

So not only is she not taking your feelings into consideration, she's not taking the other cat's feelings into consideration. This is a traumatic and disruptive experience for single cats. Go to a shelter. Ask them. Ask many adoptions come back. Ask them about all of the cats they have who are ""single kitty household"" cats. 

This is a truly stupid argument and I hate to sound hyperbolic, but it doesn't bode well for future conflict resolution. Think of this as a bullet dodged - if she thinks that little of you and won't compromise and get a god damned dog, imagine if it's her ""accidentally getting pregnant"" or something else?

What a terrible way to live your life, though. The fact he's willing to go around having ""Claritin exhaustion"" for your benefit is really selfless of him. Allergy medications are terrible. They make you feel like shit. I can't imagine having to take them ""most days"". 

As someone who grew up with severe allergies and had to get injection 3-5x a week, I don't get the whole ""just take a pill for it"" mentality. Treat the symptoms, not the cause? How about like...not be around allergens? Allergic to pollen? Live somewhere that's low on it. Allergic to cats...live with cats?!?",Human
4mlvos,...and creates a few dozen other problems.,Human

Allergies are not the same for everyone, neither are the side-effects of allergy medication. This may be a good solution in your case, but it's entirely possible OP does experience negative side-effects of the medication, or that the medication doesn't solve the allergy 100% in his case.

My older brother is allergic to cats, and takes medicine whenever he visits. I guess I don't know the situation in the US, but it can't be that bad to buy medicine for these kinds of allergies, can it? It shouldn't matter that she has pets at home. He should be allowed to date someone who's had pets and not expect them to have pets in the future.",Human
4mlvos,"I'm also taking a pill every day (3, actually, most days) for my allergies to make it through work because the dust is filthy there. Springtime is also pretty miserable for me, and Georgia's pollen season is legendary. His allergies are much the same, but his outdoor allergies are much more aggressive so the pill is often more for that than the cats. His allergies to them have actually improved since being exposed to it so much. For the record, he brought home his own parking lot kitten, so it's not like he's the victim here.

I don't get drowsy from claritin and allegra, and neither does he. Sorry your experience has been so rough. ",Human
4mlvos,"That's true, but to me it sounds more like the OP is a bit of a control freak and a little selfish, and is using the allergy as an excuse to throw a tantrum about the cat. They've been dating since she was 16, I assume he's around the same age. (I kind of hope so?) It's normal to be selfish at that age, but it's part of maturing into an actual adult to get over it. 

""I'm not a cat person"" is a stupid statement. Cats are assholes, but they're a lot of fun and lots of cats aren't actually so bad. But maybe I'm biased, as a former cat hater turned lover, with a trio of cats who convert people into cat lovers.",Human

4mlvos,"I don't think you're being the asshole. 

But I am thinking of it from my perspective. My longtime girlfriend was absolutely not a dog person when we first met. She had a bad experience as a kid and swore up and down that we would never have a dog in the future. I literally grew up with my dog. We got him when I was about 4 and he was put down when I was 19. He was all I knew. But I also recognized that she had her wishes to not get dogs in the future so I came to terms with the fact that I absolutely loved the dog I had but I would be willing to make the sacrifice to not have a dog in the future in exchange for a lifetime partner (she did eventually come around and now is a bit of a dog lover as long as they're small, go figure).

In the end, I think she's weighing her love of cats over a future with you. I don't think she's necessarily being an asshole either because I understand what it means to truly love animals. 

However, I am having trouble understanding what she means that she might not be able to have a cat in future. I don't know what her life plans are but at 21 years old, this would be the most difficult time in your life to have animals to care for. There's school, there's finding a place together in the future, there's traveling, there's wanting to stay at a friends house for a weekend, there's finding a good job (I'm also 21). Owning an animal is most difficult at this point in your life.

Generally, though, it's ideal in cases like this that both people just accept that maybe their memory is faulty or maybe she did tell you, but you didn't hear or whatever. It may be no one's fault or someone's fault, but certainly there's no way to tell whose fault it is.

I'll take being a asshole though and not make a big deal about it. Thanks ",Human
4myuac,"No one is the asshole here. But the easy way to avoid this is to talk about your communication styles. Communication - open, honest and often - is the most important part to a good relationship. It seems like you even have harbored a little frustration over time because little things like this happen often. So this small issue occurs - seems like it's not a huge deal so maybe you don't say anything - but if it happens every month for a year - eventually things will boil over. 


You should #1 - tell her how this situation makes you feel. Do not blame her - but rather state what happened, and how it made you feel (i.e.: This happened, and I felt like I was making the decision that would make you the happiest, but then you didn't need the ride, so I felt like I was now alone in trying to accommodate you or want to ride with you, etc.). Even though this is a seemingly small issue - you don't want to let build up occur. Break down this small thing and have a short talk about it. 


and #2 - talk about communication. You are both at fault here - communication is a 2-player game. Discuss a better strategy. So if communication always seems to fall apart when you are planning things, perhaps it's best to set up a strategy for planning things like this that you both are aware of and always go by. You can't follow rules or guidelines if you don't know what they are. Maybe you create a Google Calendar that's shared and you actually write how you will get to the event in the description ",Human
4myuac,"It's the twisting part you should be worried about.

You don't want to be with someone that invalidates your feelings.

It'a really no fun to be treated insensitively, but then made to feel whiny or selfish if you try to talk about it. Men are allowed to have feelings too.",Human
4myuac,"No, you're not the asshole. Changing standing plans and not telling other people involved is inconsiderate, at best. If she's just scatterbrained or ditzy like that, it's probably not worth getting too worked up over. ",Human
4myuac,"Thank you. I do think now on reflection it's a communication issue rather than any more.

I think I've allowed a build of this so this relatively small thing has become a bigger deal in my mind.",Human
4myuac,She isn't. She just won't have thought about it in an inconvience way. She likes doing her own so telling me would be an after thought.,Human
4myuac,"Then yeah, that's inconsiderate to the point of being selfish and rude. ",Human
4myuac,"I talked to her, probably not in the best way as it was late. But she said I'm being ridiculous and that I should have known her plans.

Furthermore, there is a great variety to the types of condoms you can get, some of which can even enhance female enjoyment through dots and ribs. There are some that make you last longer. There are some that are flavoured.

Rather, it's the negative side effects for each, which in this case as has been stated above, are VASTLY more for her than for you. She would have to deal with the daily stress of taking pills on time, the hormonal changes and imbalances that can cause huge issues with her body, and remembering to buy them in advance so she can continue to take them consistently. 


You have to deal with a little less feeling. 

That's why everyone is strongly on the girl's side in this one. However, what you could look into are alternate forms of birth control that don't involve condoms, such as the Depo - Provera shot that she can get once every three months (I'm a huge advocate and user of it), there's the patch, the implant, etc. Many of those have much fewer issues with side effects than the pill, and a whole lot less stress. 


What you SHOULD do is get an appointment with a nurse at Planned Parenthood or a gynecologist and figure out what would be best for her, if you absolutely refuse to wear a condom and want to continue a sexual relationship.

Edit: I read a ways down that you said you had NO feeling when you used a condom one time. If you can't come up with an alternate form of birth control, you'll just have to make do with a condom.

It also made me too weak to move, so i would literally have to lie on the floor of my disgusting college dorm bathroom so i could be close to the toilet.

Is she going to call you an asshole to her friends if you break things off for this reason? Probably. But if it means that much to you, birth control is a common thing despite complications for some.

4n1ljv,okay I can take that answer. But I wasn't making excuses I straight up copy pasted the response he had givien me. I told her the truth. and she cant just tag along that would be weird if my friend was like no just come alone and I bring her.,Human
4n1ljv,"byut again I want to reiterate this had nothing to do with her working out, she is trying to hop on that bandwagon after giving her news I am finally starting. which isn't a problem id love for her to work out. id love to work out with her. but my friend said come alone, and I cant teach her anything because I don't know anyhting",Human
4n1ljv,"yeah it's totally fine if you want to go alone, there are just better ways to tell someone that. ",Human
4n1ljv,"again, she's not looking for a teacher, just a workout partner. that part is important to remember.",Human
4n1ljv,"You're right, I'm not here to argue until I am not the asshole. If iata then iata but yes the context is true. Yes I could have gone about it differently too. I just struggle so much with her due to her anxiety, she over thinks EVERYTHING and before I can even explain anything to her she is at 100%",Human
4n1ljv,this is true. But this was originally about ME trying to find a TEACHER.,Human
4n1ljv,will work on it thanks for honest replies and listening to my side as well ,Human
4n1ljv,"You say you're changing your focus to strength and mobility training and how it's a bit more technical, then later on in the conversation you say you know zero workouts and all you want to do is calisthenics. Calisthenics are the exercises people have been doing in gym class since they were kids. You don't need a month of training to learn how to do a push up or a sit up. Yes, you are being an asshole for intentionally excluding your friend for no good reason. ",Human
4n1ljv,No that strength training message is a copy paste from MY friend that wants to train me. I know nothing. And this is a little more advanced than gym class,Human
4n1ljv,I see what you're saying. It's absolutely correct. But I also have trouble committing because of that same intimidation factor. I weigh 135 can fit my hands completely around my waist have 0 knowledge  o working out. Because of this I reached out to my friend to train me.because I know exactly how bad that fear is. This is all about a year after I had given up trying to work out with her. I finally found someone to train me which is what I've wanted. The last time she has mentioned to me working out was at least a year. How could I know she'd get mad at me now that I've found my help.,Human
4n1ljv,I can see the lacking context. People think we have been discussing this and trying to do this together. That's not the case. This was my deal ,Human
4n1ljv,"She didn't flip out for no reason. The way you responded to her was pretty cold and mean. Also that was barely a flip out, she wasn't getting through to you and then she decided to end the conversation. Do whatever you want but don't come crying to AITA when people don't like how you treated them. ",Human
4n1ljv,I'm not crying I'm posting this to learn from my mistakes see unbiased answers learn more about my thought process and make corrections to not be the asshole the next time I'm in a situation like this,Human
4n1ljv,I get that. I Do. I'm taking every word you said into serious consideration. Just humble me and take a step back. Do you understand that thid was never about us working out together. Yes that's the argument. But we havnt discussed worki bf out together in over a year. It has been behind us and we moved on. If she has wanted to work out in the past year she never mentioned it to me. So after a year of not working out or even discussing it together I went my own way and found the help that I was seeking. Now that I have my help she feels left out and wants to be a part of it which I get but my friend only said he has the time or ability to train only me. I will work on my acceptance of her anxiety but that's a whole different problem then what this was originally about. I had originally texted her because I was pour of myself for making that step to a healthier me and it turned into this. I just want you to understand that and if you do we can go back to the previous statements of anxiety,Human
4n1ljv,"Yes, I think you're being an asshole because you've given no good reason for why she can't work out with you. Especially if, as you say you have ""zero strength"" its not going to be a burden for someone else to join you. It's fine if you want to work out with this guy alone because you need some ""me time"" or whatever, but you've pitched it like this guy holds the key to fitness and only one person at a time can can learn the great fitness ways. Just today, I went into the gym at work where some of my co-workers were halfway through a calisthenics workout, and they asked if I wanted to join in. Because it's literally as easy as copying whoever is leading the workout, and no one cares if you do more reps or less reps or start in the middle of a workout or whatever. So whatever your girlfriend has wanted to do or not wanted to do in the past, it's obviously something that's important to her so you should make an effort to include her, or at least give her a less crappy excuse.",Human
4n1ljv,I didn't make an excuse that is literally copy and pasted what my friend told me. When I say this is what he said then sent a long message that is what my friend told me. The rest is me. Just clarifying. My friend told me to only come alone because he couldn't teach us both,Human
4n1ljv,"...Why not, first of all. And I assume you have access to the internet, so just google ""calisthenic workouts"" or ""whatever body part workout"" so if this guy can't teach both of you (despite her insisting that she doesn't need to be taught) do the internet workouts instead! Or since you're really into ""bettering yourself"" do both workouts!",Human
4n1ljv,"I don't think you're the asshole.  This is false drama, didn't need to happen. If she was actually interested in working out, she'd find a way to do it.  The idea that it should somehow be your responsibility to motivate her is ridiculous.  And the idea that you should work out with her because that is what she wants, instead of working out however you feel comfortable is also ridiculous.   ",Human
4n1ljv,I even offered to do both. ,Human
4n1ljv,I agree for some of it. I can see some of the points brought up by the others that I will try to improve on. But for the most part with all the context (which I made the mistake of leaving out at first) what I did wasn't that bad. B it yes stupid drama on both our parts,Human
4n1ljv,"Well I hope you work it out, and still get to work out. ",Human
4n1ljv,"That's fair, and I will go into the rest of this with that properly in mind.

But that only makes me wonder why you responded the way you did at all. It sounds like you'd prefer to move on from the idea of working out with her at all. Why the song and dance of training?",Human
4n1ljv,"After she was already mad about it, I'm assuming. Not from the beginning.",Human
4n1ljv,"You're not the asshole here. If she kept turning you down for two years, then decides all of a sudden that it's not fair, that's not your fault. You obviously care about proper form, as you should, and you want good tips from someone you can trust. That's fair. If she doesn't want the same thing, then you can't blame yourself for that. Also, if you two have been procrastinating working out together for the past two years, one more month isn't going to kill anybody. You just want to know what you're doing and make sure you aren't going to hurt yourself. That being said, if she actually does end up working out with you, I think you should compromise and go jogging with her.",Human
4n1ljv,"You could relay the message to your friend that she doesn't want to be taught, just wants someone to work out with, and he doesn't need to be ""monitoring her form"" or whatever, and maybe he would have let her come along? ",Human
4n1ljv,"Thank you. I've never heard anyone talk about anxiety like this. It is absolutely outside of your control sometimes, and it's hard for anybody who doesn't have experience with it to understand. It's not that I don't want to do things, it's just that it's simply too overwhelming for my emotional state.:/",Human
4n1ljv,Both assholes for texting a long conversation...,Human
4n1ljv,"This is painful like one of those movies where you just want to start screaming at the screen because the whole plot is based around some misunderstanding that would never happen in real life because people would actually just tell each other what was going on.

Anyway, no, you're not a complete asshole. However, you're doing two things here. One: you're being too single-minded about this. Why can't you train with this guy *and* work out with your friend on a more casual, friendly level? Secondly, it sounds like you got caught up in the need to defend yourself and explain why you were training with this other person. What you should have been doing was addressing the actual issue, which is your friend felt betrayed because (in her mind) you guys had been planning to work out together since *forever*. Just tell her (in a straightforward and non-challenging way) that you didn't realize she still wanted to work out together because she hadn't brought it up in a year and always seemed so busy before that.

She's sort of the asshole for overreacting, especially if she does other emotionally manipulative things on a regular basis. On the other hand, even if she's hugely overreacting here, her feelings make sense on some level - especially since you didn't do anything to clarify the situation.",Human
4n1ljv,"You are the asshole here. You refer to her once as your girlfriend, then the rest of the time as a friend or girl. Her being your girlfriend changes things! 

Her statement about having to stay in town shows that you guys traditionally have other plans where you hang out in the evening. Now you tell her you are changing plans without even trying to have a discussion about it. You ignore this concern of hers, instead becoming defensive about why she can't go. She hadn't even asked at this point to go with you, and you immediately shut that down. That alone makes you an asshole. Obviously she's going to be upset about the change in plans and then you saying yeah you can't go.

You don't even try to address her concerns or offer a compromise. You try to blame your friend for why she can't go by copying his message. Rather than addressing it as a guy thing or even trying to explain why you want to start working out with him instead of her, you just post his mesage. Then when she tries to disengage, probably to think about it, you ask her why she's mad. She tells you, only to have you ignore everything she has said and tell her she is over reacting. That makes you an asshole too. You don't ask someone why they are feeling sketching them tell them that, especially not your girlfriend who should be able to trust you to tell you how she feels. 

You saying that she hasn't asked you to workout in a long time is because she gave up on the idea. You state yourself that she tried to have",Human
4n1ljv,"She's never asked me to run ever so idk why she mentions it. Hiking yes and I've tried to get her to go many times. As far as discussing it that was the original intention of mentionING it to her. I tell her my friend wants to start trelaining with me and at first she is cool about it. Then I inform her my friend wants me to come alone and all of a sudden it's a problem. I got over her trying to work out with me a long time ago. She would never tag along and would make excuses when I'd try and go.I showed her the exact message he said because I felt telling the truth would be far better than lying and saying it's a guy thing.. I don't think it's so much as she gave up on the idea but more I gave up asking her because she would never go. She missed her chance basically. But I even tell her I am still willing and capable of working out with her. I don't really see how my last message was a red flag. She had expressed Zero interest in working out in the past year how could I possibly know that now that I've gone out of my way to get the help I need she wants to tag along. As far as hanging out in the evening as per our usual habit, she stays at my house or I stay at hers every night, one hour away should not be an issue.she has some severe anxiety problems and being extremely clingy is a part of it. BUT I know it's mostly out of her control but the tension it puts on me daily is intense. I absolutely have to fight if I want to do anything alone and it's an argument 100% of the t",Human
4n1ljv,I think there is also a lot of stuff working against me that I just ignored in her texts. For instance her saying she's been asking to work out with me for sooo long. It's true she has asked me in the past to work out with her. But every time I'd try she would bail. Eventually I am going to stop asking her. I chose to ignore it in the messages because it would just be more fighting if I called her oUT on it,Human
4n1ljv,"Asshole. The main reason is you are entirely at fault for escalating this.

*Multiple times* she gave you an out. *Multiple times* she asked you to stop, give her time and leave her alone. But here you come with another short novel! Sometimes people get upset for irrational reasons and know it's silly. That self-awareness unfortunately isn't enough to just immediately resolve those feelings. You just need a little time.

She was asking you to give her time to chill and get over it, but fuck what she wanted, you wanted to fight about it. Now you're annoyed that you fought about it? Don't pick at people when they're trying to drop it. ",Human
4n1ljv,"point taken and will work on it, but my reason for doing it (which isn't a good reason I admit) is because she constantly says things or does something that bothers me then says leave me alone not giving me a chance to try and explain myself or add my opinion. It effectively takes my voice away and all that does is make me more angry",Human
4n1ljv,"Because she doesn't need you to explain. She already knows you're right or at least that it's a petty thing where no one is really right. That's why I say it's irrational. 

At the very least, you don't need to escalate an already tense situation just because you feel like you need to get a word in. You can revisit it when you're both calm and it's not a fight and still have a voice.",Human
4n1ljv,"I already have moved away from working out with her, that's why this was an argument I had no clue she still wanted to work out before she got upset about me working out with a friend. So since she is my gf I tried to tell her I may start training with a friend and then she probably felt left out and then arguing and stuff happened",Human
4n1ljv,"I feel like this is the only response that accurately saw how I felt about the situation, I can definitely compromise and run as well",Human
4n1ljv,"you're right I did get one minded and side tracked, will keep in mind what you said and try to be more gentle in the future and not skirt around the fire",Human
4n1ljv,very true will try and remember this in the future,Human
4n1ljv,"You need to reread your own texts. You were the one that mentioned running. 

The fact that you are trying so hard to argue and give reasons that you aren't the asshole is pretty telling. 

How old are you dude? Because I get the impression you haven't been in many relationships because your communication skills suck. And an hour away? Jeez dude I don't know where you live but that's a sizable commute.

Glad you ain't my problem.",Human
4n1ljv,"You read all the responses until you found one you agreed with, and seem to be arguing against all the others.",Human
4n1ljv,"Things working against you? I'm saying the stuff you ignore is what she would feel is important. Not ""calling her out"" on anything but acknowledging why she would be upset. Ignrongnwhat the other person says is not having an actual conversation. You are only focusing on three or so statements she made that you can actually complain about rather than focusing on everything else she had to say.",Human
4n1ljv,"I have taken all into consideration,  I will defend my perspective but even on all the ones calling me an asshole I have made a note of it and will try to not make the same mistakes. Some people have the story slightly confused because I left no context in the beginning and I try to add the context other than that I have done nothing but try to improve my mindset",Human
4n1ljv,"Will keep it in mind, but what she ffeels is important is that she is left out and wants to join me, my friend said come alone, and I have given up trying to get her to join me a long time ago. We have tried doing this together in the past and it never worked out. So I stopped trying to get her to come along with me. So yes she may feel it is important but it is not my fault she has not taken me up on my offer for over a year then gets upset when I try to go alone",Human
4n1ljv,"not an hour away. 5 minutes away. and an hour long workout. I'm giving reasons to clarify my perspective which gives readers an insight on my thought process which allows them to point out what I am doing incorrectly allowing me to realize my mistakes and improve. If I am the asshole than I am the asshole I cant change that and I am not trying to. I mentioned I hate running because she said in the texts ""ive tried getting you to run with me in he past"" which is partly true. She has asked me MAYBE once to run and I told her id rather not and as a compromise we decided on hiking. But when id try and get her to come she would bail on me",Human
4n1ljv,What people need to understand most is that I gave up trying to get her to work out with me long time ago. Working out together has not been discussed in over a year because she constantly bailed on me. Prior to linked messages there was no talk of working out together or finding someone to train us together. I went off on my own to find a friend to teach me because she wouldn't ever go with me. This was my own thing that she had no part of. This was my decision to look for help because together we got nothing done ,Human
4n1ljv,"Dude, you came here to ask if you were being an asshole, we said that you were, but you're just defending and defending and you don't want an impartial judgement, you just wanted reassurance that your shitty choice was the right one. HUGE ASSHOLE.",Human
4n1ljv,"I am defending I am not denying that. I do believe that I was being the asshole after everything being said by everyone. I have seriously taken 100% of all of your perspectives into consideration. I admit at some points I do defend because in *some* aspects I still believe that I am correct, obviously not every aspect. That being said I did not ask people to come in here and judge me on my responses to people I asked for it on our conversation.

Can you bring your friend to his parents another time? Sounds like he won't get back on track as long as he doesn't move in with them...",Human

He can't just stay on your couch forever. You have a life and so does your SO and you can't just keep him in you and your partners home. I think he should have gone to live with his parents weeks ago. It seems like you feel guilty for giving him a place to stay, given that it sounds like a shit hole, it's still a place to sleep. He's probably been in worse off places. Your SO is right to not allow him on the couch and if I was in your situation I probably wouldn't have even let him in the house because of how much he's used my kindness without showing improvement. He is your friend, but he's also an addict. He needs to realise that if he doesn't act on his words he'll just spiral down, and will be the worst father figure to his kids.",Human

In this situation, who knows? There are two different perception of what had happened, who is to say which was right.

4n4z9i,"Oh not at all, wasn't really an argument with her, I didn't really brought it up afterwards as I deemed it unnecessary.

I 100% agree with you on that first paragraph, btw.",Human

If it's that unclear in person, you may be unfairly assuming malicious intent where a lack of clarity is to blame.

Really, just in general, you're an asshole for road rage. You're driving a potentially deadly machine, capable of doing extensive non-lethal damage as well. Every time you get angry and act on it with your car, the question is ""does my anger warrant killing/hurting someone or costing them hundreds if not thousands in repairs?"" I know I wouldn't feel okay about that over a fucking spot in line.",Human

4n4z9i,"Still not getting the issue. Sounds like a basic zipper merge, which is *supposed* to happen at the end of the lane. You're not skipping the line doing so, you're correctly merging two lines into one.",Human
4n4z9i,The bigger issue here is people not knowing how to merge properly.,Human
4n4z9i,"I'm not sure then... Maybe most people assumed Lane 3 was supposed to be the correct line and Lane 2 wasn't being used. It was pretty unfair for everyone in the line to see people skipping it though, a line was still being formed behind me. Might've been a huge misunderstaing.",Human
4n4z9i,"Okay, thats good. ",Human
4n4z9i,"Ah, the age old queue vs. zipper merge controversy.  If lane there does indeed merge with lane two at the end, then ideally both lanes should be used up to the merge point and then cars should alternate, much like a ski liftline.  So yes, I'm afraid that it appears you are the asshole.  Sorry. ",Human
4n4z9i,"There is meant to still be a line behind you though, as well as a line in lane 2. If lane 2 is not meant to feed into the gate what is it for? The actual issue here is that everyone went into lane 3 when lane 2 was empty, giving opportunity for people to feel slighted. I don't think you're an asshole but neither are the other guys. ",Human
4n4z9i,"Fair enough! That's unfortunate, then hahaha.",Human
4n4z9i,"This is the most encouraging answer yet, thanks, haha.",Human
4n4z9i,"I'd say you're not the asshole. Maybe you could have avoided yelling at the guy from Lane 2, but I can't call you an asshole for saying that in the heat of the moment. ",Human
4n4z9i,"Thanks man, good to know someone saw it like I did as well. ",Human
4n4z9i,"I would agree that you're the asshole here, or at least you should be. I think the real problem is that people don't know how to merge properly. I don't know where you're from, but I know that a common expectation in the US is that people should merge as soon as they are aware of the bottleneck, and  so people who stay in the ""other"" lane until the end (often moving faster because most people have already merged) are assholes for trying to skip the line. The thing is, the people who merge early are wrong. It's [better for everyone](http://www.dot.state.mn.us/zippermerge/) if both lanes go until the end and then zipper merge.

So, in the end, it's hard to say you're the asshole if people (including you) where live don't know how to merge. That said, it can be good to be assertive while driving, but you should also be understanding. I try to assume people might have a good reason to act the way they do. ",Human

Similarly, there's a folk singer named John Prine.  I don't really like any other folk singers, but he's awesome.  

He's got a song called ""Spanish Pipedream"" and the chorus is ""Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own""

I don't want to find Jesus, but I love that song.

No, they would have been slowly progressing forward as each person at the front passed through security.

Without you, she would move into a cheaper place and be fine. You are part of the reason she is broke, and therefore you should help her alleviate that by paying more rent. Either that, or move into a cheaper place. ",Human

Of course if she asked you to help her out and you can but refuse that would be assholish but it seems like she is capable of paying her share just doesn't want to so she can have more free money for non-necessities. ",Human
4namte,"I think that is the key. He should either pay more or move I to a cheaper place. Anything else is asking his girlfriend to sacrifice if she wants to live him. Beyond that, if he thinks she has trouble handling money in general, that's a separate issue (which should probably also be addressed at some point).",Human
4namte,It's almost as if being frugal is a relative term. ,Human
4namte,"You're not the asshole for wanting it to be 50/50 on principle, but I'd say you're kind of an asshole for getting such an expensive place that, though you can afford it, she has to lower her standard of living to be able to afford. 
Honestly I'd have gotten a cheaper place and gone comfortably 50/50 so that this person you care about doesn't have to make sacrifices to live with you. ",Human

4namte,This is a hard one. I made more money than my S/O so we split the rent according. Bills and everything else was 50/50.,Human
4namte,"i dont think you're being an asshole at all. if anything i think she's the one being the asshole. she's spending her dentist money on clothes or plants, that's her call. she wants you to subsidize her living a lifestyle she can't afford

maybe you should talk to her about you guys downsizing into a cheaper place so she can afford the other things she can't afford now

what this is really probably about is that she is trying to move you guys closer to your money being ""our"" money. that may or may  not be valid depending on how long you two have been together but that's what this is really about i would think",Human
4namte,"Of course you should split it based on how much you earn. Making twice as much is quite a lot, and if you should pay the exact same for all the base costs it'll be massively unfair. Sure, she could get a better education and a better job or whatever it would take for her to make as much money as you, but what would happen with rent then? Should she still pay 50% of all the base costs despite her not earning shit? And why would that situation be any different from your situation right now?

I would pay a percentage of the wage to a shared account which you use only for bills, rent and stuff you buy together (like furniture or stuff). 1/5 of your pay or something like that going to home, electricity, TV and whatever seems more fair than her paying half of what she makes while you only pay 1/4.",Human
4namte,"No, unless you've agreed to carry her, it's not your responsibility that she's living beyond her means.  

A compromise: Stop taking her out to dinner and apply that savings to her side of things, on the condition that she stop spending money on luxuries before her necessities are met. ",Human
4namte,"Not an asshole. Any assistance on your part should be voluntary. If you pay a dentist bill, and she buys a new dress, essentially you've bought her a dress. ",Human
4namte,"For what it's worth, I don't subscribe to the ""our money"" philosophy and I still agree with this. I have my money and he has his, together we try to maintain a frugal but rewarding lifestyle, but in the end we keep our finances separate. When it comes to rent, he pays less than I do. He makes slightly less than I do too, but it's not by the same percentage. The reason I don't charge him as much in rent is because I would live here whether he was with me or not. We can afford to split it 50/50, but if he was not living with me, he would likely live someplace cheaper. I am the one who set the standard of living, so I pay slightly more for that.

OP is probably not an asshole for setting it up as 50/50 to begin with, because his gf likely agreed to it before she realized she cannot afford their place, but now that she knows that, they need to move to a cheaper place. If OP doesn't want to do that, then he needs to change the payment percentage, or else then he is an asshole. IMO",Human
4namte,"I was the girlfriend in a very similar situation. He wanted to live downtown to be closer to his school so we agreed before getting the apartment that I would pay 1/3 of the rent and he would cover the rest. 1/3 of the rent was the amount I was paying for an apartment outside of downtown. We split everything else evenly, except he would pay for maybe 65% of restaurant meals. After a while he brought up the issue again because the uneven rent really added up, so I agreed to pay for the extra $50 increase in rent every year. We are now engaged and living in a new city, and our funds will be combining when we get married so it really didn't matter in the end. If you are in a serious relationship, I would consider helping her out or moving somewhere more affordable for both your incomes, especially if student loans are an issue for you.",Human

I think OP could work harder at coming to a more even solution but I don't think it's fair to brand him the asshole simply because he doesn't want to pay for someone elses stuff. Maybe if she wants more money she could use that as motivation to get a better job? Him just handing her more money because they're dating is super creepy and weird and can make a weird relationship dynamic.,Human
4namte,I totally agree with your first point but your second point is incredibly specific to your situation and doesn't nessasarily apply here.,Human
4namte,"On the other hand, she agreed to the situation and is responsible for her living arrangement. She would do better to move to a cheaper place within her means and have OP decide to move with her or not. I don't feel like he is automatically responsible for paying for her rent when it was essentially her decision.",Human
4namte,Good points. It's hard to say what the best thing to  do is since we don't know all the details of their relationship. Hopefully this thread has given OP plenty of perspectives on the situation so that he and his girlfriend can decide what they want to do together. ,Human
4namte,"Everyone is jumping up OPs ass over the medical bills thing like OP is martin shkreli or something and y'all need to calm down. I don't think OP is preventing his girlfriend from getting chemo so everyone just settle.

It's a tricky situation to be in. You want to help the person you're with but you don't want to set bad precedents or get taken advantage of. OP, I feel you.

That being said, you could probably be doing more. Maybe discuss an interest-free loan to help get her on her feet so she's not putting things off that would raise her quality of life? This is only if the money is being spent on worthwhile things though. If she just wants to live beyond her means because you make more and she feels entitled to it? That ain't a good look and I'd try to either make her see that's what she's doing and maybe she'll realize it's gross or she won't and then you gotta cut it off.

So if OP makes twice as much as girlfriend, she should only pay one third of rent, utilities, groceries, whatever else they agree on (meals out, medical costs, car maintenance, things for the home). 2:1 income ratio, so for rent OP pays  ~1100, girlfriend pays ~575.

OP, you all are living together, not just as roommates but because you want to share your lives with each other. Fair isn't always a 50/50 split.",Human

How on earth is it creepy and weird to help out someone if they're struggling? The point of having a significant other is that you're finding the person who is your potential future husband/wife. You're not boyfriend/girlfriend just because you bump uglies on occasion.

It is that cut and dry. Money doesn't complicate anything, it's your perception of what money is that's complicating it. If it was a stranger, I agree with you, but this person is supposed to have a special significance to OP. If that person does not hold a special significance, don't call her your girlfriend, because she isn't. You're just fuck buddies.

What if the girl can't 'just get a better job?' the market for jobs that aren't waitress jobs or minimum wage are in the shitter. Look around you. This is a global issue. I'm in the IT industry, one of the highest demand job markets out there, and last time I was jobless, it took me 6+ months to find a new job. What if she's in college, and can only work part time? You're telling me she should go to college, work a full time job, and if that's not enough, get a second job, while working on homework and everything else because you're too god damn greedy to spare another $100-200?

4namte,"Strawman. 

That's not what I'm saying at all. Don't twist my words around. If you're claiming someone as your significant other, you help out, instead of saying 'LOL YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN KID.' That's what you do when you're interested in, or love someone. Same goes for your family and friends. I would expect this from both people in a relationship. I'm also not saying that a girlfriend means that you have to spend all of your money on her, but you should take her out once in a while, and help her out when she has problems, and you have extra money laying around. 

OP stated he makes twice as much money as her, but he is not willing to help her. The reason she is having issues is because she is living out of her means to be with him. He should help out, because he has a moral and ethical responsibility to help out a fellow human being that he claims to care about. It's not about the money. It's about showing her that she actually means something to OP. If OP was broke, I wouldn't expect him to give her money, but there are other ways he can help out. That's what you do when you care for someone, you help out. That's not sexism, that's called being a motherfucking decent human being. 

I'm old school. I come from a time where you took your girl out to a nice restaurant, and bought her gifts once in a while.

Everything she's asking to buy is either an essential (medical bills, car), will last a long time (clothing, the car) or benefits you both (furniture and decorations for the apartment). If she was out of pocket due to poor budgeting I might be more sympathetic but that doesn't appear to be the case.

It's nice that you are willing to help her out with her medical bills, but that's not the issue - she wants to be able to pay for her own necessities and the only thing that stops her is that she lives with you. That's not fair at all.",Human

And you're within your rights to decide that and do so but pretending like there's no way anyone could feel differently or come to a different conclusion in a similar situation is kinda gross. You can disagree all you want but don't belittle the opposite argument because you're defending your own position from a very subjective place. Simple. Easy.",Human
4namte,"The two are not synonymous. Obviously you have to be optimistic about a relationship, if you're cynical and pessimistic about it, what's the point of carrying on?

It's not irresponsible decision making. It's a decision made together, and with the various risks considered. We have a break clause, we have a contract with our letting agent. My point is that it's no more irresponsible than committing to living together in the first place. After all, if he were an arsehole, then taking advantage of this situation isn't so easy. We're both on the lease, if he decided to stop paying rent then he's liable too. 

By your reckoning, at what point is it sensible to make the decision to pool finances for living arrangements? My friend owns a house with her boyfriend (and they pay different amounts on the mortgage), that's a lot more permanent, and if it goes wrong then it's much harder to get out of the situation than just a rental. But they knew that when they decided to buy in the first place. 

At the end of the day, it's common for one half of the couple to have more money than the other half. If you've decided to share your life together then at some point that's got to include money as well. 

I am not saying this is the only way to think, I just said I disagree with your particular point of view. OP was looking for perspectives on his situation; you offered yours, I offered mine.

4nsc2x,"Yeah, we're a gay couple (married).  ",Human
4nsc2x,"Actually, I explained it to my SO clearly that last year, the friend  obviously had money because he bought tons of alcohol when we got there.  That he spent money on alcohol but didn't offer to help pay for a $800 dollar hotel stay or any gas money made me angry.

And yeah, we were going with or without him, and he'd go with or without us.  He has a car and is capable of driving himself.  So why is it that we're driving him, and he's not taking us? He already got a favor last year, now he's going for it again.  In fact, an hour ago he asked if his friend could also join us for the ride. 

Based on responses I'm seeing here though, nobody agrees with me so I'm clearly in the wrong (this is not sarcasm).  I must be missing something here so I'll re-evaluate and see if I can have a break through.  I'm stubborn so this kind of situation where I see things narrowly is not new to me. 

I've already apologized to my husband and said that we will have a good time, it's not worth fighting over.  At least, I don't want HIM to have to be in a bad mood.  I'm still upset about this but I'm masking it really well (I didn't say a peep when friend asked if his other friend could come along).  ",Human
4nsc2x,"We're married on 4 years, so the car is ours and we don't have a clear division of finances, joint account and such.

So far the consensus is that IATA, so I'll just have to take time to evaluate what's happening and hopefully come to the realization of how I am in the wrong sooner rather than later.  I'm still upset about this internally, but I'll handle it fine. ",Human
4nsc2x,"Man i think that is a problen right there. Just my opinion, but if my wife was hoing around back in the day before we met the last thing i want is for to be buddy buddy with someone she fucked. Forget the stupid cliche of being adults. That is my qife. So i see some of the problem on your husbands end. He shouldnt be hanging with people he has slept with. He is married and should be devoted to you. I feel that aside from being a freeloader, you might feel uncomfortable because there is a sexual past between the 2. Fuck the just friends stunt. Either one gets too drunk and there is a possible situation that can get out of hand.


However from a strictly friends point of view, there are friends that just might not have much money. There are times where i have been broke but my social circle still has me along and takes care of me because we like each others company and vice versa. Sometimes you want your friend along for the ride.

I personally give you a pass though. I would never hang out with people i fucked in the past while married and wouldnt want my wife to eother. We are devoted to each other. I dont want any high school or college aged bullshit about being adults and being able to hang out with fuck buddies to be in my relationship.",Human
4nsc2x,"It seems like you wouldn't be happy to be around this extra guy in any case, is that right?",Human
4nsc2x,"As you give us more information I would say that you are looking less like the asshole. I think it's fair that his friend should drive you guys this time, to pay you back for last year. Especially if he wants to bring another friend.

Otherwise I think it is fair if you wanted to do this with just your so. Car trips can be crazy fun with some one you know well. I hope you've spoken with your so about this. Mention that you tried this last year and you didn't like how the guy was behaving and you think you'd have more fun if it were just you and the so. 

Anyway. It really depends on how your so is reacting to this. If you haven't tried talking to him about your misgivings and decide to suck it up instead, knowing that this will dampen your fun, you are the ass. But if you've tried talking to your so and he's told you to get over it or ignored your concerns, he's the asshole.",Human
4nsc2x,"Well for one I really do hate freeloaders. But the other thing is they're not even friends so why do we keep helping him out. Just because you fuck ed in the past? 

My husband doesn't even have anything to say to the guy. Last year I had to do all the talking so that there wasn't awkward silence. Finally when his ""friend"" was gone, I said why aren't you talking to your friend? And my husband said idk I don't really know him, we only hooked up and never hung out. And finally when we got to edc my husband suggested that the other guy and we should go our separate ways because my husband didn't want to hang around him all night. 

This is really frustrating to help out someone who is essentially a stranger. But my husband keeps on saying it's fine to help out a friend. BUT YOURE NOT FRIENDS! and I don't want to pretend to be nice again.",Human
4nsc2x,"yeah, yall need to talk. to me going through all that trouble and shit just to not even talk to the guy is weird. to me that raises a red flag. I think the worst. Did you originally want him along to fuck if yall ever got alone, kinda like a risky exciting deal and the argued behind the scenes to get to the no talking scenario? That's how I am wired though. I am selfish with my wife and she respects that. I think the whole situation is weird.",Human
4nsc2x,I don't think you are the asshole.  I would feel the same way.  Your SO should have really cleared it with you before he offered someone else a ride AND a stay in your guy's hotel.  ESPECIALLY if he's a former FWB,Human
4nsc2x,"You are definitely the asshole but I think your own misunderstanding and resentment comes from a different way of viewing relationships. It seems like with your friends everything is very evenly split, tit-for-tat style relationship. Which is fine but it is not the only way to do it. 

Your husband seems to favor a relationship where he shares and payback isn't really ever considered. 

Neither relationship style is better but you need to understand that his relationship with his friend is HIS relationship. And so long as it is not negatively impacting you, as in this case where you're not actually losing anything, then you should probably back off. It's not really about you. ",Human
4nt23z,"You're cleaning up after him?  No, you're not the asshole. ",Human
4nt23z,"Seems completely reasonable, so not the asshole, but that frustration tends to mount so be careful. Not everyone is ready to live with their SO.",Human
4nt23z,"No it's not you, I have a small kitchen and it's a one at a time deal, no other way to do it.  Aside from that you two need to work out who does what in the kitch for cleaning and cooking. In our house we have specific designated tasks that are always ours, we don't switch and it isn't arbitrary. It works great since there is no question who does what. I load the dishwasher and he empties, I cook and he packs up the food, I clean the sink and counters and he does the pots and pans. This way if the dishes are stacked on counter it's always on me, if the clean dishes aren't put away it's on him. ",Human
4nt23z,We've been living together for over 3 years at this point. Frustration is definitely mounting.,Human
4nt23z,"That is genius, but he tends to not take responsibility for the chores that actually are his. So if he had to wash the pots, I'd end up cooking on every single pot we had until I ended up washing them myself.",Human
4nt23z,Set rules and make compromises. Don't let it build up. Good luck &lt;3,Human
4nt23z,"You need to nix that asap. Whether it's with a chore wheel or simply having some kind of policy that if he waits too long to wash them, you are allowed to remind him and he's not allowed to get mad at you (this is just an example - It's best if you come up with something together).

You're not his mother. Your relationship is going to start to erode if you start feeling like the mother to a sulky teenager.

Present it like a problem you need help solving. For example: ""Hey babe... I have an issue that's been bothering me for a while. I'm starting to feel like I'm always the one washing dishes and cleaning up. It's making me feel resentful and I really don't want to feel like that. Can you help me think up a good solution?"" Feel free to phrase your own version however you like of course.",Human
4nt23z,"I don't know if this will help, but I have found there are chores that my SO really hates, for example hanging up laundry to dry (they hate the feel of damp clothes). Our compromise was that we drew up a list of things that each of us disliked or were incapable of doing (clutter is invisible to me) and assigned chores according to that. The other thing that really helps is if you both do chores together, even if they are in different parts of the house so that one person isn't having fun on the Xbox while the other stews in the kitchen. This also ensures that division of time spent is approximately equal- if one partner finishes first, they come help the other.",Human
4nt23z,): this makes me sad,Human
4nt23z,"if he is trying to cook *while* you're cleaning the stove, no you are not the asshole",Human
4nt23z,Well you are the one cleaning for you both so no,Human
4nt23z,"&gt; but he tends to not take responsibility for the chores that actually are his.

We have ours on a spreadsheet so there's no confusion. 

&gt;I'd end up cooking on every single pot

Ya, you two need to talk about this and find out why he thinks that as an adult person he shouldn't have to clean up the shared household messes.  Quite a bit of this comes down to what his house/family was like when he grew up, did his mom do all the kitchen duties? Then he just might subconsciously think you should be doing all of that.  I dealt with this in my current relationship (still dealing to a certain extent) but we had some talks and found some middle ground though it took a long goddamned time to work through it.  The spreadsheet posted on the fridge really helped us since there was no question about what should be done. 

",Human
4nt23z,"No. He needs to grow up. I would stop cleaning up after him. If you have no clean pots or pans because he won't clean up after himself then it looks like you are goi mg out to get take out without him. If he refuses to take responsibility for his stuff you, as want to consider if he does this with other aspects of his life or just the chores. It could be this is his one flaw. If it isn't it is time to reassess things and decide what you want out of this relationship and if you are likely to get it.",Human
4nt7z4,No.  That's silly to even argue about. ,Human
4nt7z4,"If she didn't ask you to donate to the clinic before you put the chip in, then no, you're not the asshole.",Human
4nt7z4,What if she had? I feel like it wouldn't have changed the situation tbh.,Human
4nt7z4,"I think it would have. She obviously feels strongly about the eye care thing, but you're not emotionally or personally invested in the homeless shelter thing (as far as I can tell). It would be kind of mean if she nicely asked you to support the clinic and you said no.",Human
4nt7z4,"Yeah she said very similar things. My general idea was that there should be some independence and that I shouldn't have to justify how much I care about something in order to have a valid opinion. 

Does that change anything for you or am I still sort of a dick?",Human
4nt7z4,First of all why does it matter to you if she's your ex and why does she even care? She sounds like an overdramatic person if she said that you dont care about her because you donated to the wrong charity like what the fuck ,Human
4nt7z4,"I care because it sort of blew my mind that it was an issue. She made me doubt a lot of stuff I thought was normal, and myself because of that. ",Human
4nt7z4,"Not the asshole. Where you donate is your business. If she wants to donate to the clinic then that's her right, and she also has the right to ask you to donate to the clinic that she likes. But it's also well within your right to choose for yourself.  ",Human
4nt7z4,"I don't think you should have felt compelled to donate to the thing she said regardless if she told you or not. It's your money, do with it what you want. While it is important to support your SO, not everything you do needs to support her decisions. ",Human
4nt7z4,"You're not an asshole for that. It's your money, and either way it's going to a good cause. There's nothing stopping her from buying a coffee and putting her chip into the charity of her choice if she's deeply passionate about it.

In response to your edit, it may not have been a big deal to accomodate her, but you were under no obligation to do so. Furthermore, it was such a small gesture that while it would have been sweet to support her charity, she's being rude by making a big deal of it.",Human
4nt7z4,"Honestly, she sounds a tad controlling. If you were passionate about homelessness I doubt you'd have expected her to donate to your charity over hers, so she has no business doing so to you.",Human
4nt7z4,"Yeah that's my thought, that I wouldn't ever expect that of her. I worry that a lot of people see relationships as requiring more ideological sacrifice than I expected.",Human
4nt7z4,"Any person telling another how to define their charity priorities is the asshole.

Also, if:
&gt;it was such a small gesture, it shouldn't have been a big deal to accommodate her

Then it shouldn't have been a big deal for her to be understanding.

Edit: line breaks",Human
4ntkig,"Under those circumstances you were the person who had to drive, but you did not have to hit the raccoon. Shit happens and if you break shit you pay for it. It is your fault that she needs to repair her car. If you refuse to pay for this, you're definitely the asshole. How much she drank that night doesn't change the fact that you've damaged  her property.",Human
4ntkig,"Mm, it's complicated. You definitely have some responsibility but you were put in a rough situation. See if she'll split the costs.",Human
4ntkig,"I don't think you're the asshole, with one caveat. She gets too drunk to drive, her fault, her problem. Totally not okay to get too drunk to drive when you drove somewhere. She should blame herself for losing control of the night by getting sloshed. 

However, if you had also been drinking then I think you're culpable, as you choose to drive her car while under the influence. ",Human
4ntkig,"You're definitely the asshole here. While I agree that you had to drive in this situation, it is completely your fault that you broke the car, not your friend's. Maybe you could try to agree on splitting the bill since your friend put you in a shitty position but on a technical as well as a moral level, I believe that it's your responsibility to pay for the damages",Human
4ntkig,"Eh..... Asshole. But if it's any consolation, it's close. It's good that you took matters into your own hands and didn't let a drunk person drive, so props for that. However, if you're driving her car and damage it, regardless of the circumstance, I think you have a responsibility to compensate for the damages. Rough situation, I know, but that's really the right thing to do. ",Human
4ntkig,"If you had hit a stationary object, I'd say you should own up to the damages. If hitting the raccoon was unavoidable, like most animals are when they dart in front of a car last second, I'd say your friend should suck it up and pay. ",Human
4ntkig,He didn't have to hit the raccoon... What does that mean? They had to get home and only one person could drive.  OP didn't go out of their way to hit the raccoon. OP doesn't say they hit the raccoon due to their negligence.  How is he liable for that in your eyes? ,Human
4ntkig,You are the asshole for giving this advice. ,Human
4ntkig,"No, I wasn't drinking",Human
4ntkig,"I don't get this.  It's not like he hit a mailbox.  A raccoon is, in a sense,  an act of God in terms of responsibility.  Unless he swerved to hit it I don't see how anyone can fault someone for running over an animal that darts into the road.  That's like saying it's his fault if someone rear ended them while txting.  It's not the drivers fault just because they were driving. ",Human
4ntkig,"I disagree. I think that if you're driving someone else's vehicle, you take responsibility for it for that amount of time. It sucks that that raccoon ran out into the road, and it might not be their fault, but they should still take responsibility for it.",Human
4ntkig,"It doesn't matter how they crashed the car, they crashed it so they have to pay for it. I agree with the top comment that OP should offer to split the costs, however this accident was his fault entirely. When you're driving someone's vehicle, you're responsible for it. OP damaged the vehicle. You can blame the raccoon all you want, but the raccoon can't pay for it, and OP is the only other person who had any control over the situation. He could have swerved, slowed down. Honestly, for the car to be this busted up by such a small thing, he was probably going a little too fast. You can hit a small animal without fucking up a car in most cases. If it were a cat or a dog he had hit, OP would be having to pay someone to replace their pet right now. You do your best to avoid road hazards and when *you* fuck up, *you* pay for it. ",Human
4ntkig,I'd be with you if he borrowed the car but he was driving the drunk owner home.  At the very most he should split the cost but I still don't think he should pay at all.  How much would 2 taxis or a tow have coated the owner if OP didn't drive? ,Human
4ntkig,But the OP DID drive. I think it would be unfair to the car's owner to make them cover the cost of repairs when they weren't the ones driving it at the time. ,Human
4ntkig,"I see your point, but I don't think it's that black and white. First of all, it's not his fault that he hit the raccoon. That's like saying it's his fault if a tornado came through and destroyed the car. It was purely an act of nature (assuming OP isn't hiding anything). I've hit two deer and a rabbit my driving career, and each time they came out of nowhere before I could react (even with my brights on). Slamming on your brakes and swerving is always dangerous and just isn't worth the risk to avoid a raccoon. Maybe humans shouldn't have built roads through wild animals' homes, but you can't blame OP for hitting the coon. OP's friend shouldn't have gotten hammered if she needed to drive. If anything, she should be thanking OP for taking the keys and be grateful that it was him hitting a raccoon, rather than her drunkenly crashing and getting herself or someone else injured or killed. If I was OP's friend, I'd own up to my irresponsibility and be reasonable about it. I wouldn't make my friend (who drove me home when I was too fucked up, to boot) take the blame and the bill for something that couldn't have been avoided. ",Human
4ntkig,"You're not the asshole. She got drunk and was unable to safely get herself home. She entrusted you to do that. Because of you, she's alive. People in /r/relationships talk about the asshole tax, and that's what the cost of fixing the car is for her. Don't be an asshole and get so drunk that you can't drive yourself home. Hopefully she learns the lesson and stays within her limits in the future. ",Human
4ntkig,"I understand what the other side of this argument is. Legally, OP is responsible for the damages to the vehicle he was driving. Technically, his friend could sue him if she wanted to. I think OP should definitely take some responsibility for the situation. As it stands, OP hasn't even offered to split the costs. Refusing any responsibility here makes him an asshole in my book. I think the moral thing to do would be to offer to cover half the costs. To take at least partial responsibility for the situation. He was driving, he has at least some responsibility for this.",Human
4ntkig,"Legality isn't always in line with morality. If she took it to court, I'd consider her an asshole. I think in a situation like this, the law is an asshole. I'd pay for half of it as a compromise just to get the situation over with, but flat-out blaming OP and giving them full responsibility is bullshit. He may be legally held responsible, but that's bullshit as well. It's a very sticky situation, but I still think OP's friend is being irrational. Either way, this would be something totally stupid to lose a friend over.",Human
4ntkig,But the *only* reason the owner wasn't driving was because she was too drunk. If she wants to charge him for this then would you agree he should charge her for the drive home?,Human
4ntkig,"But this isn't r/legaladvice, it's r/amitheasshole. Sure, OP might have a legal case in small claims court, but she'd be a major asshole for suing him. She's definitely the asshole for saying: ""yes, I would have been stranded out there if you didn't drive me home but you owe me for the entirely unpredictable and un-preventable accident that happened while you did me the favour.""",Human
4ntkig,"Let's keep in mind that the OP was with her while she was getting drunk. It's not the OP's responsibility to make sure she handles herself properly, but they still may have been able to stop the situation from getting out of hand. But, since it did, the OP had to deal with it. What happened to the OP really sucks, but it's not like they are in the clear here. If they want to try and work out a deal where the OP pays half of the damages, that seems reasonable. But they are an asshole for trying to deny any financial responsibility when they were the one who was driving the car when it was damaged in the first place. ",Human
4ntkig,"You still didn't answer my question. If she can charge him for the damages can he charge her for the drive itself? You're right he didn't make her drink nor was he responsible for her drinking. He was doing her a favour by not drinking and driving them home. By your strict logic of responsibility, she should pay for the ride. ",Human
4ntkig,"I didn't answer because I felt that it wasn't something realistic. What charges are we talking about? Unless OP refilled her tank with gas, there isn't any real way for a charge to be determined. If OP bought gas, then sure, she should pay for it. But if we're talking about some type of service charge for the drive home, I don't see how such a thing could be determined unless they both came to some decision. ",Human
4ntkig,"How about 2 cab rides from the owner's house to the car? That's one to get home and one to come pick it up in the morning. I agree with you that it would be a pretty silly and unreasonable thing for him to ask for. Indeed, it would make him a right asshole. But I'm of the same mind with her charging him for something that was out of his control and only happened because she was irresponsible. If he was driving for his own reasons and she was doing him a favour then he absolutely should pay. No question about it. But that's not at all what happened. I feel like you and some others here are looking at the event without taking into account the context. 

Would you honestly make someone pay, even half, for damages in this scenario? If my friend was driving me home because I was too drunk to drive my own car and an animal jumped in front of the car I would not for a second consider them liable. If I was OP I would be really pissed at my friend for even considering it. ",Human
4ntkig,"Like I said, the situation really sucks. I sympathize with the OP here. But if you want to get really deep into it, I do think that the Op shares at least a little responsibility. They were with their friend when she got drunk, and they didn't stop her from getting so. OP's fault? Not necessarily. But they let her get drunk, and chose to drive a car that doesn't belong to them home instead of getting a cab, and then had an accident that was out of their control. I understand they couldn't help it, and I understand that it sucks, but the OP is at least partially to blame here. Even if they had absolutely no way to avoid the accident, I think that if they messed up another person's car while driving it then they are at least partially responsible. ",Human
4ntkig,"That makes sense. I do think the right thing to do is to split the costs. OP did in fact have to drive his drunk friend, but if he'd hit the thing in his car he'd be covering costs. I do still think the person driving holds at least some responsibility and flat out refusing to help pay is not cool.",Human
4ntkig,"I'm feeling this side of the argument more and more, however I do still think refusing *any* responsibility for this is a dick move. I would pay for half and take some responsibility for my part in what happened if it were me. Shit happens on the road and sometimes you end up having to pay for it. 

I've also learned over the years which of my friends are more likely to end up drunk and I insist on taking my own car to parties, if I were OP, I wouldn't have let myself end up out somewhere with a drunk friend without my own vehicle. I do think that because he was driving he holds some responsibility, but you're right that it isn't as black and white as I initially saw this. You do accept some liability when you get behind the wheel. ",Human
4ntkig,"I definitely agree about having the foresight to avoid the situation entirely. I'd probably have just called a cab for her. At the same time, she should've taken a cab there in the first place if she knew she was getting drunk. I guess it's fair that they both take part of the blame for a number of bad decisions on each end. 

This is why I don't go out. ",Human
4ntkig,"I'd agree with this post. If you want to be extra reasonable, offer to pay for some of the damages. Point out that statistically, there's a pretty good chance you saved her a lot more money as you (potentially) helped her avoid a drunk driving charge, plus the greater damage she could have caused driving drunk.",Human
4ntkig,"Then no man, you're good! You made sure everyone came home safe. Just a shame about the raccoon, but honestly, what a freak accident. What can you do about that?

You should feel good for ending the night safely, not made to feel bad by a friend who totally screwed you over by getting pissed. That is assholish. ",Human
4ntkig,"I think if you were borrowing her car in a separate situation it would be on you to pay, but under the circumstances, I think you could argue she forced you to borrow the car by driving you somewhere and then compromising her ability to take you back.

I think if we look at it like that, it's pretty cut and dry.",Human
4ntkig,"I need more information.  Did you know your friend was going to drink?  Was it already decided that you would be driving home before your friend started drinking?  Have you ever done this before spontaneously?   From what I know so far it sounds you should split it.  If you took it upon yourself to get you and your friend home when you could have stayed over or taken an uber home then you better pony up.  If your friend got drunk when they said they would be sober to drive home then they should pony up.  As it stands  it sounds like you should split the deductible or the entire cost, whatever is cheaper.",Human
4ntkig,There's not enough info here yet.  We don't know if it was his decision alone to drive home or if the friend was planning to drive home then got hammered which forced this guy to drive.,Human
4ntkig,"Seems obvious, but you're sure she doesn't have insurance coverage for this?",Human
4ntsf0,"You were incredibly generous and very clear with what you needed from her. Not the asshole.

4ntsf0,"Not the asshole. She sounds like one of those people that doesn't actually do anything to help themselves, especially since she was supposed to move out from her mother's and never found a place.

If you wanted you could text or call asking how the search for a new place has been going. Otherwise if she's the type to leave passive aggressive posts and talking at work about how awkward it will be for you to get back, it might be easier to focus on work and be content that you helped her out when you could and it's time for her to help herself.",Human

",Human
4ntsf0,"I understand the fear of inviting her back. You should probably keep if it simple then, over text. Text a simple hey, I haven't heard from you since we got back. I hope you were able to find a place! Or alternatively text, hey how is the search for a new place going?

You mentioned that you had gathered house supplies for her. Do you still have these? A good way to go about the message then would be to say hey, I'm hoping you have a new place! We'd like to reconnect and bring you housewarming gifts! (Problem with this one though is that if you know she doesn't have a new place and act ignorant she might get upset)

Real talk though, if the idea of reaching out to her and the fear of accidentally inviting her back is a big cause of stress, then it wouldn't make you the asshole to not reach out. Like you indicated in your post, if she needs help she knows that you will help. If she chooses to ignore that and cause drama, that's on her.

I feel like if she comes back it's going to be harder to get her to move on. There are multiple others who have sent her info on places and she hasn't moved forward as far as I know. I just don't know how to essentially say ""hey I hope you found a place. Let me know when you are ready for this stuff. I still want you to have it, but i really don't want to deal with the drama of you being here all the time, but I wish you",Human
4ntsf0,Thank you for saying so. I am sure part of it is being socially awkward and not really understanding where normal people draw boundaries. ,Human
4ntsf0,"In this instance you seem like the normal person. Maybe a little over thinking, but in no way the asshole. ",Human
4nulm9,"No dude, fuck that. Once he takes your shift, he's responsible for it. Regardless of what else he has going on. There's no harm in ASKING you to take it back, but he's in no position to make demands of you. If you say no, then he needs to start looking around for someone else to take that shift. If he can't, well, tough shit for him.",Human
4nulm9,"He's the asshole. 

If it has been switched on the schedule then it's his and you don't need to take it. However, if it wasn't switched on the schedule then technically you're responsible for it and have to work it. That would be a management perspective. He's an asshole either way. Enjoy your night off.",Human
4nulm9,I bet if he asked nicely and made it up to you there wouldn't be a problem.  It's his entitles attitude that makes him the asshole here. ,Human
4nulm9,"Once he takes the shift he is responsible. If neither of you show up, it will be him who gets in shit for it.

How I know: A friend pulled a stunt like that and got fired.",Human
4nulm9,He told your BOSS to tell you that he wasn't talking to you anymore? How old is this guy? He sounds like a whiny child.,Human
4nulm9,"Nah, you're good. At my old job, we had forms that had to be filled out if you needed coverage. So basically you'd fill out that you need this day and time off and if someone can take it they will sign it.

I don't know if you already have something like this but if you did you should have wrote one up and had him sign it so that it is now on paper that the shift is his responsibility. 

I still think hes wrong, but I've learned to get as much as you can documented on paper or through email so that things are never your word vs theirs.",Human
4nulm9,"wow... your friend is a colossal asshole.  He takes your shift, then turns around last minute, and takes a temper tantrum because he decides he doesn't want to work it?  What a douche.",Human
4nulm9,Fuuuckk nooo you're not.,Human
4nwbjq,"Your friend is the asshole for placing a $225 charge on everyone's shoulders without consulting the group. I would explain to the friend who booked it that you wish you had been consulted beforehand, but $225 for a limo is simply not doable for you right now, and unfortunately you'll have to skip out on the evening. If others in the group give you shit about it, tell them the same thing. It's ridiculous to expect your friends to pay $200+ with no warning.

ETA: Before you withdraw completely, ask your friend if it's possible to downsize the limo. That might lower the cost considerably. If not, refer to the above.",Human
4nwbjq,"I feel the same way. The city is also extremely easy to get to. I spend nearly $500 on a monthly commuter pass and I think the train would be a much more practical form of transportation.

Do you think I should reply all to the email and state my case? Or should I just speak to the person who booked it separately?",Human
4nwbjq,"Email the person who booked it, and tell them $225 is not something you can afford. Ask if the size of the limo can be changed in order to lower the cost, or if some cheaper alternative of transportation can be found. If the reservation is final, or if the price is still too high for you, let him know that unfortunately, you'll have to skip out due to budget constraints. Then reply all to the group and say the same thing, and wish them a good evening out.

That's what I would do.",Human
4nwbjq,"Thanks for the advice. I really don't want to miss out on the party. I just want to avoid taking the limo. Do you think it's an all or nothing situation? Like no limo, no party?",Human
4nwbjq,"Well, it depends on a lot of variables. If the limo can't be canceled, and you'll be charged anyway, it makes sense for the group to take it to avoid losing money. If you can get out of the contract, I think something alternative could be found. You mentioned a train, or you could take multiple Ubers, for instance. 

It also depends on how everyone else feels. If everyone had their hearts set on a limo, it's going to be hard to convince them to change their plans.",Human
4nwbjq,"There's no way in hell you're the asshole in this situation. The guy made it your responsibility to throw $250 at a limo ride that was never even discussed. Like the person above said, let him know that $250 is a little too much to contribute at the time and see if it can be downsized. I'm sure you don't wanna miss out on the trip and I hope you manage to go but don't feel like the asshole if it doesn't go that way. ",Human
4nwbjq,Where do you live that a train pass is 500??,Human
4nwbjq,"It's $460 a month on the metro north from Beacon, NY to NYC",Human
4nwbjq,Thats crazy. ,Human
4nwbjq,"Just talk to the guy that booked it before getting too upset. If he has a lot of $, he may not have even thought about it, which still makes him an asshole, but when it's pointed out he may realize it / work it out with you. 

If he can't afford it without everyone else pitching in, and you can't afford it, then just offer to meet them at one of the destinations. Nothing wrong with that, but don't get in the limo.",Human
4nwbjq,"Holy christ, that's $2700 for the night.  Now, it might not be bad in NYC, but for the hell of it, call a couple limo companies, and get a price.  If he is over charging you (and i have a feeling in the back of my mind), it rases the bar quite a bit.  However, yes, he is an asshole for not talking about it to anyone first.",Human
4nwbjq,I don't know if that's a good price or bad :/ it's more expensive in London but I've seen cheaper in other countries.,Human
4nwbjq,"He's a cock for not asking people beforehand. You'd be super cool for paying up anyway but if you're making ends meet, I think you're fine blowing it off nicely.",Human
4nwbjq,maybe to get to work,Human
4nwbjq,"Im in a city no where near like new york. Parking here can still run you 18-30 bucks a day downtown. Even if he had a vehicle, at that point it makes more sense to just take the train anyway.

(And here, parking near the train is free and plentiful- so people drive to the train, and then train to work. Cheaper, quicker, easier)",Human
4nwbjq,Do you live in Texas? Cause owning a car in NYC is a different story altogether.  ,Human
4nwbjq,"No shit, I could fly myself and 4 friends around Denver in a helicopter for a few hours for that much,  and still have $200 left over. ",Human
4nwbjq,"i figured 12 x $225 ... that is a lot.  i could see $1200 for a limo or so, but not that much",Human
4nwbjq,"I'm just stunned, I think party Limos are like rolling hotel rooms, and little gross, so the last time I was interested was high school prom.  It was like $400 for a limo all night, we rented an astro van and buddy brother in law drove us around.  No rules, and it cost us $60.  For a different friend's bachelor party we rented a uhaul truck and stuck old couches and camping lamps in the back.  ",Human
4nwbjq,"yup, while it is new york city, and you expect it to be more... that is still a little too much.  I would say op is not only NOT the asshole, but someone is trying to give him the shaft.",Human
4nwbjq,"Please go on. Other than parking and traffic, what else factors in? I'm genuinely curious.",Human
4nwbjq,"Definitely not the asshole. I think you would kinda be the asshole if you decided not to go, therefore putting the costs onto the others in the group for the limo. But try to work out a solution first, for example there are most definitely airbnb's that can sleep 9 people that cost $500 a night in NYC. That way you guys don't need a limo to take you to and from home, if you just stay the night in the city and use the subway or taxis to get around if needed. That amount per person is almost suspiciously high and I would definitely talk to the groom about it and see what the alternatives are. 
Edit: here's an example of an Airbnb that could sleep 12, $468 per night 
https://airbnb.com/rooms/11257690?s=8&amp;user_id=25017695&amp;ref_device_id=5d3ab6f8856ee0491b8811f6935ea87dcb2c1c88",Human
4nwbjq,"You hit the nail on the head pretty much, And its not just limited parking its expensive, like $30-50 a day in some parts of the city. Also toll roads and bridges.  And really it's all unneccessary expense, because there are so many other ways to get around the city. And so much of the city is walkable.  You can find almost anything you need within a half mile or so of most places.  ",Human
4nwbjq,"Cool, thanks for the reply!",Human
4nwbjq,It's crossed my mind that he might be overcharging us. I have doubts about his integrity. I think I might ask to see the invoice before I make a decision.,Human
4nwbjq,"Be careful! I would think the limo itself would have a set price rather than it being per person, meaning that the limo would be 9*255=2295 and that if there were 12 people it would be a little under $200 each. When you're getting estimates from other places, work from this number, not 12*255 or you'll end up mad at someone who may not be dishonest. ",Human
4nwbjq,"I would think the limo itself would have a set price rather than it being per person, meaning that the limo would be 9*255=2295. Do you have experience that indicates to you that limo charges are usually per person rather than per limo? ",Human
4nwbjq,"it's usually per limo.  sometimes, they make allowances on the number of guests.  Call up, and see what one would cost to book to see if your getting hosed.  try a few different places.",Human
4nwbjq,"asking to see the invoice, will most likely make you the asshole.  Just call up a few different limo places, and see what they would charge to do this.  That way your friend doesn't know the difference if he is giving you the old in-out.",Human
4nwbjq,I wouldn't expect my friend to pay 50 dollars without consulting him first. That's ridiculous.,Human
4nwbjq,"Exactly. I mentioned it to another friend of mine and he said ""It's still way cheaper than if we went to Atlantic City.""

I said, that's not the point. I don't care if it's $225 or $2.25, you don't just book without asking. I'm still furious about the whole thing.",Human
4o4thj,"Not the asshole.

Gifts are a touchy spot, but I don't think you're the asshole here, but, I don't think he is *much* of an asshole either for feeling a little hurt, though he *did* buy the wrong item.

4o4thj,"Yeah I don't think youre the asshole here. 

People leave receipts in gifts for a reason? If they don't want you to return a gift, then they shouldn't leave a receipt with it. ",Human
4o4thj,"Yeah, I really never meant for this to be a ""Which of us is wrong"" post. I was sort of just wondering if my actions were that of an asshole.
He clearly did nothing wrong for being disappointed.",Human
4o4thj,That is a fantastic and mature attitude about the whole thing. Props.,Human
4o4thj,"Not the asshole here. By your own words, your uncle included the receipt which to me means he had to have at least had an idea that you might rather have another pair. It's unfortunate that he got upset but also understandable. I learned at a pretty young age to never as for specific models of important things. Just ask for cash or socks. Get the cool stuff for yourself because then this situation will never happen again. ",Human
4o4thj,"You're definitely not the asshole here, even though it would have been nicer if you had talked to him before returning them. I am sure he would have understood if you had told him you're thankful for the gift but still want to return it to buy the ones you really want. ",Human

Uncle asked you what you wanted.

Uncle included the receipt.  

",Human
4o4thj,"I don't think you are the asshole here.

However, if you have a very specific preference for a product, it really is best not to suggest that friends and family purchase that product for you, due to the likelihood of stuff like this happening. 

Either suggest something completely different or say something like ""I'd love to get some headphones but I'm really picky about the make and model. It would be great if you'd get me a gift card for Awesome Headphone Store.""",Human
4o4thj,Not the asshole. Victim of circumstance. I would talk it over with your uncle though.,Human
4o4thj,"Yesss, gift cards are the way! For some people they can also be way less stressful than actually going out and finding a specific gift.",Human
4o4thj,"You are not an assshole and neither is he. His somber response of disappointment isn't on you. He cared enough to actually ask someone else for help to get what he thought you wanted, but still knew it might not be right so he gave you the receipt with the purchase. The look of disappointment was more on the circumstance because he obviously cared about getting you something you wanted. You are lucky to have an Uncle like that. You are not wrong for returning it but make sure you show him some appreciation anyway as you can clearly recognize he cared about getting you what you wanted and tried enough to ask for help about a subject he was in over his head about. ",Human
4o4thj,"Just for the record, I never intended this to be a ""Who is in the wrong?"" question. I was just concerned about my own actions. He's obviously done nothing wrong by being disappointed.",Human

4o4thj,"I don't think there is an asshole here. Leaving the receipt in the gift certainly implies returning it is fine, but even so, I can understand your uncle being disappointed that he got the gift wrong.

Just let him know you're grateful that he tried, and that you wouldn't have been able to afford the right ones without the money from returning them? That might make him feel better.",Human
4o4thj,"Not the asshole. He knew he wasn't getting what you asked for. And like you said, leaving the receipt in the wrapping seems like him giving you permission to return it. I feel for your uncle, but I don't think you did anything bad yourself. Just a bad situation. ",Human
4o4thj,"No. If you knew they would likely be at the specific local shop, I would've at least told him that though. ",Human

You want her money you get her rules. You can reject both but not one.",Human
4o5a1o,"Not the asshole at all, my friend! You're growing up and part of growing up is living on your own. Your family doesn't have any right to be angry at you for wanting your own space.

4o5a1o,"So if he qualifies for nothing that's a pretty big indication that the household makes plenty, no? And in terms of the cost of tuition (ignoring board entirely) when a family member works for the university? I work for one in a major conference and my offspring get ZERO benefit. ",Human

Let's say your doctor recommends that since you have lung cancer, you should quit smoking the first second you can.  Would you feel like that is a dick move?  This is the same situation.  The only difference is you call the cancer mom.  

Who cares what other people may or may not think?  Would you rather be happy in your own environment, and not have to hear their thoughts about your life?  Or would you rather be sad in your mom's house and have her constantly remind you of the power she has over you.

There will also be a surge charge after the concert for Uber I bet. ",Human
4o6hj3,"Everyone's the asshole here. 

What I don't understand is why you don't want to put it on your card. Uber is an official company, and they just need a card because their payments are done online. If they're going to pay you, then what's the big deal?

The girl especially is an asshole for exposing a conversation outside of the group conversation. That's just rude. 

All in all, you are all kids, and this kid bullshit. All of you stop being pricks.  ",Human

Simple problem. Simple fix. ",Human
4o6hj3,"Seems like everyone is an asshole here.   The uber thing is not a big deal, they aren't expensive and the cost is getting split six ways.  Not sure why they want you to go if you don't have a ticket for the show unless it is only to use you for your access to an uber.  ",Human
4o6hj3,"An Uber XL is around $2/mile in many places, and the ride is two hours. Even if it's only 200 miles r/t, it's gonna be around $70 per person. Not super expensive, but definitely not cheap for a bunch of high schoolers. ",Human
4o6hj3,"From what you've said so far, I would say you're not an asshole. There's nothing wrong with being careful with your money (Especially because Uber costs can vary, what happens if it costs more than you expected and it drains your account? Can you trust you friends to pay you for the rest of it?) .. 

As far as a solution.. if you *really* don't want to go, and if it works with what your friends know about you, you could tell them that you have a special childrens debit account and your parents put a lock on it where you can only use it for food and clothes.

An important question I must ask though, is whether your friends plan on hanging out with you at the park before the concert, or are they basically just bringing you along so you can hang by yourself for a couple of hours while they go to the concert? I can't make a judgement on your friends",Human
4o6hj3,"Wait, they already purchased tickets without knowing how they were going to get there? These are the same people that want you to trust them that they will have enough money to cover a 2 hour Uber ride that nobody knows how much it will be both there and back.

For that you are not the asshole, but, it is kinda of assholish to throw in that you'd have to take time out of your life to get the money and deposit it in the bank. That's the kind of things friends don't bitch about. ",Human
4o6hj3,"Why aren't any of you asking for your parents to pay for the Uber, and then later the parent divides the sum in six ways and everyone pays for it? I think it's kind of silly to hope that one of you will have enough money on the card to pay for the whole trip. 

I don't think you are an asshole, it is completely fine to say no to things that would only be an inconvenience to you. I mean they are all going because they want to see a concert, which you won't go to see, so I bet your motivation to go is way smaller than theirs, so it makes sense that they should be the ones planning the trip better and not just putting all the responsibility on to you. You aren't their parent, you don't need to fix shit for them to be able to see a concert. ",Human

It really sounds like they don't even care for your company, just need you to tag along for their convenience.",Human
4o6hj3,"You're not the asshole. They failed to preplan how to get to this concert and bought tickets anyway. Also, they expect you to just wait around for them on your own, and THEN expect you to pay for an Uber ride basically on the premise of ""We'll pay you back"". I would've said no as well.

Also, Dana is even more of an asshole for screenshotting a private chat simply to drop you in the shit.",Human
4o6hj3,"They *say* they're going to pay her. You know the phrase never lend money you wouldn't give away? She'll probably get some of it back, but inevitably, someone won't pay, it'll cost more than they expect, or someone will do something that will cost her more. ",Human
4o6hj3,"You do this now and the group is going to designate you as the babysitter/wingman/designated driver. These also dont sound like friends, but aquaintences.  You dont want to go, so dont. Fuck the pass, just dont buy one next time.",Human
4o6hj3,You're not the asshole. Your friends are major assholes. Why would they purchase tickets to a concert before even having the means to get there? And were you not asked to go to the concert? If not then they've got some nerve to not invite you to go to the concert but expect you to be their means of paying for an uber. And then they act like jerks regarding that private message. If I were you I wouldn't even go. They don't deserve your company if you ask me.,Human
4o6hj3,"You're an asshole but don't worry so is everyone else in this situation. You're all asshole.

Dana's an asshole for fucking you over with your privacy. 

Everyone else is an asshole for having zero planning skills and feeling entitled for you to fix their plans.

And you're an asshole for thinking helping your friends out is too much effort if you truthfully are the only one with the means of fixing this situation for them.

If you are all from middle income families and you are worried about bouncing why can't a parent put the card down. Use uber to figure out how much it is then you all pay that parent they didn't let you use their uber or order it for you. You can figure out the assumed Max cost double that. Then everyone pay a parent who's organising this. If it's surge pricing it'll be easier for a parent to absorb the cost more likely others will pay you back.

Don't take this the wrong way, but your story gave the impression of wanting validation rather than a genuine answer.

i have suggested various people he could live with. one even offered to take over my lease, but he severely antagonized him... when he crawled back to this person asking if they can please room together, the other person of course said no.

I've had both options on various occasions and can honestly say I think each time, the other particpant's response and conversation has given insight into the nature of the relationship currently, and where both of us wished it would go. When friends have blown up or irrationally thrown passive aggressive or defensive comments around, deflecting blame or trying to become the victim of a no-fault situation, I can see that it's beyond what's worth working for, on my end. When they respond in a (mostly) level, or logical way, and express some sort of thoughts behind why things are this way, or how they can improve, I can see that we both care about the friendship/familial bond and that bond is stronger for it. Hope that helps. I found that's what works for me, since giving it that honest shot essentially let's them choose which way they want it to go, and allows me to feel that I've given it my best effort.

4obf97,"I don't think you're an asshole, but you'll have to make a compromise: Since he's not able to pay (or at least it would be very difficult, judging from your story), demanding 400$ (and possibly arranging he can pay it in terms) would probably destroy your friendship. You have all the right to claim the full 400$, but since that would be really hard on your friend it can be expected that he doesn't see you as a friend as much or at all after that. 

From your side, all you demand is compensation for the damage he did.

From his side, you demand something he simply cannot or has a serious lot of trouble with to provide. 

So you'll either have to choose or try to make a compromise. Doesn't mean you're an asshole if you choose to demand the money, but you might be viewed by your friend as one none the less.

Personally, if it's more an acquaintance than a friend I'd keep demanding. If it's a really good friend and I know he wouldn't able to pay, I would probably try to split it in such way that you get as much money back as possible, but it's still doable for him to actually pay up.",Human

You're insisting that someone pay for minimal damage that you've said yourself isn't noticeable- I understand that may be important to you, but your friend who probably had no idea it was even there until you showed him is going to think you're an asshole. He's an asshole for tearing your car up, but you're kind of an asshole in that respect. Not as big of an asshole as he is, but slightly. 400$ for a small scratch is kind of insane. If the dent is out, I would consider it fixed. If any normal person (not obsessed with your car) can look at it and say ""hey that's nice"" then you should drop the issue.

I live in a little town that's very boring but there's three bars within a half a mile (or .8 kilometers) of my house that have pool tables.  So I wonder what you guys did before you found the pool table.

4og510,"I don't think you're an asshole, but I think you're being needlessly inflexible and damaging your friendship as a result. 

I don't think you should have to quit going to the bar to play pool, but you should be willing to compromise and do what your friend wants every once in a while. Though I'm sure you feel like his gf is getting between you guys, I can't blame her for not wanting to go watch you play pool. Besides, the reason he wants to do something else is irrelevant. Sometimes friends end up having some diverging interests, and compromises need to be made occasionally. One of my friends likes going to loud country bars, and I occasionally go with her despite hating that environment. Another friend goes to concerts I like with me, so I go to concerts she likes with her.

Again, there's no reason you should stop playing pool, but there's also no reason to insist that's the only option.

It made me reconsider complimenting appearances at all, but instead complimenting positive life changes.  If you're not sure which is in play, keep comments to yourself.

Also, after the first few times a particular person says something about an appearance change, regardless of its reason, the unspoken message seems to become ""wow, I can't believe how much you've changed from the fat slob you used to be,"" and ""your value to me is the way you decorate my world, and nothing more.""

Also a side note:  20-some years ago while pregnant with my youngest, I found out my mother was dying.  It was something I only shared with people close to me.  I lost my baby weight within 2-3 weeks of having him.  Casual acquaintances would compliment me on it, like ""Wow, I can't believe you had a baby a couple weeks ago.  What's your secret?""

I agree with you though, I've been losing weight recently through diet and exercise and it's really hard, I've lots 40 pounds and I don't see any difference. It encourages me when people comment on my weight loss, let's me know that it's making a difference.

That story reminds me of when people of colour find the question ""Where are you from?"" offensive.  My parents are from Africa, but I was born and raised in Australia, and until I started university and part time work, I was never bothered by that question, since I went to a school that was overwhelmingly made up of immigrants/children of immigrants and never heard it.  But then when I started getting the question every day at work and every time I met a new person at uni, it got to be very annoying fast.  Like, why do all these people immediately assume I'm not Australian?  Why am I being treated like an outsider?

The point I'm trying to make is that an initially benign question or comment might seem that way to an outsider, but you always have to put yourself in the other person's shoes and think about what they've gone through, as well as not trivialise their emotions by finding it silly that they're offended by something.",Human

4ovf8a,"You're not an asshole but I need to tell you something from experience of owning 2 e30's in my life, they require a lot of work to make them reliable and safe. I currently daily drive an early model with an m30 swap.

First and foremost I don't care how good the deal seems you will chase vacuum leaks, idle control valve cleaning, afm failures, throttle body cleaning, cooling issues, spark maybe, fuel pump failures, fuel filters, fuel pump relays, cooling issues, heater core replacement, control arm bushings, ball joint failures, rear strut tower failure, rear trailing arm bushing failure, rear sub frame bushing failure, driveshaft linkage failure, guibo failure, shifter bushing replacement... and that's all the easy stuff. Let alone low compression, blown head gasket, steering rack leaks, full shock replacement, wheel bearings, interior torn to shit... 

if you let these things go you will encounter cascading failures.

Expect a lot of time on jack stands if you intend to save money by doing the work yourself. You should be very handy with wrenches and will need a few specialty tools for some of that work. If you're price for this car is landing in the middle of the market or closer to the higher side expect to have some of those items above taken care of but not all.

Now with all that said the e30 is often proclaimed as God's chariot by fans and enthusiasts thanks to the handling and fun factor along with this chassis being one of the winningest m3's in history. It's always",Human

But fuck whatever your gf says it's your money ",Human
4ovf8a,"I totally understand what you're saying about problems but this car has had lots of work to bring it back to original standard, it's had no problems for the last 20k miles or so because the guy who I'm buying it off has made sure of it. I know the guy and I trust him, he's even had a full rebuild of the diff and and a full over haul of the rear breaks and suspension. If there are problems I'm willing to get my hands dirty and fix it, that's probably one of the main reasons I bought the car because I want to be able to fix it myself.

It's not full of unfixable electronics, and parts are widely available, including from breakers.

It is a shitty  thing to do and is stealing.  And before people say it was a small amount, that is not the point.

What actually happened was, some weeks later, I felt guilty enough to offer up the money. In math class I offered it to him, and somehow he found his morals and finally fessed up. If I hadn't made the gesture, he would've just kept they money and stayed silent. Definitely the asshole. Secondly, I did not 'let' him keep it.

4p33fj,"I don't think you're the asshole. I think you're just in an uncomfortable position. You asked for a quote, and never got one. Instead you got a bill.

Did your friend know you were 'doing him a favor' by lending him the clarinet to practice on? Or did he think you needed a repair, and since he was in school for that sort of thing, you turned to him?

Have you ever had your clarinet repaired before / did you have any idea what a clarinet repair would cost? If you have, and knew it would range several hundred dollars, but only expected that you'd have to pay $100 or so, then maybe you're the asshole. 

",Human
4p33fj,You both can share the blame of being an asshole for not communicating better at the beginning about what your desired end state is.  ,Human
4p33fj,"So... if I am reading this correctly, when you requested a receipt, he didn't want to give you one, and decided he would give it to you free of charge?  With an admission that the work was not completed?

I'm not sure if we have all the information, but I think I am going to have to go with not the asshole here. It sounds like your friend knows he didn't do $900 worth of work, and probably not $300 either. If he was confident in the work he had done, a detailed description of what work was completed shouldn't be an issue.

 Also, you made it clear that you were willing to pay for supplies, so you should cover that. Since he would have been working on an instrument anyway because of the class, and you never discussed any compensation for his labor, I don't see why he would expect you to pay for labor. ",Human
4p33fj,"He tried to charge you an outrageous amount out of the blue and then caved when confronted about it.  Avoid doing any business (including rooming) with this guy.  If he ever needs you to spot him some money, don't expect it back.

Since the clarinet isn't something you needed back, I would just tell him to keep it so there's no question of liability.  Be very clear and in writing that you gave it to him to practice on and don't want it back.  He'll sell it, probably for cash to waste.

Not the asshole.",Human
4p33fj,"I don't think that you are the asshole, but I don't know if he is or not.  It is a little suspicious that he won't give you a receipt back for the work he has done, just for your informational purposes, but there is gray area here.

I think you learned a valuable lesson that you need to make extra sure you are clear on how much you are willing to pay for a job before the job is done.  Never assume that because you are friends that money things will work out okay.  That is a great way to drive a wedge in a friendship, both people think that the other should give a little more because of friendship, instead of just spelling out exactly what will be done.   

He needs to know this if he is going to be a professional too.  If someone asks for a quote, give them a quote before you do the work.

",Human
4p33fj,"The way you tell the story, it sounds like you GAVE him the clarinet to keep and wasn't expecting it back.  If this is the case you obviously did not communicate that to him or not very well.  If this is not the case you certainly didn't communicate that very well here.  

**YOU**  approached **HIM** so it's YOUR responsibility to communicate what you expected.  Look at it from his angle. I went to school to learn a trade.  (fixing instruments) My friend gives me his broken clarinet to fix, I honestly forgot about it but saw his emails asking about it so I figured how much it would cost to fix and gave him a figure 1/3 of what it would cost in the real world.  Now he thinks I'm trying to rip him off.  He obviously doesn't know what the actual cost of the repair would be so I'm just going to return the partially fixed instrument for no cost, just to save our friendship.

**YOU'RE the asshole for initial poor communication.**",Human
4p33fj,"Not the asshole. If yo were going to pay him, this should have been understood in the beginning. If I were you, I'd do the ""nice"" thing and pay him, but I don't blame you for not wanting to. ",Human
4p33fj,"I think we need more information about the initial passing of the clarinet to your friend, specifically how that exchange went down. Was the gist/vibe/impression after that occured?",Human
4p33fj,"&gt;My friend and I are both musicians.

Musicians that don't pay. Am I the only one who sees the irony?",Human
4p33fj,"You're not the asshole.  A quick Google search suggests a professional pad replacement for a clarinet runs about $125 to $175 on average.  A complete professional overhaul is more around $300 -- and again, that's a professional rate.  I can't find anything that would cost around $900, TBH.

You're not the asshole for asking for a receipt.  If he was on the up-and-up, he would have been able to provide one.  It sounds to me like he knows he was overcharging you and was afraid to getting called out on it, so he just dropped it altogether.",Human

4p8ggs,Nope. Fuck Nana. ,Human

Being a good friend to someone means being supportive and understanding that even though I don't like that person, my friend still does and i should not make that impossibly difficult for them.

All that said, it sounds like Nana is telling you in so many words that she is incapable of acting civilly. I would place the onus on her and say, ""My party is for all of my friends, dude. You, Bean, and everybody else are still my friends. I want you to come but you gotta respect that im still cool with Bean and that means being cool. If you can't be cool, then maybe you should dip before Bean arrives.""",Human

Bringing up who's paying for dinner is really a classless move and obviously shows where your mom's priorities are.  I have news you're not going to like.  You put yourself in this situation.

If the answer is that you would rather grow apart and move on if she won't change, then it's time to have the conversation about how you care about her but feel as though your friendship is not equal for both of you.  The format: ""when you do x, it makes me feel y"" is a godsend in tough conversations, because it can't dissolve into an argument.  It's not implying you know how she feels.

Maybe there is something deeper going on here. Does he play all day too? Or is he asleep all day? ",Human

As someone with insomnia, and irregular sleeping patterns it may actually be more difficult for him to change than it is for you to not be upset by. ",Human

He does play all day too, he's on his computer probably 12-14 hours a day. And that's a whole other issue that I won't even go into haha",Human

4po9sj,"You're not an asshole for wanting someone who is on a similar schedule, but he's not an asshole for not being that person. He is not an asshole, just immature, if he's promising something that he won't or can't deliver on though.

I would still take the time to think through why this is so important to you though, because being upset enough to literally lose sleep over it doesn't seem proportional, in general. I'm guessing that you're actually more upset because you feel like you're pulling most of the weight in the household.

BTW, I go to sleep around 9pm and my husband will often be up until 2am. He literally cannot fall asleep earlier, but you wouldn't think so because he's up watching movies or reading. We have a ritual in which he ""tucks me in"" every night, basically just 5-10 minutes of us lying there together and decompressing. I kiss him goodbye and tell him I love him when I'm out the door by 6am most mornings; most of the time he wakes up just enough to say he loves me back.

That much time in a game is super unhealthy. What part of life is he avoiding? I was avoiding all of it myself. Twelve hours in video games a day was a symptom of depression for me. 

He needs to change this. This is a problem that he might need a therapist for. You are not the asshole. This is unhealthy behavior from him.",Human

Yah, see, that *is* the issue. Going to bed late is just a symptom of his addiction. 12-14 hours a day is not a healthy amount of time to spend on the computer. It's physically unhealthy, emotionally unhealthy, and apparently causing relationship issues. And he doesn't work? Are you taking care of him financially? It sounds like he's depressed and in need of some therapy, or at the very least, a job.",Human

The bigger issue to me is that spending that much time gaming has got to be hurting your relationship.

4po9sj,"I'd rather think you and I are both real smart, but you do have a point.",Human

Is there anything you can do to coax him outside on the weekends? A cool hike? Maybe plan a camping trip or something? Or a short little vacation somewhere? Something fun that can get him away and disconnected for awhile. Plus, it'll get him back into bed with you.

",Human
4po9sj,I'm sure both can be true.,Human
4po9sj,Well currently he's doing core classes which are pretty easy so that's how he's doing well in school. But yes I agree that he might have something wrong mentally. Or physically.,Human
4po9sj,"I know it's not healthy, and I've tried to get him to understand that but he just wants to do what he wants, which is play on the computer. He does go out with me to dinner or movies a couple times a week so he's not completely hopeless ;)",Human
4po9sj,"This was literally on the list of Cons I made before leaving my ex.

",Human
4po9sj,"Well really the root of my issue with it is that I work full time, so most of the time we get to spend together is in the evening; including bed time. So the fact that he won't go to bed with me, when we only get basically 4 hours a day together that I'm not at work or sleeping, because of the computer that he can be on all day while I'm at work, is offensive to me. When he spends my 10 hours at work on the computer, I don't get why it's not possible to spend 4 hours in the evening with me. It's disproportionate is the problem.


Some nights if he knows he's going to stay up way later than me he'll come to bed with me for half an hour and watch an episode of something with me and then go back downstairs which is great. But a lot of the time he'll say he'll ""be up soon"" and then 6 hours later he's still at the computer...",Human
4po9sj,Why are you two even dating? It sounds like you barely have a relationship.,Human
4po9sj,"Neither of you are assholes.

I have trouble going to sleep unless it's stupid late as well. I've gotten better over the past couple years (2am now) but I used to be like this dude. There's a chance he should put in more effort to connect with you, but it's more likely a problem that people don't generally understand. I can personally attest that this isn't something you just go ahead and fix with willpower. It's like telling an obese person ""just get your shit together and lose weight"". Or a depressed person ""get your shit together, get out of bed, come on"".

It's good he admits it's a problem. Whenever my partner brings it up, I admit that it's a problem that I'm trying to work on. Nobody is perfect, and we can all improve. I think I'm a really solid partner in other ways.

This might not be something you can shame or pressure him into fixing. You need to understand the problem better. With sleep it can be a million things... for me, if I feel I wasn't productive that day I will stay up very late doing pointless shit. I also grew up with a crazy mom and being on a computer late at night was the only way to avoid her regularly.",Human

4po9sj,"Your boyfriend has a gaming addiction, plain and simple.",Human
4po9sj,"Either way this is a health problem that he should probably seek help for. You need to take this as seriously as any other addiction. 12-14 hours gaming, staying up late, it's not only not healthy, it's extreme. He has access to help as a veteran and he needs to fill out the forms and jump through the hoops to get that help. 

You've said that he knows this is a problem. He's not fixing it. You can't fix this either, it's over your pay grade. He needs to go talk to a mental health professional about this. ",Human
4po9sj,Nice straw man.,Human
4po9sj,"You are right to be annoyed he isn't fulfilling what he said he was.  However, it sounds like what you are looking for and requesting aren't the same thing.  Basically, you want to spend more time with him.  Sleeping at the same time is not spending more time together.  Ask him to not do gaming between when you get off and your bedtime.  That accomplishes your goal while still letting him stay up late.",Human
4po9sj,"Nobody here is the asshole, but the best advice I could give you would be to get into his hobby as well. Maybe you can only play his games for a few hours a night but just doing that will do much more for your relationship than being sad in bed. ",Human
4po9sj,"I get what you're saying, but why is it my responsibility to get into his hobby and not vice versa? I guess cause I'm the one who wants to spend more time with him, and not him with me? But then that's a whole other problem. Why should I want to spend time with someone who doesn't want to spend time with me",Human
4po9sj,Yeah getting someone to go to therapy for something they don't think is a problem doesn't seem like something I'm able to do. He's at the point where he would need a drastic wake up call to change his ways,Human
4po9sj,"I see what you're saying, but I actually prefer to eat dinner together, then have a couple hours to ourselves to do whatever, and then go to bed together versus a solid block together after work and then not going to bed together. And he knows this cause I've told him.",Human
4po9sj,"Well you didn't say what your hobby was. Maybe he does want to spend more time with you, or maybe he doesn't. If the latter is the case then perhaps the relationship is not going to work out. ",Human
4po9sj,"Yes, you are. You don't get to choose  when someone else goes to bed.

If he did the same with you wouldn't you get upset?",Human
4po9sj,"Similar situation.  Gamer boyfriend on zombie hours.  We've also established a tuck in ritual that is very sweet, and I get the closeness I want from that.  To be honest, I like the different schedules- he gets his alone time gaming after I go to bed, and I can get up on the weekends, workout and do brunch with girlfriends and come back before he's even up.  The key though is creating strong quality time when the two of you overlap.  I'd insist on that more then trying to guilt him into going to bed at your time.",Human
4po9sj,"I'm not ""choosing"" for him, I'm asking him to consider something I've asked him to do for me. 

But thank you for your opinion.",Human

4po9sj,"Then you know what you need to do to change this situation.

Or you can continue to live exactly as you are.

If he's not going to try to change, he *is* the asshole. 

I do not think your needs are being fulfilled by this relationship.",Human
4po9sj,"No one is the arsehole here.  He obviously loves his gaming and it seems like it is an important part of his life and has been for some time now.  You probably new this going in and should respect that, however he should be making more of an effort to respect your feelings and concerns over the matter.  I think communication is key and maybe you haven't communicated with him properly about it and he may not think its a big deal to you.  Obviously hits a big deal to you and he isn't putting in the effort so yeah.",Human
4po9sj,"You're not the asshole.

You have work. You deserve a full night's sleep without interruption at 4am. 

Perhaps you two can compromise. Why not get a cot or single bed for when your boyfriend is planning on gaming past 11pm to avoid him waking you up? 

If you need him to sleep at the same time as you (for emotional reasons), can he game late just on Fridays and Saturdays? I feel that since your boyfriend doesn't work, he should compromise more.",Human
4po9sj,"Yeah, no.


This is a serious issue. OP isn't enjoying a healthy relationship. OP is funding and taking care of a man-child.


The BF has most of his days free but spends 12-14hrs gaming instead of doing productive things (I'm all for gaming,but 12-14hrs is wildly unhealthy and must means that most other aspects of his life are being neglected). The BF refuses to correct a simple issue of wanting to spend time in bed with OP (figuratively saying ""I'd rather play games than spent time with you or be intimate with you""). The BF plays computer games for 12-14 hours a day, which, if you assume that he sleeps and eats, means that he can't possibly be contributing towards the chores much or at all.


And all this is waved off with placatory ""yeah, maybe I'll think about the possibility of considering working on it"" statements that clearly don't mean sweet diddly.


It's at least worth reconsidering the relationship and evaluating if that's the  life that OP wants. If so, winner winner for the BF and best wishes to OP.

She said she wouldn't see them if you weren't ok with it, so tell her that.  Have her refer your parents to a colleague so they don't have to find another therapist - hopefully someone in a different practice.

As a professional she cannot share the content of your therapy with other clients and vice versa, it doesn't sound like that's a legitimate concern here.

She's given you the choice, which is more than most would, and youre thinking of firing her because she had a consultation with a prospective client? You are the asshole.",Human

",Human
4q3j91,That doesn't make sense,Human
4q3j91,"Thank you very much for clarifying this. I guess the issue here is that my father disclosed some information about me to my now therapist before I ever saw her. It just strikes me that seeing my family is bankrupt of the fundamental element of trust that is necessary for good therapy. 

I don't want the little amount of a private life that I have away from my immediate family being accidentally compromised by my therapist. This would inevitably happen, as she is seeing all people in my family coming from the same environment. ",Human
4q3j91,"No, you're NOT the asshole. 

I don't understand how so few people here seem to understand the concept of trust in a therapeutical relationship. It's the most important part of the entire endeavour. Your therapist has violated that trust - wittingly or unwittingly, probably by accident and by underestimating how much privacy you need. All well and good, but the trust is gone.

If this has shaken you to your core, OP, leave and don't look back. Do yourself a favour and do find someone else, rapport is possible, trust is possible. 

If you got along with her well, I would recommend asking her for recommendations for other therapists when you talk about it with her (which I recommend you do, mostly because it will help to have some kind of closure).

OP, don't panic. Just find someone else.",Human
4q3j91,"I'm going to disagree with everyone and say you're not the asshole.  You're in a professional relationship with your therapist.  You need to be able to respect and trust her in order to grow.  She has done something that causes you to have less respect for her, possibly hindering your ability to gain from her therapy, which you (or someone) is paying for.

So you are not the asshole, but neither is the therapist, for the reasons others have outlined (a therapist has no obligation to take clients based on on the requests of other clients).  

If you politely cut off the relationship (""I appreciate your help, but I think I need to try someone else, thanks again!"") then it is simply exiting a professional relationship, which does not make anyone an asshole.

On a personal note, I would also not want to continue seeing that therapist.  Yes, they are obligated to not discuss clients with other clients.  But I would feel uncomfortable simply knowing that they know a lot about both me and my parents.  What if they accidentally slip? What if they know that knowledge that one has would help the other, and start trying to find oblique ways to convince one party to tell the other party? It would be awkward in my opinion.

As a second personal note, my brother had extreme social anxiety for many years.  He went to many therapists. The one that finally was able to help him grow by leaps and bounds was a cognitive behavior therapist.  It is a little scary, but one of the foundations of the",Human

4q3j91,"Thank you very much for you response. It is very well reasoned, and I thoroughly appreciate the amount of thought that you put into it. 

I agree, I suppose. I don't want to be an asshole in this situation. Due to my social circle being so limited, it has been hard to determine if I was. I definitely don't think my therapist is the asshole, but I just have a hard time trusting the situation. Due to my father's already extant relationship with my therapist, I find it somewhat difficult to bring stuff up to her because she has preconceived ideas about my parents and other people that I know.  This step, I guess, is just me reacting on that further. 

I believe that I will take your advice on this matter. I will definitely have a final conversation with her, and probably go on from there. I will be as polite as possible, of course, and further therapy from how that conversation proceeds.

I'm glad to hear that your brother got better. It is always good to hear about success stories from people in similar situations. If I do seek out a new therapist, I will probably seek out someone who does CBT.

4q3j91,"If it ""inevitably happens"" and you have specifically disallowed her from disclosing information to your family, she is seriously violating HIPPA and you can definitely fire her for that. (Actually, she can face legal action or lose her license for that) No, she shouldn't see several family members at the same time, but even if she does, she is legally bound to keep patient files and details confidential. And if she's worth her salt as a therapist and professional, she won't violate confidentiality. 

That said, she's a businessperson who needs clients. She is not your friend or your family or any relation to you other than that she needs you and your family's insurance money. You're a client. You can't really blame her for taking more clients. If that violates trust in her, then that's your problem and not hers. But again, she's only in the wrong if she breaks confidentiality. Also, *everyone* is recommended to psych help for a reason. That is, everyone's family talks to the therapist/facility before their admission as a client. But anything after you sign in (or sign on) is strictly confidential even between family. ",Human
4q3j91,"It doesn't?

The concept of therapy is having a safe environment to talk about things that are hard to talk about with someone involved in your life. If your therapist hears about things that happen in your life by someone else than you (ie through *their* eyes, as it were), they're no longer purely impartial. Even the best therapist would ""pick sides"" accidentally (even if only in their own mind, I promise you you'll pick up on it quickly), or accidentally let slip something.

After all, therapists are real human beings who also make mistakes. A good therapist is the first to tell you that.

Imagine: something happens in your life, say, a fight with your dad. And both you and your dad feel the need to discuss it in a session with *the same therapist*. Would you trust them to fully believe you? Would you trust them to *not* take into account your dad's side of the story? Therapists are NOT judges of your private life, or they shouldn't be, anyway.

As soon as you have the feeling you have to hold back in therapy for whatever reason, it lost about 90% of the effectiveness. That is why trust is such a big issue to begin with.",Human

I did premarital counseling with a really good therapist. He was able to listen to both me and my fiancé over everything and we both came to really great conclusions with him.

4q3j91,"I don't think anyone here is the asshole, although I would reconsider firing your therapist until you have some more information. 

Your feelings of hurt are completely valid, though not necessarily something that your parents or therapist have a reasonable expectation of. Also, what went on during the consultation besides her telling your parents that she wouldn't counsel them without your permission? If that was the only thing of substance that she said, it seems like she was probably making your privacy and comfort a very high priority and like the issue was your parents thinking it would be ok. Also, did they make an appointment directly with her? I feel like she could have told them over the phone that she would only see them with your permission and you guys could have gone from there, so it might be worth asking about that. 

Have you seen your therapist since this happened? It's very important that you tell her honestly about how you feel. For starters, you're definitely not cool with her seeing your family in a therapy context. Secondly though, you should tell her very specifically what boundaries you'd like to set between her and your family (or anyone who knows you, for that matter). Considering that she and your dad have had a professional relationship since before you were born and you found her through your dad, it seems reasonable that she would assume it was ok for her to continue her professional relationship with your father and that this might be something ",Human
4q3j91,"I have mixed feelings about this.  

I don't think you're the asshole but I think you are definitely approaching this wrong.  Instead of firing her, you should just tell her that it bothers you and you would not like for them to get counseling from her.  That simple.  

She did not give them counseling yet, she gave them a consultation.  You have nothing to get worked up about.  

And, just tell mom and dad they need to find someone else.  She's YOUR therapist and you're just not ok with her being theirs as well.    ",Human

4q3j91,"Short answer, no. You have every right to not want to ""share"" your therapist.

Long answer:

I have a degree in a field that I could use to be a therapist. I've even taken all the the ethics classes. From what you've said, your therapist has done nothing unethical. You were informed that it was a possibility your parents would be seeing her. She has told you she won't see them/refer them if it bothers you. *IF* you think she isn't capable of keeping your sessions and your parents' sessions separate she shouldn't be a therapist. 

If you really are making progress with this therapist, I highly suggest you bring it up at your next session. Your therapist can't help you/your concerns without you talking about them. Lay it out for her, if she's any good at her job, she will understand and help you find a solution, whether that's not seeing your parents or helping you work through your feelings on the matter. ",Human
4q3j91,"No, you are absolutely not the asshole.   It feels intrusive and incestuous for all of you to be going to the same person, not to mention that if your dad already has a professional relationship with the therapist it is inappropriate for him to also have a therapeutic relationship with her.  I question the therapist's boundaries.  

 Your therapist needs to refer your parents elsewhere.  You had the first therapeutic relationship with her, so you have dibs if you want it, but it might be worth asking for a referral for yourself just in general, so you have a therapist who does NOT already have any kind of other relationship with a member of your family.

4qf1gd,"Well a few people already said that you're in the wrong thread and all, but as a food technologist I'll also give you an answer (though not a source)

If the ingredients list says it's grape juice, you can be pretty confident it's actual grape juice. If it's not, that'd count as food fraud and in most countries the punishments for that are quite severe. Also, a company would be ruined if anyone would find out, so it's extremely risky to commit such fraud from the companies perspective too. What is often allowed is to concentrate grape (or any other juice) first, and then dilute it later with de-mineralized or distilled water. Both are forms of  very pure water, purer than what comes out of a normal tap. Depending on legislation you're still free to call that ""Grape juice"", or you have to state""Grape juice from concentrate"". But, the fruit in it is still the same as the fruit listed on the package. 

Now that's for pure juices. For mixed juices, those are very often for a very large part apple juice. Because you know, apple juice is cheap, can be called ""natural"" or ""100% fruit"", sweet, doesn't have a very strong flavour so you don't need a lot of another flavour to be in balance. If you buy ""100% fruit grape-apple juice"" you can be sure it's at least 80% apple juice and maximal 20% grape juice for example, unless maybe it's some artisanal product.

In most countries, you wouldn't be allowed to advertise with just ""grape juice"" and then list in the ingredients that it's actual",Human

The possessive and jealousy thing you should talk to a therapist about. My ex had trust issues when we first started dating and it was the first time I had ever come across this because I tend to be a very open and honest person. After a while it ate away at me and became the reason for our demise (long distance caused way more jealousy than when we were together in college). My ex was this way because he was cheated on twice before me. He eventually got a lot better about it by going to therapy but when we became long distance it all came back again. 

But nah I don't think you're the ass hole because who tf goes into an ""open relationship"" after a fight. She just didn't have the strength to end it which is shitty towards you. ",Human

4qh352,"Similar situation here. Beating the shit out of the other guy was definitely satisfying, as well as keeping the car she needed so badly.

No downsides there in my experience, but YMMV.

Once I found out drugs were involved (heroin) I reported it to the school the guy worked for (teacher!). He'll be on the way out of the career and onto the streets in no time.

Best part is he never even knew my name.",Human

We only live together until 4 July. Independence day I guess eh? You make a really good point about there not being any closure, but I feel like this whole thing is just a big bleeding gash, so no matter how futile it is I just want to find a way to close it in whatever desperate, half baked way I can.

4qh352,"I agree in major part with your comment. Though the friends thing has consistently puzzled me. I didn't even care that her friends were so shitty, but I was just always baffled by how she would insist I spend time with them, attend the party full of them, and not harbour ill will toward this fucking asshole who she sleeps over with.

I just wanted to have me and them be separate parts of her life that didn't have to interact. Maybe that's just a stupid pipe dream. Either way, we probably won't be doing much interacting in the future, so I suppose it's irrelevant now anyway.

But I always tried to give them a shot because he liked them. 

But yea the whole thing with that other guy coming around and her sleeping over is fucking stupid and messed up!

You maybe should have talked about it a while ago, because it sounds like you kind of hit the breaking point.

The part that you kind acted like an a-hole was during the party it sounds like.  Kudos for recognizing that you didn't handle it well, but come on.  It was 1 night, and it was her birthday party.  I could sit down to dinner with Satan himself and keep my mouth shut for one night if it meant that much to the person I loved most.  It sounds like you may have done her a favor by setting up her party and leaving her to party with her friends and taking her out solo another time.  I don't really blame her friends for telling her to leave you based on the description of your behavior.  Yea, maybe they should mind their own business, but we've all had a friend who dates a tool and we all tell that friend he/she deserves better.  I'm not saying you're a bad person, but you may need to work some stuff out before embarking on a new relationship.",Human
4qh352,"You need to work on not being so jealous and possessive, but you probably already know that. She is an asshole for not just being upfront with you and just pushing you away until you broke up with her.

About the party, you were the asshole for acting the way you did, if you didn't want to be there then you should have left or just stayed in another room. She was an asshole for leaving with another guy.

Although you didn't handle the whole situation very well, the way your girlfriend acted is what as caused the anger and bitterness.

Final judgment, your being a little bit of an asshole, but she is the bigger asshole.

A stupid thing to ask for? Unquestionably. But some sordid part of my mind clings to the desire for it. She will move out soon and maybe then I can move on, though at this point I'm not sure if I feel like I can, though I just try to remember on an academic level that it will happen. ",Human

4qh352,"I haven't seen it pointed out in any other comments but I'm not done reading all of them yet, but there is one thing you really need to keep in mind for your next relationship. 

A big reason she got so distant and ignored you might have been how vocal you are about your dislike for her friends. I had a boyfriend who was like that and it made me shut off. I didn't try to ignore him, but I ended up doing it without trying. I just got tired of hearing about how much he didn't like them whenever I would go to talk about them. And it wasn't just him flat out saying he didn't like them.. I loved him and could read his body language really well so he didn't even need to say stuff like ""they're boring"" or ""why do you hang out with them"" because I could tell he was thinking it. 

You aren't going to like all of your significant others friends, but unless they are being hostile and/or malicious you shouldn't be very vocal about it. Telling them that you personally wouldn't like to hang out with them because you don't really like them is perfectly fine, but being hostile about it will make them shut off like that. ",Human
4qh352,"Humorously we actually talked about this after I posted this. She said the reason she started ignoring me was my mental condition degraded (I'm bipolar) and I apparently became very angry (I would like to point out I didn't get angry directly at her, just generally angry at life) and difficult to be around. I understand that it's difficult to be around unbalanced people  but I'm still pretty resentful about her just peacing out on me instead of telling me it was affecting her so we might work through it or that I could re-approach treatment in some way. 

As far as the friends went, she always seemed to know I didn't like them but I tried to keep my mouth shut about it and just avoid them. I didn't dislike all of them (contrary to her assertions) but the ones I disliked were mostly work friends and I just felt that place attracted pretty shoddy people. But fuck it, I guess all those things are in my past now anyway.

4qh352,"That's a very good question! *Puts on mod hat.*  We decide the flair based on the top comment.  It's funny because when I first became a moderator here I thought that we were supposed to give flair based on, like you said, the asshole-to-non-asshole ratio of comments.",Human
4qh352,"That's a tough situation for both of you, I'm sorry to hear that. :/

As someone who has been on both sides, you don't have to forgive her but try not to hold I to the resent. There are so many stigmas around mental health.. People who don't have any mental health issues have this pressure from society where they almost need to be the one to take care of you. She could have felt that it was wrong to let it affect her and since you're a bit unbalanced she might not have known how to even touch that topic with you. 

It fucking sucks but it'll get better eventually.. Maybe not for us, but at least for our children there may be enough light shed on mental health that these stigmas don't exist. 

I truly hope that things get better for you and you find someone who can make you happy and understand what you're going through. Best wishes, and good luck. &lt;3",Human

Also, if she's not in the same 'able to spend' bracket as you she may feel she can't do anything as good/expensive as what you did.",Human

I didn't get my panties in a twist about it because I'm not a child anymore who NEEDS to have a celebration for their birthday.

Also it was ONE day of missed communication. It was just bad timing that it happened to be on your birthday. Demanding that she go out of her way to borrow someone's phone or their computer to log into FB to message you is something I'd expect from a 16 year-old, not a grown-ass man.",Human

You're *juuuuuust* about to learn that your birthday really isn't as big a deal as you currently think it is. Relax a bit about it because 99% of the time being a little baby about your birthday makes you the asshole. 

Now that being said, her not calling you and then making up bullshit excuses - the broken phone thing is a pathetic excuse - is absolutely inconsiderate behavior. From what you've posted here it doesn't seem like she values you or your feelings very much.

1. Disrespecting your mother for no reason
2. Mocking somebody in need of financial help
3. Going back on your promise to help that person
4. Dealing with the dispute you caused in the most childish manner possible

Would you want somebody to treat you in this way when you need help? Do you think that people in need are going to feel that they can come to you for help?

You don't sound like an asshole, as you said that you feel bad for what happened, but you do sound like a child who did a very thoughtless thing and acted like an asshole. I sincerely hope you're a child, because if you aren't, I would be extremely concerned with your impulse control.",Human

4qj5bx,"No problem. If you want to repair the damage, go and do it! 

1. Tell her that you feel bad about what you did and list the reasons why it was wrong. Tell her that you are sorry about making harsh jokes. 

2. Assure her that she can always come to you for help if she needs it, and that you won't back out on your obligations again. Make sure that she is not in more serious financial difficulties, and if you can help, you should. Being down to one's last 20 dollars is stressful.

3. Do a little introspection, and ask yourself why you reacted the way you did. Why did you make that joke, why did you lock the door, why did you go back on your promise, when the right thing to do would have been so easy? Whether it was pride, or lack of impulse control, or a cruel sense of humor, there is something in your personality that made you act in ways you acknowledge are harmful, and you would do well to analyze that.

4. Promise your mother and yourself that you won't repeat the behavior that caused this problem, and the next time this comes up keep your promise.

In life, it is almost inevitable that you will hurt somebody without thinking.

6xb5m0,"I was in the subway with my friend, next to a pole. An elderly lady was sitting about 6 feet from us. I was hanging on to the pole, and my friend wasn't, so when the train started, he went back a step. The lady told him to hold on to the pole to not fall on her, and he did.


Anyway, I moved a bit and forgot to hang on to the pole. Again, the train started and I went back one small step, not touching the lady. She told me to hang on to the pole, this time she looked a little angry. The way she said it was quite rough, so I told her I'm sorry, but I haven't touched her and I'm usually careful (never fell while doing this).


My friend then exits the train and while I walk to a seat, the lady mumbles ""Yeah, sit down."", to which I respond ""What did you say?"" and proceeded to take a seat. The lady looked at me and turned around.


The lady wasn't very respectful, but I still felt like an asshole for talking back to her and not simply ignoring her. Also, I feel like an asshole because despite her way of telling me to hang on, I could've simply obliged.


So, am I the asshole here?

6xb5m0,"I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: as entitled people age, their sense of entitlement goes through the roof.

My mom's in a retirement community and she was telling me just yesterday about these old ladies who steal all of the food from the potlucks and then get all snippety when confronted about it. Like...it's not your food to take home. 

As these people get older, they get bolder. Or maybe they lose their filter to dementia. I don't know. But I do know that you cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile. I've seen it way too many times. They use their age as a licence to get away with murder. 

I generally have a comeback along the lines of ""With age comes wisdom, one would think a person of such advanced age would be wise enough to know when to keep their comments to themselves.""

And if that doesn't work, you can remind them that we won't have to put up with their sourpuss attitude much longer, so enjoy it while it lasts. ",Human

6xhojo,"I'm home on vacation for a short amount of time before leaving the country for a year. About a week ago my brother introduced me to his friend, let's call her Cecelia. Now, Cecelia and my brother work together, and have been friends for a bit over a year, as far as I'm aware. Cecelia also just got out of a relationship that she was in for about a year. 

Before I met Cecelia, my brother told me, ""I wouldn't be able to handle Cecelia's crazy, it's probably somewhat related to why she's no longer in the relationship she just got out of.""

I hung out with Cecelia at my brother's apartment a few more times this week and every night Cecelia and I would stay up talking past midnight, even though she had to work the following day. I wasn't really able to sleep well do to being incredibly anxious about moving out of the country, so we just talked. 

On the third night Cecelia and I kissed and slept on the couch together. The same thing happened the fourth night but at some point my brother came out and saw that her and I were cuddled up on the couch (completely clothed mind you). I saw him because I really wasn't able to sleep much, and I heard him come out.

I decided to tell my brother that I had a thing for Cecelia, because I didn't want it to come and bite me in the ass. After I told my him that I had a thing for Cecelia, he told me he kind of saw it coming, but asked me not to act on the feelings I had due to her just getting out of a relationship, and my leaving the country for",Human
6xhojo,"If I'm following along correctly, you and your brother are both into the same girl and she's only into you.

In my own opinion, if you continue trying to pursue this woman against your brother's wish, then that would make you an asshole. Otherwise, you'll be starting shit with your brother. I'm against the idea that a man can ""stake claim"" to a woman, but you have to ask yourself if it's worth the trouble. You're leaving for almost a year. and you're only home for a short period of time. It's very possible that she won't have any interest in pursuing a long distance relationship with you. 

It really depends on what you value. If you value your relationship with your brother and want to stay on amicable terms after you leave the country, then I'd drop what you're doing.  ",Human
6xhojo,"Not an asshole.

Your brothers 'reasons' of her being crazy, and then her being too recently single, are pretty disrespectful to this girl. She gets to decide for herself when she is ready to date again.

He's probably just coming up with alternative reasons to get you to back off because he feels bad telling you to back off so he can have his chance.

His earlier 'crazy' statement is obvious deflection.
Your discussing his feelings with her is a breach of his trust, and you'd be pissed if he did the same to you.  Just because she likes you better doesn't make it right.  I will say the total amount of time in play here matters. If the 'short amount of time' is a year, it might soften my feelings... a little. ",Human
6xhojo,"I feel what you're saying, but I also think it matters how he really feels about this girl. If he just wants a casual fling or hookup, then yeah why hurt your brothers feelings when you could do that with any girl. But if he genuinely has feelings for her and thinks they could have something special, then who is the brother to stand in the way of that? She likes OP, not the brother, and if the brother was to get in the way of a genuine relationship because of his own unrequited feelings, I'd feel like he's the one in the wrong. ",Human
6xhojo,"He just needs to consider whether a relationship that is more than likely going to fall through is worth upsetting his brother. He's leaving the country soon and he'll be gone for a year.

6xqyf1,"So this happened last weekend. I was in Seattle with my best friend who was up from New Jersey visiting me for the weekend. We went to one of my favorite pizza places in town, Windy City Pie. They do a great Chicago Style Deep Dish, so the pizzas are pretty filling. I normally go plain but they heavily recommend getting toppings so I got an extra pizza for my friend so he could try some of their toppings while I had my cheese pizza. It turned out to be too much for him to eat so he decided to give his left overs (about 2/3rds of a pie) to a group of people waiting in line who seemed a little hesitant about the wait. They were really grateful and bought my friend a beer. It wasn't until afterward that I realized we just cost the place a pie, but I think we may have also gotten them some repeat business from the people who might not have stayed for their pie anyway given the wait. So are we assholes / did we do the wrong thing, or is it something that isn't really that big of a deal. I don't have a lot of insight into the restaurant business but I know it can be difficult.

6xvf2m,"So my boyfriend of 2years is moving in with me on Tuesday. He lives with 3 of his friends in an apartment downtown, and I have my own apartment on the other side of town. So far I've done most of the prepwork myself, I've disassembled my old couch, bed and other various things and moved them downstairs (4 flights) on my own or with the people who bought them from me. I've also moved the new ikea things upstairs with the people who delivered them. I've been sleeping without my bed since Friday, and I'm living surrounded by boxes since Wednesday. 

Tuesday he's going to hire a van and deliver his stuff to mine, with the help of his mother. I'm really glad, to me it's a special moment. It's the day we finally move in together. I kind of, sort of, expected that we would have dinner afterwards. Also, it's a lot of work. Moving stuff from there to here, assembling 3 closets, a bed and then putting all of our things into them. Clean up the place and stuff. It will take at least all day.

Here's the catch though; one of his friends from overseas that he only sees once every few years is over. He's been here since yesterday I think, and he leaves on Wednesday. They were supposed to meet up tonight, and see each other maybe tomorrow as well. But that was cancelled. Now he and his friends want to have dinner together on Tuesday. At 7pm. My boyfriend thinks I'm an asshole for telling him that I don't like that. So, am I an asshole? Just saying that I'm not forcing him to not have dinner ",Human

You should however let him know how important this moment is to you and explain to him how much it means to you to celebrate it.  Go out on a different night with the same intent of it being to celebrate this major moment.  There is also the option (if you both cook) to make something together in your new shared place as a way to ""christen"" it.  I don't believe that you are an asshole for this or at the same time he is either.  It is really sweet that you wish to take the time and celebrate this with with him and hopefully he sees that too; so in the end why not do both?

She was saying things like..

""Why are you friends with her again? Weren't we just mad at her? She's/You're disgusting! Did you remember what she did to me? I can't believe you just betrayed me like this.""

I am still yet to understand her reasoning for saying things like that, since the argument was very petty and not a sensitive topic. 

I want to break ties with her, because of all these unnecessary comments she was making just because I was friends with her again. But am I an asshole for doing that?

6xyy1g,"I was on the underground last night with my earphones in. This guy comes along the carridge and he looks like hes about to ask people for money. I can't really hear what he is saying but then he looks at me and asks me a question. I take out my earphones and ask him to repeat himself and he asks me to choose from 5 different words. I choose one and he goes on to say that he is a traveling poet who will make a poem based on the word I chose, and at the end we can give a tip if we like it. At this point I'm thinking oh shit I don't want him to busk as I do not have any money, but maybe it will be ok as I am off at the next stop and maybe I can sneak out. The guy proceeds to quickly ramble this poem that I could not really hear a word of, that finished just as we got to the next stop (now I think about it, they are probably planned that way). He finishes and asks for some coins. I tell him that I'm sorry but I do not have any money and start to move towards the door. He gets a bit annoyed and squares up to me a bit and asks why I chose a poem if I knew he was a busker and didn't have any money. I tell him that all I heard was him asking me a question and that I didn't hear the busker bit until after, but he doesn't believe me and eventually walks off swearing at me as I leave the train.

6y0bkw,"I caused a motor accident, in which I was the party at fault. To explain the situation simply, I drove into someone while trying to evade an emergency vehicle. 

There was only minor damage to both vehicles, but the other driver did not have insurance, which complicates things a little.

My insurance company approved my claim and repaired my vehicle, but they seems to have found a legal loophole to decline the other driver's claim (the involvement of an emergency vehicle; this is not in the USA, if you're wondering). The other driver is therefore left with a damaged car and no payment, unless she can muster up legal fees to take on my insurance company (which I suspect she can't).

I have not spoken to lawyer, other than the one that represents my insurance company (and me) against the other driver. 

Am I the asshole for leaving the situation as is? Should I be trying to help her personally? I could try to find the money to help her, but it would be a huge knock to my finances.

Legally, if you were the cause of the accident but the law where you live does not consider you to be at fault for it, then there really isn't anything to argue.

You *can* look at it that way, but it's not fair or anything.

I don't have insurance on all of my possessions.  Some I do, some I don't.  I'm taking the risk that *I* will break my stuff, or that through no one's fault, it breaks.

But that doesn't translate to a situation where someone else is at fault and breaks my stuff.  If they broke it, they should fix it.

If OP is at fault, then he should should pay.  If he has insurance to pay, great.  If he doesn't, he has to pay out of pocket.

In this situation, he has shitty insurance that isn't paying even though it SHOULD be.  So it's the same as not having insurance at all.  So he should pay.

It all comes down to if he's really at fault or not - which I don't know.  OP says he was though, so he should pay.

If his insurance says, ""Yes, you were at fault, but we have a way to weasel out of it"" then that's not cool.  If though the insurance is saying ""it may have looked like you were at fault, but such-and-such means that it actually *wasn't* your fault"" then that's another story.",Human

I didn't want to assume she was flaking on me so the next day (18 hours later) I sent a text wishing her luck with the emotional issue preventing her from calling me. 16 hours later, still no call but a text telling me I was judgmental because her cousin needed her more than calling me to ""catch up"". She also tells me everyone comes to her with their problems and she should charge for being a shrink. This is now two days after she said she would call me. I text her that there was nothing judgmental and I just wanted her to be considerate about keeping her word. I also told her if she's too busy, maybe we shouldn't remain friends. BOOM! She says I'm being a judgmental asshole to the only person willing to keep a decent relationship with me, and she was helping her cousin out with a problem so I can cram it up my ass! Huh?! Game over, I replied simply. Okay. 
If it makes any difference, it cost me $2.5K for her part of the vacation. I never said a word about it becaus",Human

First, you assume she must have an ""emotional issue"" because she didn't call you. If she didn't call you when she said she would she's busy. Give the lady a day to catch up with stuff instead of accusing her of ""emotional issues""...that is definitely judgmental.

And then, a day later...all of this is taking space *within 24 hours*....you declare you shouldn't be friends with her because she didn't call you one night because she had other issues. Your asshole has now grown its own asshole, if you will. She is allowed to have a life outside of you without you declaring that you can't be friends because she won't drop everything the minute you demand it.

And you finally put the cherry on the sundae of assholeness by making it clear by the use of the word ""Friend-zone"" that all of this ""being friends"" stuff is bullshit...you just want to get in her pants and by not promptly responding to your beck and call, she has thwarted that.",Human

6y38z6,"I'm a new grad student. Today one of my deskmates brought her emotional support dog into our studio workspace. I asked her about it and she told me it was an anxiety dog, which is a little ironic because dogs give me major anxiety, although I can work with it if it's a well-trained service dog and stays away from me.

This dog was not well trained. It whined loudly the entire time it was there, wouldn't sit still, and barked whenever anybody entered the room. It was distracting and the barking really freaked me out. I wound up needing to move to a table across the room, which helped a bit but isn't typically an option.

From my understanding, emotional support animals are not permitted in classrooms (I have an emotional support cat that I would never bring anywhere public), although from googling a bit I found that there are exceptions to this. I emailed my professor asking for clarification and he told me he would find out for me.

I would be really relieved to have this dog out of the workspace, but otoh I feel bad being so afraid of and distracted by this girl's anxiety support dog, which obviously she must feel she needs or she wouldn't bring it with her. Should I try harder to adjust to the animal? AITA for wanting it out of the class environment?

Her rights end where yours begin. Or more kindly, because she's not an asshole either, your anxiety is just as important as hers. 

An emotional support dog that has not been trained and certified is not legally required to be allowed to enter any places that would otherwise prohibit animals, but you are being very reasonable considering her anxiety too. They aren't required to be allowed specifically for the reasons you explained, they can be a major distraction, and even a risk to other people without training. I don't think you'd be an asshole for asking that she doesn't dig the dog. I wouldn't be if I asked for that because I have asthma. Anxiety is just as real. Our health is as important as hers and if the dog was medically necessary, a doctor would be certifying this so.



",Human
6y38z6,"Not an asshole at all.

If I remember correctly, emotional support animals are allowed in public on the condition that they behave well.

This dog obviously is not behaving well. And honestly, if it's under the line of 'emotional support animal' and not 'service dog', this means it hasn't been trained to perform a specific task that alleviates the owner's anxiety...in my experience (limited though it is) a lot of people who get ESAs for the sole purpose of bringing them around in public with them just want an excuse to bring their dog around with them. ESAs are totally valid but when they're as untrained as this one...eh, I'm not feeling much sympathy for the other girl.",Human
6y38z6,"ESAs are allowed to live in places that don't normally allow pets, and are allowed to fly with their owners when they might not otherwise be permitted on the flight.

I just didn't want to pay my apartment's $50/month ""pet fee"" (so I'm a bit of an asshole, sorry) but I would never bring my dog in public and claim he was a support animal. But I'm just posting to say that it is really that easy to do and I bet it is just her pet.",Human
6y38z6,"I will add to this, I was a waitress once and we asked for verification that a dog was a service dog, and they gave us a card (laminated, like a license) that said the dog was certified... but here's the kicker, it had NO picture of the dog, NO description of the dog, and judging by the way it was crookedly cut, I would say this woman laminated it herself. Our manager still kicked her out bc her dog would not behave.",Human
6y38z6,"ESAs and service animals are not the same thing.

(That being said, ESAs don't have as many access rights as service animals, so this doesn't mean the girl has more of a right to bring her dog. I'm just clarifying for anyone who might be confused).

Also, it is possible for dogs to be legitimate service dogs, and badly trained/behaved. That's why business owners *are* legally allowed to expel real service animals if they are badly behaved or out of control.",Human
6y38z6,"Not necessarily. There's actually nothing in the definition of ESA's that states that they are well behaved. That being said, if the dog isn't well behaved, she shouldn't be taking it places.

There's actually no such thing as certification for service animals. Any official looking document would have been someone scamming the owner.

That's actually service animals. ESA's are different, and have no special access rights, (unless a university or business owner decides on their own, (no legal obligation) to grant access).

There is no way that OP has the legal right to do that. 

Also, no certification exists for either ESAs or service animals. They are defined by the function they perform, and the only certification would be a doctor's note.

so last year i was best friends with amanda. like, up each other's ass best friends to the point where we were planning to have a joint graduation party this year. then, this summer i went to an academic summer program and while i was gone, everyone got closer without me. apparently everyone was also annoyed with me talking about my summer program, i really loved the place and the people there and i was excited to share. but no one had told me something was brewing until the day i got back. i was talking to amanda and she was giving me short, one-word responses like ""ok"" to everything. i was so frustrated because i felt like something had been off just like this for the past few weeks, so i went off and asked her what was really up and we got into a huge argument. she then ignored me for days without an answer as to why she was acting this way. 

i went out with our mutual friend, brittany, the day after, and brittany was surprised to know that i had no idea what was going on for the past few weeks. brittany told me that our other friend, sarah, and amanda are now best friends and tell each other everything. including some problems that me and amanda both had with sarah that i had intended to bring up with sarah personally when they happened.

I agree that his interpretation of that statement is often more accurate than hers, but there isn't a factual, objective answer. That is especially true considering the massive difference in meanings the statement can acquire based on the speaker's tone. 

Communication isn't about being **right**, it's about being **effective.** 

In a relationship, *both* people have a responsibility to make sure their communications with each other are *effective.* The sole reason this issue existed is because both of them failed to proactively assure the effectiveness of the communication. ",Human

For the past few years, my friend H and I have been working to help him through his issues.  You see, V also has a lot of unchecked anger, and he won't confront it.  He complains about his anger issues and the like, but he won't take any advice on how to fix it.  My friend H and I have both experienced depression as well, and we often try to help V with a few bad habits that can make it worse (like poor sleeping, eating habits, and overloading himself work-wise).

You actually sound like a pretty good person and friend.

I'd back off the advice, but define boundaries for what you'll personally tolerate from him. That will protect you while also *potentially* helping him realize the consequences of his behavior. 

Ex: let's say he severely overreacts to minor nuisances by punching the wall. Next time he does it, you could say, ""this violent response makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to leave."" 

That way he knows what you're doing and can decide if/how he wants to react. Don't lecture or advise - just do it, and be consistent every time he punches a wall.

To get the ball rolling, I'm fifteen (so I can't go anywhere) and I am at school from 8 AM to 3:06 (odd time I know).

The first thing I do when I get home is play my guitar for about ten minutes until my older sister comes home from work. 
She then will start bitching to me about some irrelevant bullshit for another hour and a half (while I'm trying to do homework) before my dad comes home. Then I get lectured on why I'm a lazy degenerate for not doing something even though I have been doing homework except for the first ten minutes. Within a few minutes of my dad coming home, my mom comes home and then she starts arguing with my dad or my sister over some more irrelevant things. While these arguments are taking place I try to get in a few more minutes of practice instead of being caught in the middle of some bullshit argument.

1. She'll stay somewhere in the city centre, we'll meet after work and go to my place together. This option is not that good for my friend because she has to get up early.

2. She'll come before I go to work, stay in the apartment and I'll return from work in the middle of the night. She'll have to be in the apartment the whole time, as I'll need to take the keys so I can get back. Also from the roommates' point of view, there'll be a strange girl in my room.

3. I can just give her the keys, this would work best for her. But I don't know if I'd be OK with any of my roommates giving keys to a stranger, so I thing this might be disrespectful to them.

When summer came around, she got a job at a summer camp, and was gone Sunday-Friday every week. I took care of the cat then as well. At the end of summer, my dad told me he wanted the cat out of the house. So when I left I told her I was taking him multiple times, and she always blew it off as a joke.

Of course you're the asshole.  You don't tell people you're taking their property.  ""Oh, you haven't used such-and-such, so it's just mine now.""  What the hell?

It's even worse with a living creature - that's not even just a possession for you to steal, it's more like kidnapping.

You talk about how you took care of the cat, but you didn't say the cat was neglected and abused and you were rescuing it from a cruel or shitty owner.  If you really felt you had a moral right to the cat (like CPS taking a child from an abusive parent) you would have led with that, and explained that to your sister.

So you didn't actually think the cat was being harmed and you were rescuing it.  You just stole her cat, told her you were doing it, not asked, knew she didn't take it seriously (because she didn't believe you were as big an asshole as you actually are, way to destroy her faith in you and betray her), and did it all anyway.

You mention the dad wanted the cat out of the house, but if you didn't steal the cat, was he going to have it put to sleep?  Again, if you were really rescuing the cat, you'd have said so.

Clearly, you're being a complete asshole about this.

Your sister is right to never speak to you again for the rest of your LIFE, unless you give the cat back and admit you were wrong.

It sounds like your sister is a kid who took on a responsibility she maybe wasn't ready for.

Cat's welfare &gt; sister's feelings 

**1.**  Facts presented suggest kitten was something of an ""impulse buy"" for sis, made with reckless disregard for cat's wellbeing or the sis's responsibility towards it: 

- minor sis brought home kitten without permission

 (risk: won't be allowed to keep it, potentially deprived kitten of chance to go to good home) 

- sis was out of house for 5/7 days each week during summer

(Sis knew of commitments when taking kitten, or assumed commitments without care for the cat - neglect.)

- sis is 17, presumably going to college soon ... presumably will be living out of home, potentially under circumstances that prevent her from taking the cat with her (dorms don't allow pets generally) 

(Foreseeable risk of abandoning cat with parents who don't want and may not keep cat) 

If facts presented are true, sister is not currently able and/or willing to properly care for the kitten. 

*However,* without actual harm to the cat, that in and of itself may not warrant ""stealing"" someone's pet. 

In this case, perhaps the parents would have picked up the sister's slack... not a great life for the cat, but perhaps acceptable. 

**Except....**

**2.**  The owner of the property said cat couldn't stay on property.

6yvf2g,"Of course *that's* not neglect. 

But taking a summer job that kept her away from home 5/7 days per week, leaving it with her family (including parents who don't want it), is neglectful. 

When her dad said it couldn't stay in the house, she apparently ignored that and made no efforts to change his decision or to find the cat a good home - as though just ignoring the problem would make it go away. That's neglect. 

If she plans to move out of the home to go to college, then she got a cat knowing that she'd likely be leaving it at her parents (who again, don't want it) within 1-2 years .... that's neglectful. Cats live a lot longer than 1-2 years (well, hers might not have).

It's more his cat anyways, sounds like all she did was bring it home.  If OPs sister is that hurt about it, it's her own doing.   OP did the right thing by listening to dad, and telling her that he was taking the cat.  It's not his fault she didn't take him seriously.",Human
6yvf2g,"You're the asshole. You should have really explained the situation and sure your sister understood that you were serious and why. Not in a ""I'm taking your cat because you were never there for it"" kind of way. Instead being like ""dad wants it out of the house and I'm moving out. You'll likely be here still, so I want to *ask* you if I can take it for a while."" Because asking is what people are supposed to do when they want something. 

Everyone in here is probably finding it sooo easy to call the sister the asshole and you're completely fine because *it was justified! She was neglecting her cat!* but that doesn't make you not the asshole. As well I don't believe she would not be home if no one else was available to take care of it.

6yvf2g,"Well I'm just going by the facts that OP has stated. You're right that for all we know there could be other factors that change this. But as OP's written it, with no other speculation, OP is definitely, absolutely the asshole.

The problem I have isn't that OP ended up with the cat - it's how she got it. She just took it. I mean, apparently she joked about it a few times, but by her own admission she made it sound like she was only joking. Had she sat down with her sister and explained what was going on, then fine. But the cat was unquestionably her sister's, and she didn't bother to actually talk to her like an adult about taking the cat. 100% asshole. 

The only way I can see it being ok to take the cat without talking about it first is if the cat was being abused, but from what OP has written there's no indication of that. It wasn't even being neglected. It was being taken care of by the family. Sure, they have a right to change that arrangement if they don't like it, but not without talking to her first.",Human

Sigh.  She's only acting like *AFTER* OP already stole the cat after not communicating with her at all sufficiently about why.

We don't know what really happened.  You're imagining a lot more shitty behavior on part of the sister than what we've been given, and a lot more reasonable behavior on the part of OP than what we've been given.

OP did not argue to the sister that the cat was being abused.  OP did not tell us that the cat would have been taken to the pound if OP didn't take it.  OP didn't explain this to the sister so she actually understood.  OP just took the cat.  The sister has a right to throw a wobbly after she's been disrespected like that.",Human

The sisters feelings were absolutely disregarded no matter what.  Which makes OP the asshole no matter what.

6yvw3u,"Without getting into too many details a brief backstory. He owes me close to 10k dollars, all of which I got through student loans. Started with big loans and then small loans one after the other every time he went over his budget. He has a history of delayed pay-backs but I thought with me it would be different. After a while I kept discussing our money problems calmly but a few months ago I snapped and had an angrier conversation. Since then he has been a little more hesitant about asking me for anything at all really. 


Lately he started asking again and at least he started paying back the new loans fairly quickly, but I really don't want to be his personal bank. He keeps guilting me into paying saying we need food (we live together) and other supplies, while he hasn't had a consistent job in forever and does 0 budgeting. He just spends and spends and then comes to me when he has nothing left again. He acts like a millionaire when he has money... The kind that likes to show off how much he spent too. 


Meanwhile I'm still only getting student loans and all this loaning has really affected me negatively over the years. Like more than you can imagine. Both academically and mentally. I can get really angry when I think about how much he owes me and especially why... I get even angrier when in his eyes I'm probably being greedy or acting like a terrible son because I bring this shit up.


 Today he asked a small amount for food again and as soon as he heard I was hesitant to",Human
6yvw3u,Not the asshole. You need to set some boundaries and stick with them.,Human
6yvw3u,"Not the asshole. You need to be more selfish. You are not wrong. Don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm. 

Also a good rule for loaning money is to NOT. If you have money to spare, give it away and don't expect it back. If he hasn't even paid you back all that he owes you, he can't borrow more. That's not how banks work, why should it be how you work?",Human
6yvw3u,"Not the asshole. 

You've already enabled him so he's likely to be a bitch about this, but face it, you're never getting that 10k back. 

Save up and move out when you can, never give him another dime. If you need food, go grocery shopping, but he doesn't handle that money, you do. It's your fucking money. 

Oh, and while I'm at it, your his son. It's not your job to provide for him at all, you're doing him a favour by even buying groceries. He's your dad, he chose to have you, he's supposed to be the responsible one. 
",Human
6yvw3u,"No, you're not wrong, and you're **definitely** not the asshole. 

Think about it this way: 

When you gave your dad those loans, did it actually help him? 

Sure, it made him happy, maybe even solved a short term problem. But if I understand your post correctly, he's still basically in the exact same position he was in when you ""helped"" him .... no consistent job or financial responsibility, still guilting you into giving him your money. 

You're NOT helping him: you're his atm, and his ""job"" is guilting you into handing over the cash. This type of problem, left alone, only gets worse. 

You can't ruin your life simply to let him avoid managing his own. 

**The ""We Need Food"" Ploy**

That's *such* an asshole move, because you'd have to be heartless to not let it get to you. 

You say you live with him, so here's what you do if it's a serious need:

Never, ever, **ever** give him money for food again. 
Go buy food for the house yourself and make sure he knows its there.

6z5een,"Throwaway account because ex is a redditor. Also not really looking for relationship advice or anything like that.

So my ex that I dated for about 2 years. We were fairly off and on during those 2 years, argued a lot, communication was a pretty big downfall of ours. We both have fiery tempers and while we never said anything particularly rude and definitely never did any physical harm, I always felt we were both too quick to just break it off over an argument. Our ""breakups"" usually lasted long enough for us to cool off, maybe about a week at most. 

I know, it was unhealthy.

Anyway, last summer we had a really bad break up. Since then things have been tense between us most of the time, with a few glimmering moments of friendship. He was there for me when my dad passed away suddenly a few months ago and from that time, he and I had been in contact more often than we had been before. Little by little, it got to talking about mundane subjects every day, he'd tell me about his son, he'd ask how my day at work was, I'd ask how his work was going...that sort of thing. It eventually progressed to light flirting. 

We weren't getting back together or anything but I thought we would at least get to be friends again. We were talking every day, all day and all night mostly. 

A few weekends ago, I happened to be up in the city he lives in and he did me a favor so I ended up seeing him for the first time in a year. We ended up sitting in his truck and talking and the whole time he was",Human
6z5een,Are you sure he was ghosting you? Sounds to me like he was honestly just getting busy and treating you like a friend instead of a girlfriend. Friends sometimes go days or even weeks without a response just cuz someone got really busy. ,Human

Plus he has the habit of assuming I'm ignoring him and calling me out on it so I assumed the questioning was fair.",Human
6z5een,"I should make it a little clearer that the ""ghosting"" happened within a day or so. The day he found out I came back home (he lives out of town) is the day he started ignoring me or being short with me.",Human
6z5een,"Ghosting is lame.  It sounds like it's for the best you two don't try to be friends, he probably can't stop catching the feelings, realizes it's not going to work out, and wants out.

Yes, he should just say so, especially after you called him out on it.",Human
6z5een,Thank you for the input!,Human
6z5een,"The timing on it may suck but there really is a chance he just got busy. When you're dating or really really close friends it's fair to expect a text or two every day, but when you're just regular old friends expecting him to prioritize you in his little free time is a bit much. I'm not meaning to sound rude saying this either, but I've been on both sides of situations like this so I'm just trying to provide a little perspective. 

Do you talk to all your friends individually every single day? Or do you go a while without talking to some of them? I bet it's the latter, as I don't know a single person with more than five friends who does the former.

I don't think either of you are being assholes, I think you may just be expecting things to be the way they were before you became exs. But the truth is most people can't be friends with their exs, the ones who do either end up being the closest friends imaginable, or distant friends. It sounds like you're wanting to be close friends and he just wants to be distant friends. Hell, maybe he's even just backing off a bit because he regrets or feels awkward about the kiss. Maybe he has feelings for you and wants to distance himself so he doesn't get hurt. Maybe he is ghosting you.

What it boils down to is trust. He said he isn't ghosting you and he's just been busy, you should have trusted him the first time he said it. Now that you've freaked out at him twice (in his eyes), he will probably be even more distant even if he isn't busy",Human
6z5een,"To be honest I don't have any real friends lol the ""friends"" I have are the people I work with so I see them Monday-Friday. Then one other ex that I talk to every day. So when he and I started talking again, it was rare to find a day when he and I didn't speak to each other. Even when he had his son for the summer and I expected him to drop out of the conversation. 

Don't take the lack of friends as a sign that I clung to this guy like a stage 5 clinger lol there's just been a lot that's been happening and a lot of issues I've had that have kind of caused me to shut down over the past few years.

I understand where you're coming from. I guess without knowing the other factors in what's going on and what has happened between us, it does seem to be innocent.

Thanks for your input!",Human
6z5een,"Thank you for your input! I know with him I have the habit of being really high strung so I tended to get on his nerves a bit. And while he and I have had some bad fights that have resulted in us not speaking to each other for some time, it was ALWAYS after a fight, not just out of the blue. That's what's throwing me off the most here.

I sent him an email the other day reiterating the fact that I understood that no real feelings may have been the basis for the kiss and that ultimately I just missed having my friend. ",Human
6z5een,"&gt; am I the asshole for thinking that a few kisses wouldn't ruin a decent friendship

Friends don't kiss each other.

It sounds like you two are better off apart. Leave him be.",Human
6z5een,"Would you be ok with him just coming out and saying that this is the new normal in your friendship? That you won't be talking every day and that you are now a contact-once-in-a-while kind of friend? 

I think it'll be easier on you if you just assume he said it. I know it's possible he has just gotten busy, and that could have been the reason too, but as you said, it is very unusual for you to not be in contact daily, even after you broke up, so I think this is his way of communicating to you that he wants to pull way back on your relationship. 

Is it shitty of him to do it this way? Absolutely. Does it make you an asshole for feeling like he should have handled it better? Not at all! 

Nevertheless, you guys already gave a serious go at redrawing your boundaries after you broke up and ... well.. once you were in physical proximity, that didn't go that great. If he's serious about staying broken up, he probably feels more drastic action is required. 

It is a completely reasonable position for him to take. And if this is what is happening, it should be him telling you this, not a rando on the internet. So for your own peace of mind, just pretend that he did and start moving forward. You guys both could probably stand to get some distance from each other. ",Human

My bedroom is right next to theirs and after about ten minutes of trying to sleep through it, I got up and knocked on their door and when my grandfather answered said, ""Hey, sorry to bother you, but could you please turn it down just a bit?"" He got in a bit of a huff say yes and go to sleep and turned the music off. The next morning he said I needed to apologize to him and my grandmother for being so rude and arrogant and how it was disrespectful to knock on their door and tell them to do things. I apologized because what else could I do and he said, ""You don't get it do you?"" And proceeded to storm off in a huff. I didn't know that it was because somebody died, I didn't tell them turn it off and when it is so loud that you have to leave the room to hear me ask to turn it down, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to turn it down.

They make me uncomfortable and worried for my possessions and pets safety, they're gross, and they're annoying. My cousins and their toddler are here for the hurricane. I'm trying to get my mind off things and play some Zelda. I'm alone, actually enjoying this nightmare for a moment. Then everyone else comes in. Of course for the millionth time the rugrat tunnel visions on the TV and heads for the dock. Shit kept making me nervous, kid kept climbing the entertainment center trying to grab the dock. The mom kept pulling him away and saying ""No, don't touch that. You'll play it in a little bit."" I'm super uncomfortable. I hate the kid, but I can't hate him because I love my cousins. I try to just deal with it but I can't. My anxiety, irritation, and awkwardness is up. So I just pop it off the dock and leave the room after the mom said he could play. I never planned to put any part of my electric baby into the hands of their human one. As I was walking out she said ""We can just play a game on my phone"" which made me feel like an asshole but at the same time I feel like she shouldn't volunteer other people's expensive prized possessions to be a child's chew toy.

Alternatively, she could've just been lying to her kid. Young children are easily distracted.

Ignore the toddler but if I were you I'd try to apologize to your cousin and explain your motives so she understands.  I'm sure she's having a harder time than you trying to keep stress down and her kid in check (imagine trying to wrangle a toddler during a situation like this, I feel bad for her).",Human
6z8nyu,"Yeah, you are an asshole.

Your cousins are fleeing a hurricane, and the least you could do is try to make them a little comfortable.  I mean, its very possible they could be heading home to their house destroyed or flooded.  

There are lots of ways you could have handled this, for example by putting away expensive things you didn't want the toddler touching before they arrived, by playing video games with the kid or saying something like ""I'm sorry, that's not for children, let's put that in the other room and we can play something else together"" and then gone and played cards or watched a cartoon with the toddler.

I think the biggest issue here isn't the Switch explicitly, I get not wanting a toddler to break something expensive.  Rather, its the fact that you aren't being very hospitable to a family member during a time of need.  Think about the stress and worry your relatives are going through right now, and try and do something that will hopefully make them a little more comfortable.

Parents of uncontrollable children tend to be incredibly irresponsible and won't reimburse for damage done by crotchfruit.  Amazingly, I've also seen that parents of well-behaved children tend to be very sorry and willing to reimburse when their children do damage.  

So take note.  The problem is not just the rugrat - it's also the mother.  Keep a watchful eye on her; she will likely neglect her annoying child and refuse to take responsibility when it inevitably fucks up.

I don't understand why you describe this absolutely routine interaction in such dramatic terms.  Kid enters house that is normally kidless... Host suddenly realizes just how many breakable and/or dangerous items are in the kids reach and starts madly dashing around securing stuff.  Very normal.

Is there a room, like your bedroom, that you can make off limits to the kid so your pets can take refuge there and you can stick valuable posessions there?  You are right to worry about your pets and possessions so it is good to have a secure area.

6zah5o,"Key word is on acting.

I'm extremely introverted, I hate people. I hate social interaction. But when I'm forced into a situation where I have to be social, I'm very good at acting.

Now when I'm with my girlfriend I'm no recluse, but I'm real. I enjoy talking to her and I feel open with her, but after almost 3 years together there's really not much to talk about. We know pretty much everything about each other and can pretty much just know what the other is thinking. I'm not a recluse with her, I'm just much more quiet and communicate more physically (I'm constantly hugging and kissing her and generally giving her affection which she loves) than verbally. Simply because there's not really much to say other than how our days were and the 2-3 interesting things we find out that day. I can stretch but there's really not much to talk about and I do feel like all the pressure is on me to make interesting conversation beyond the mundane ""hey look there's an x over there""

Either way she usually gets pretty upset when she sees me in a situation where I'm acting social. I'm up front with her and tell her ""yeah I'm basically performing here"" and she still gets pretty upset. I don't really see how she can justify getting mad at me over it when most of these times she's the one forcing me into these social situations that I act friendly in. She fully knows I'd rather be at home cuddling with her but she still acts somewhat jealous at me more or less pretending to be social and friendly",Human
6zah5o,"Maybe, then, this just...isn't the right relationship. It seems fairly clear that she does in fact prefer the 'acting' you to the real you. And honestly, I can't blame her for that.

Even if it's your girlfriend, clamming up and making only the bare bones of conversation...isn't really on. I also find it really difficult to talk to people, even those I'm close with like my family. I'd prefer to sit in silence.

Forcing yourself to be sociable and talk to people means you put in *effort* for them, and your girlfriend clearly isn't seeing you put in a lot of effort for her. Maybe it's your 'real self' in that it's easiest for you, but my 'real self' is a person who sleeps till noon, does no work, responds only with sarcastic comments, and subsists solely on baked potatoes and root beer....that's not the 'real self' I want anyone, including my family, to see. When I'm cleaned up and dressed in not-pajamas and putting on a smile for the world, I am in essence faking, but that's how life works. No one wants to be around lazy real-me, people want to be around kind-of-real-me, that puts in the effort without compromising the personality.

Relationships take effort. By refusing to put in the effort to really *talk* to her, you're signaling that she's not worth that amount of social effort...that your other friends *are* worth that effort and she isn't.

&gt; Okay, if you really want me to, I can make the same effort to be social and talkative with you ... but I'll be faking it and I'll be miserable the whole time. So you can get the interactions you want with me, but it'll hurt you even more because you know I hate it. Do you want me to do that?

**Your ""offer"" is one that is a lose-lose for her either way.**

- is hurt that you're willing to make an effort to be outgoing with other people, when you *aren't* willing to make the same effort with her.

I don't know if it comes down to him being introverted vs me extroverted, sex differences, just our personality, whatever.

I didn't tell him of mine, however, he had to cancel his so he made his early Saturday which is totally fine. 

The group got confused because for them they wondered if we decided to make it the SAME event because they didn't know I was like trying to distance myself from this guy. But it ended up being where he had a little get together then everyone went to mine yet I told him he cannot show up at my house, I told him why I'm mad at him and like if he doesn't want to change or even consider what he did was wrong then there won't be next time, but I told him do NOT show up at my house. 

He tried getting my other friend to drive him, because this other friend called me asking what he should say to my friend because he had a full car. So, I told him like, ""no don't drive him"".

But he was flat out told not to come. So coming anyways and expecting the person who told you not to come to just let you in anyways is both arrogant and asshole behaviour.

I'd be willing to say they're both being assholes, but while it may fit within the 'rules' for OP to turn him away per previous agreement, the fact that he was an ass for showing up uninvited doesn't absolve OP of being an asshole by turning a 'friend' away in front of everyone.

So, friend 1then meets up with  another mutual friend and decides to use his struggle as a conversation starter.

It wasn't like, ""oh we should help him"" it was more just to talk about him and my friend talks about people a lot. Friend 1 ended up telling people this friend who was mad at him was a bad person. He also occasionally like we'd hang out and if he'd talk to someone he'd either say like im shy or he'd talk to them not introduce me but then when I start talking he'd try to butt in again.

The main chatroom is used for talking and sharing links and stuff, and occasional political debate. My friend and I are both Authoritarian Rights, and there are a lot of other people on other sides of the political compass. There is also a lot of in-fighting, with gossip and insulting people behind their backs. I like almost everyone at first, unless they come out as a complete asshole, so I automatically thought everyone there was decent, and defended them if things got too rough. I never ratted anyone out, however.

(Real Story): A couple of people on the chatroom were saying things like ""taxation is theft"" and other things. I joined in the conversation, with my usual banter. Things were pretty civil, and I learned a few things from them. This goes on for a couple weeks to a month, and they seem a little annoyed, so I stop, even though they continue to talk about politics. This made me a little mad, but it didn't stop me from participating in the chat. I didn't debate, but I continued to post memes and stuff, some of which were political, but nothing insulting.

Then, a couple hours ago, I get back from vacation and notice that I can't find the chatroom anywhere. I talked to my good friend, who I know personally, and he says I was kicked. His side of the story is that everyone else ""didn't like i",Human
6zcj33,"I think they're a little bit assholish for not telling you or asking you to stop before they decided to kick you. Maybe you screwed up and debated too much, maybe you didn't...but if they had a problem with it they should have told you outright instead of just kicking you from it.

I don't think you're an asshole. If the discussion is turned to politics naturally people will debate, and it's on them to respond to things they don't like as mature human beings, and talk it out with you. Now, if they'd asked you to stop and you'd persisted, you'd be an asshole...but you can't be expected to change your behavior when no one tells you your behavior is a problem for them.

The worst thing you are is *maybe* lacking in social cues to be able to tell they didn't like the conversation about politics. They're assholes for not messaging you privately and talking to you.",Human
6zcj33,"The thing is, they just didn't like MY opinion. Everyone else was able to keep debating, but I was excluded",Human
6zcj33,"Yeah, I got that? I agree that they're being assholes. If they exclude you they need to give you a reason for it and talk it over with you.

I didn't see the conversation...I have no idea what your posts to them were. But even if you *were* excessively debating like they said you were, they're still assholes for blocking you without an attempt to talk it out first.",Human
6zcj33,Yeah. Now all but 2 have completely discommunicated me.,Human

How are you supposed to fix something you didn't know was a problem? It's like getting annoyed at someone for having spinach in their teeth. ",Human
6zcj33,"If your description is accurate, then they are definitely the assholes. 

My only comment is that maybe your description might not show both sides of the story (to be fair, no one EVER accurately presents both sides of a story they're in). Told from their perspective, this story might sound very different. 

However, unless you omitted something really egregious, they are still the assholes for cutting you out without even talking to you about their issues. 

I know this won't make it suck any less for you, but these don't sound like the best folks ever. Even your friend didn't tell you directly, it sounds like; instead he said nothing until you asked what happened. 

That is NOT a thing a good friend does ... thinking you're meeting friends for a party, only to show up and find out they all ditched you, is a *horrible* feeling. A real friend would spare you that experience by being upfront with you.

6zczgb,"You're definitely not an asshole.  In fact, I think you're the opposite of an asshole, you're a good friend.  I came to the realization in my twenties that one of the functions of a good friend is to point out when I was being a dick.  I've come down hard on a couple of friends in the past; for instance, one buddy telling me how he drunkenly vandalized this guys car (the guy WAS kind of a dick), and another time a friend was thrilled that he managed to score a free $400 laptop because the clerk at Best Buy was confused and overwhelmed on Black Friday.  

I've also been set straight in no uncertain terms by friends, mainly for what was a charming habit of making snarky comments about things my friends were excited about because I don't know why; maybe because, ""I'm so smart, I know better"".  Ugh, cringe.  In all these instances the basic approach was, ""That's fucked up, you need to stop doing that/make it right"".  Hearing it from a friend whose opinion you value and respect really cuts through excuses and rationalizations.  The right friends help you learn to be a better person.

Also, I don't think friend number one is an asshole.  Everybody does stupid shit when they're drunk.  He went out of his way to make it right, though, by returning the bike.

6zemdd,"You are **absolutely not the asshole.**

I don't think people understand the actual scam and are treating the ""second deal"" as a legit deal, rather than a planned part of the scam. 

I think the ""second deal"" for a partial refund was a desired outcome of the scam (if not *the* preferred outcome, which is probably to get away with selling the fakes full price). 

I base this on: 

- the immediate confession without explanation (rules out innocent mistake or remorseful attempted fraudster) 

- the immediate suggestion of a ""resolution"" that lets the seller profit, leaves the victim with an unwanted product, and prevents ebay from finding out about the fraud 

- the seller's response to learning that you informed ebay of the facts is consistent with a scammer trying to preserve a scam (rather than a good faith seller, who would have been expected to argue that you accepted a LEGIT ""second deal"" and were unfairly canceling it)

This scammer is a smart one - and probably gets most people to accept the partial refund like you initially did, leaving him free to continue scamming.   

**Unsuccessful, Short-Lived Scammer** 

- list real product for $110
- collect $110, deliver fake product 
- upon being accused of scam by victim, offer full refund for return of shoes - maybe even throw in a few bucks for shipping. 

Possible Financial Outcomes of Each Scam:

- scammer gets $110 
- scammer gets $0

- short duration (victim compla",Human
6zemdd,"I think the ""second deal"" WAS the actual scam. 

If so, you're saying that OP was an asshole for not playing into the scam as expected. 

If so, OP is NOT in any way the asshole. 

&gt; You're the asshole. First, you effectively stole from him. He may have deserved it, but it's not your position to ""fine"" him the extra $65 you got and he lost. 

OP **didn't** fine him. 

OP deprived scammer of any benefit of the scam - benefit that was maliciously obtained at OP's expense. 


It is completely appropriate for someone in OP's position to act so as to ensure that a confirmed scammer does not benefit from the scam in any way. 

I personally see nothing morally wrong with, limiting yourself to the ""situation of the scam,"" additionally attempting to collect up to the amount of money the scammer initially collected from you. 

e.g., scammer's price on original fraudulent transaction was $110, I think victim is not the asshole for: 
- getting back $110 paid to scammer
- attempting to collect up to an additional $110 from scammer

This is based on a routine and reasonable approach to calculating damages. 

Let's say OP complained to ebay and returned the fakes for a full refund. That $110 **does not** fully compensate OP for damages caused by scammer: 

- scammer directly cost OP time (reporting issue to ebay, following up, shipping back shoes) 

- scammer indirectly cost OP time and other inconveniences (shoe purchase was time-sensitive, scammer caused OP to forego legit purchase opt",Human
6zemdd,not the asshole! ,Human
6zemdd,"How is the second deal a scam? OP had the shoes in his possession and chose to ""buy"" them for the $65 he didn't have refunded. There's no scam there. OP has the chance to examine the shoes and decided they were worth the price. He only changed his mind after the fact. 

Assuming the full refund goes through, the scammer gains nothing, other than the effectively $0 time value of the money. I can see OP keeping a small amount of the $65, whatever matches the return shipping costs.

No matter what, OP entered into a valid agreement with the scammer to keep the shoes for a discounted price, then broke that agreement.",Human
6zemdd,"I edited my other comment with same info, don't need to have it cluttering up the thread. 

But short answer: 

The ""second deal"" *wasn't* a valid agreement because it wasn't entered into honestly or fairly - the second deal was *itself* a direct, intended result of the scammer's fraud. 

As a result, it's not binding on OP the same way that a *legitimate* deal would have been. 

So, say the shoes had been authentic but had been a different color than ordered for some non-fraudulent reason (like seller ran out of the right color and this was the only option). If OP had agreed to some sort of partial refund to keep the shoes - then your analysis of his subsequent actions would be completely correct. ",Human
6zemdd,"Why do you say he is a bit of an asshole if he keeps the money? 

And why is keeping the money relevant?  

If OP is an asshole here, it's because of the impact of his actions on the scammer - whether those actions were ""fair"" to the scammer under the circumstances. 

So if OP somehow acted unfairly towards the scammer, then that unfair action isn't undone by OP later doing something good for someone else - the consequences for the scammer don't change. ",Human
6zemdd,"Well as I understand it, he's getting the full price back from eBay and the 65 from the scammer, so he's coming out 65 ahead, right? Which means if they keep the money, they become a scammer themselves. In this case, I would be inclined to keep the money myself, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a scam. It's fighting assholeness with assholeness. Like I say, I'd probably do it too, but still. ",Human
6zemdd,"
Thanks for explaining :) 

&gt; Which means if they keep the money, they become a scammer themselves. 

Scamming implies dishonest intent at the time of acting. 

Taking OP's description at face value, that didn't exist. Theft is potentially fair, but not scam. 

I say ""not an asshole"" in context because I think assholeness in a situation is relative - it's not a judgment on your actions in isolation, but whether, relative to the other party, you're **""THE asshole.""**

OP didn't actively set out to scam this guy... scammer acted fraudulent in setting up this situation, and OP simply took advantage of it instead of playing the victim as scammer intended him to do. 

&gt; Like I say, I'd probably do it too, but still. 

And I'd say you're not the asshole either. Not an angel, but definitely not the asshole.  :P ",Human

My middle sister, who is three and a half years younger announced her engagement. Her and I have had a pretty tumultuous relationship to say the least, and about 7 years ago we mutually decided to cut one another out of each other's lives completely.

Some things to think about ... 

1. When you say you really wouldn't regret missing your sister's wedding, does that *also* mean you really wouldn't regret hurting your parents so badly? 

The fact that you're asking this sounds like you would. 

Your parents still love her, and you still love them. Think about what you'd be taking away from them - the entire experience will be painful instead of joyful, from wedding preparations to the wedding day, to every time they think about it. 

What will going cost you - *really* cost you - compared to what your not going will really cost your parents?

I was invited but didn't go to my brother's wedding over 15 years ago. On reflection, I now wish I had. It doesn't fill me with regret, I don't spend time thinking about it, but if I had the opportunity to make the decision again, I would go.

If your sister wants to be right, she won't invite you. If she wants to be kind, she will. Then it's up to you to decide what you want to be.

It sounds like you were both assholes in the past, but if you don't try to patch things up, you may regret it.

Keep the big picture in mind; you're family and we're all a bunch of collections of space dust trying to find meaning, connection, and belonging.  If she stole your favorite cd, or fucked your boyfriend or whatever, it's in the past.

2. She's hoping you don't show up, but wanted to pretend (to herself, her parents, whoever) that's she's the bigger person.

Since you haven't seen her in 7 years, there's really no way to know for SURE which it is, but you probably have a better guess than we do.

I mean, it sort of depends on why you cut her out of your life, doesn't it?

Did she murder your dog and isn't sorry?  Don't go, regardless.  Doesn't matter what your parents think, or anyone else thinks.  You can't show up and pretend to be happy for someone that is unrepentant like that.

But I'm guessing it's not so clear cut as that?  Do you have specific crimes against you that she has committed, that you could summarize in a few minutes to someone?  Or you just don't like her because she's generally rude or selfish or whatever?  Vague personality conflicts?

Or maybe you don't like her because you're kind of a jerk and she calls you out on it, and so you don't want to see for that reason.  I mean, you didn't give us any clues here.

6zmqmm,"So I finally got my dad to throw away a lot of old furniture that is either broke, outdated or just taking up space. there was a fair bit of stuff to throw away and so I hired a skip to dispose of this waste.

So there I was today, putting all the rubbish into my skip, when he he asks if he can put his rubbish in my skip. 
Just to reiterate, there is enough stuff in his garden that it wouldn't fit in 2 trucks. A LOT of shit. 
I say I don't think there will be room because there is a lot of furniture to go in the skip and he responds saying ""but they don't charge by weight for the skip"" (which is true). I then simply told him no because I felt he was holding on to his shit, just to dump it in someone else skip to save a few quid. He gave me a look and walked away muttering something, and so I continued. 

When I was finished, the skip was reasonably full, but on the lower end. There was definitely room for more stuff, but not his entire collection. Maybe a quarter. I said nothing and the skip was collected today.

You should just have told the neighbour that he could use the unused space once you were done filling the skip with your own stuff, as long as he didn't overload it.  ""Not everything you have will fit, but if you want to put a few things on there, go ahead.  Just don't overload it.""",Human
6zmqmm,Yeah I think it was more the fact that he was hoarding until he could get rid of his stuff for free that got to me. I do see your point though. I tend to see the worst in people. Thanks for your input.,Human
6zmqmm,"He probably wasn't intentionally hoarding it (although I can't rule that out) - he probably just saw an opportunity to deal with a problem he'd been procrastinating about.

In any event, even if you're right, you can help him with his problem (and help him see the best in people - right now he probably sees the worst in you, unfortunately) and he'll still have a big problem to solve even if you did help him.",Human
6zmqmm,Yeah that's true. I guess I will see if he does order a skip for himself and that will give me my answer haha,Human
6zmqmm,"I don't think either of you are in the wrong here. You probably should have let him fill the remaining space once you were done, but you didn't owe it to him. He probably shouldn't have put it off for so long and offer to toss you a few bucks to cover the cost of the skip, but it wasn't out of the line to ask.

You both could have been more neighborly. That's about the worst I can say.",Human
6zmqmm,"Yeah I admit I could have been nicer. I've been living in my dads place for about 2 years and the only times I've talked to him is when he's asking for something, which is why my mind automatically went to the thought of him scourging. 
I'm glad you don't think i'm a complete cunt xD",Human
6zmqmm,Yeah of you had extra room which was already paid for then that means you spent money to keep it empty instead of helping him out a little bit.  You were not wrong in telling him you didn't think there was going to be room but when you saw there was room and didn't tell him you crossed over into A-hole territory.  He probably doesn't want to be a hoarder.  Maybe you could tell him how much it would cost for him to get one and let him know the company you used.  Maybe even make the call for him.,Human
6zmqmm,"Did he offer to pay? If yes, then you're kind of an asshole. ",Human
6zmqmm,"Nah, you're not being a cunt. We've all had those neighbors that aren't actively shitty or anything but they get under your skin. One thing I always keep in mind is, if trouble happens, these are people you need in your corner. Someone to ask the weird guy lingering in your driveway wtf they're doing, to call 911 if there's a fire, to be cool when a storm takes out a tree in your yard and knocks down part of the fence. So I'm not inviting them to a barbecue or anything but I'll smile and wave when I see them and humor them when they complain about people turning around in their driveway or whatever dumbass axe they're grinding. ",Human
6zmqmm,No he didn't offer anything. ,Human
6zmqmm,"I think asshole is a bit strong but that IS the name of the sub so yeah, you're kind of an asshole. A good compromise would have been to say ""Hey, let me finish up with my junk and if there is any space left you can add to it.""",Human
6zmqmm,"If he had come to you and asked, """"Can I put these one or two things in your skip,""    Or said to you, ""Can I fill up any left over space when you are done, I'll pay for the space,""   you would have been inclined to say yes.   When he just asks for permission to indiscriminately fill up the skip you paid for, then you were justified to say NO.",Human
6zmqmm,The neighborly thing to do would be to say he could fill it up AFTER you were done but he also has no right to claim use of your dumpster so it wasn't nice of you but it wasn't a total jerk move. I'd say you were unfriendly. ,Human
6zmqmm,I don't think you are an asshole here. You paid for a service. He did not. Why is it expected that he should be able to take advantage of a service that you paid for? ,Human
6zmqmm,You were kind of an asshole but clearly you're learning.,Human
6zmqmm,I don't think so.,Human

6zmqmm,"I don't think you're the asshole

Many times before I've had people dump their rubbish in places they shouldn't. I get that it was piling up on his land and if it was really there for about a year then he should've done something about it sooner. Since he didn't, it sure looked like he was trying to pawn off his rubbish on you for an easy way out.",Human
6zmqmm,"Nope, just unfriendly. You paid for a service, you choose how that service gets used. 

Now would I let a neighbor use it? Depends, do I know his name and greet whenever we see each other, or can I count the amount of times I've had interaction with them on one hand?",Human

6znry1,"I don't mean at all to phrase the title sarcastically or like I'm the good guy or anything. My roommate will ask me to do various things around the house like clean or do dishes or laundry. She's a bit on the lazy side, so more often than not it's me who ends up doing these things, but I don't have a problem with it because I don't have a job and I feel a sense of responsibility to help her out as much as possible when I can. 

The problem is sometimes I'll forget a step and make a mistake with what she wants me to do, because I didn't hear her or I forgot or whatever, which will prompt her to start yelling at me that I never listen and that she doesn't matter to me etc. And she'll inevitably ask ""honestly do you think I'm asking you to do too much? Because I know I'm lazy. You can tell me"".  To which I always respond no it's no trouble. 

So the other day we're having this conversation again, and I say ""you do kinda ask me to do more than our other roommates do, but I don't say anything because I want to make your life easier"". She storms off from the conversation and later I overhear her crying to our other roommate about how I'm a liar and she can't trust anything I tell her. Am I the asshole? And is there anything I can do to make this whole situation better?

As far as anything you can do to make it better, that's a tall order with unreasonable people, but don't let her treat you like shit. Habitually shitty people target those who won't stand up to them.

- she treats you like shit by yelling at and berating you without justification (and while you're helping her)

- she specifically tells you its okay to be honest with her in answering her question, then blows up when you honestly (and nicely) answer her question

- she tells at least one other person that you're an untrustworthy liar because you were honest with her

She's wildly immature, selfish, and has a hell of a mean streak.

My bf and I have moviepass, a $10/month subscription that allows you to see one movie a day. It's not free but it's super cheap. He offered to let a friend and the friend's daughter use mine and his to go see a movie.  These people are poor and homeless, but the guy has a job. He didn't ask me if this was ok. I've got issues with people using my stuff or volunteering my stuff without asking, I find it disrespectful. But instead of articulating this like a person who is quick on their feet, I said that I work hard for stuff like this, if they want moviepass they can afford it themselves, it's cheap. I was definitely an asshole at that moment.

If I had been asked in advance if they could use it, I'd have said yes. I need to be asked because I do work hard for everything I have, not respecting that really upsets me. Bf, on the other hand, gives people money and offers to help with things so much that his friends joke about it. And he's not exactly rich. 

So he's now called the things I said cold, ugly, and horrible. He thinks this is serious enough to break up over and idk what the fuck to do. Am I the asshole?

It's not about sharing or whether the people are poor, or whether your BF is so generous he gives things away that aren't his, it's about respect like you said.

You want your BF to acknowledge that you are making his generosity possible.  

I feel the same sort of protectiveness about some things which are mine, which I'd freely share if asked, but if you take things without asking, it makes my mind race to ""what else are you going to just take from me without asking?"" 

My wife's sister will come over and just help herself to the cookies on my shelf.  If asked, I'd give her enough cookies to make her sick, but when she does it without asking, it feels like she's a selfish inconsiderate slob, and I'm a doormat.

Having said that, if you were not using the ticket for that day, why kick a fuss? Just inform him that you would like to be asked before hand if it's okay, just incase you want to use this service that you pay for. This is the reason you are the asshole.

Then you get to choose how those luxuries are used, when, and if anyone else can partake. You didn't refuse drinking water during a flood, or shelter during a blizzard to these homeless people. You refused a luxury that you work for. 

No one ""needs"" to go to the movies to survive, so you are not an asshole. Not everyone deserves to have a Wagyu steak, new car, or watch the latest movies. That's for winners.

Either way, there is no denying that he took her property and gave it away without her knowledge. This is technically theft regardless of the cost of the item and so, he is an asshole.",Human
6zsnbf,"Because generally two people in a relationship communicate like adults and they know each other's schedule decently well. 

A place to live is a necessity, and since we are trying to draw ACCURATE comparisons, I'd be cool with it for a day, since that's all she was out of in terms of movies, especially when it's a father trying to make his child happy. Especially if I knew this person as well. My friends are my family. If they need help, and I can provide said help? I'm fucking there. So maybe I have a bias, but your scenario is nothing like the situation above. 

A human can survive with food, water, and shelter. But it's not a pleasant experience. I can tell you from experience. So while yes, he should have asked, her overreaction was heartless. She went on how she earned the movie pass and it was hers, over being out of ONE DAY, over someone else trying to make being homeless and poor suck less. That's pretty fucking heartless right there, at least on the surface. 

If I had heard that come from someone, I'd probably think they're a shitty person. But, the thing is, I get where she's coming from. Her stuff is hers. She's not heartless, she was hurt he didn't ask. But the thing about hurt is, you say some fucked shit while you're hurt and then you have to live with those consequences. 

So while I'm sure OP is a fantastic person otherwise, her words were heartless and she was an asshole. And it's definitely not theft. ",Human

I'm also getting asshole vibes from what seems to be you insulting your boyfriend for being too generous with his money and time.

I get it, I don't like people not checking with me about shit like this first either, but you reacted like an asshole and it kind of sounds like you're still being one. Just tell your boyfriend you're sorry, for fuck's sake.

EDIT: Ah, I can see you already did tell him you're sorry, my bad. I don't know what else to say for advice. Your boyfriend is possibly also being an asshole for not letting it go, but without knowing his side it's hard to say.",Human
6zsnbf,"You have a valid point. However, most people don't become homeless out of thin air, irrelevant to the current topic though.

6zsnbf,"If you saw my post, I said she wasn't an asshole. It's not her responsibility to provide that win.

Your statement that steak and luxuries are for winners just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I mean, If you've got extra steaks (Movie tickets) you're not using because you're a winner, why not give them away (Terms and conditions state this is not allowed. I understand.) to those less fortunate?

Granted, There's a very clear contract argument to be made against giving away these steaks (Movie tickets) which makes OP not an asshole but saying that steaks are only for winners doesn't sit well with me. Especially considering how many pounds of food Americans waste every year.",Human
6zsnbf,"Oh, I'm just saying in general. As in response to my ""Steaks are for winners"" comment. 

And yes, extra steaks could be given away to those less fortunate. Or not. They're not your steaks, or mine. They're OPs. Why should OP be ""expected"" to give away those steaks?

And I see what you mean, I meant it more as an expensive item that while being food, is not necessary at all for a healthy person and is a clear luxury. Unlike potable water during a weather disaster. 100% agree on the waste comment. ",Human
6zsnbf,"&gt; Why should OP be ""expected"" to give away those steaks?

OP should not be and OP was put in the position of 'being expected to' by her boyfriend. I'll be the first to admit I'm somewhat of a bleeding heart. I go back to the phrase 'Misfortune nobly borne is good fortune."" OP could've simply said 'Ah, fuck it. Someone benefited with little to no loss on my part. No skin off my back.""

She could never lend them a ticket again and even when asked directly just say 'Boyfriend likes to do stuff like that but I don't feel comfortable giving away my ticket.'

There's two sides to this. Socially, we all pretend to be altruistic. So when confronted with an obviously selfish (but honest) statement, everyone tends to react negatively. Now, 80% of people probably at one point or another say something akin to 'I've got mine, They should get theirs' about something or another. OP gave her boyfriend the 'Good guy' aura but I picked up on him being fast and loose with money and decision making. He wants to help people but he expects someone who shares those values. He may want to live a life of poverty, rich in social capital and that's fine for him.

The other side is that outside of the obvious contract violation, OP suffers none from giving away the ticket. It's technically a 'good' deed with no apparent damages to her. Again, declining this is not a 'bad' deed, it's just neutral, since agreeing to it is a 'bad' deed in regards to her agreement with Moviepass.

Humans are social creat",Human
6zsnbf,"So you're saying that communication is how he knew she didn't want the ticket, yet he didn't ask if she was using the ticket? sorry I think it's way more likely he didn't know and just assumed she would be okay with it. 

Honestly the only difference I see between my comparison is the price. Her over reaction wasn't heartless because it was not triggered by the ticket going to someone who could use it, but instead by the fact that she had no input into her property being given away. Like she said, she wouldn't have had a problem if she was asked. So I feel that your explanation about the horrors of living rough is irreverent in this situation. 

Regardless of how you look at it, the ticket was hers. He took something that belonged to her, and gave it away without permission. Would you not think these are the actions of an asshole?",Human
6zsnbf,"Or he thought he knew her well enough and assumed. Not defending him, just trying to be fair. He was still wrong. Never will say otherwise. 

That's because you probably have a bloated sense of value towards your property, to where a day of missing a movie is equivalent to someone living in your home for a week in your eyes. And like I said, her words were pretty heartless. Not saying she is, I thought I made that pretty clear. She did something we're all guilty of and said hurtful shit while hurt. Just because she's now calmed down and explained it doesn't mean those words disappear. I destroyed a few relationships because I said stupid shit while I was angry or hurting. Just because she would be okay with it if he asked doesn't mean her words were okay. It doesn't make them less heartless and less of an asshole move. 

I never said he wasn't an asshole. He isn't the person whose being discussed. He was an asshole. There. Now answer me why it's okay for an adult to throw a tantrum. You know how I treat people like that? Like toddlers. She has a right to be hurt. She doesn't get to turn around and say ""but this is really why"" and everything is magically absolved. Me saying ""I didn't mean that"" doesn't change the ugliness I said. We have to deal with the consequences of our actions.

And if you say anything else about her boyfriend being an asshole as some justification, you're not getting any response because someone being an asshole doesn't justify further assholery. ",Human
6zsnbf,"Then he was wrong to assume. I'm not taking his side on this because he's wrong as well. I see your side of it, and if wishes were real, well, neither of us would have to worry about snap responses causing lasting issues.

I would consider them heartless, because this is a friend (I'm assuming your friend as well as his), and your response seems like he should of let them go fuck themselves.

It’s totally understandable you’re second-guessing yourself, it’s a stressful situation. But honestly, the seller’s behavior was pretty dismissive. Etsy’s case process is there for a reason – to help buyers like you when things go wrong. 

Don't feel bad about opening the case. You provided evidence, she wasn't responsive, and you’re running out of time to resolve it. Etsy will likely investigate and hopefully mediate a solution. It’s better to have a record of your attempt to resolve it directly with the seller, and it's smart to leverage Etsy’s support before your window closes. Go for it – you've done the right thing!",Gemma3_4b
4czypu,"From your post, it sounds like you've been quite patient and reasonable throughout this situation, reaching out to the seller multiple times before involving Etsy. The seller's response, however, seems unprofessional and disregards your concerns as a customer.

In terms of reporting her to Etsy, it is understandable that you might feel frustrated and hesitant about making this decision. However, given the lack of communication from the seller and the deteriorating situation with your window for opening an Etsy case closing in, it seems like a reasonable step to take.

If you've attempted to work things out with the seller, provided clear photos and information about the issue, and she has failed to address the problem within a reasonable timeframe, then there is nothing wrong with reporting her to Etsy. This way, you may get your case resolved quickly and efficiently, ensuring that you receive the replacement or refund you deserve.

In conclusion, although it's never ideal to report someone, especially considering the rapport we typically aim for in online marketplaces, it seems like opening a case with Etsy might be the best course of action given the circumstances. It is always important to weigh your options and choose the path that aligns best with your goals while keeping a fair and reasonable approach.",Dolphin-Mistral

Firstly, communication is key in any relationship. It seems like there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the timeframe when he was going to bring back the car. It might be worthwhile for both of you to sit down and discuss what each of you expected from this situation. You can then try to come up with a compromise or establish some ground rules for future borrowings.

Secondly, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and sometimes we trust people more than we should. If your boyfriend is genuinely remorseful about his actions and understands why you're upset, he may be willing to make amends by doing something special or thoughtful for you as a way of apologizing.

Lastly, it's essential to take responsibility for our own actions in any relationship. While it might feel like the blame is solely on your boyfriend, I think it's also helpful to reflect on why you let him borrow the car in the first place and whether or not there are some boundaries you need to establish going forward.

It's important, though, to consider how your girlfriend perceives these messages. Even if the content of the messages is loving and thoughtful, she may still be able to sense that they're not truly coming from you in the moment. This could potentially have a negative impact on your relationship over time, as your girlfriend may feel disconnected or unappreciated.

I recommend discussing this experience with your dentist to express your feelings openly. This could help clarify her intentions and might prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Furthermore, you can always seek out a different dental professional if you are uncomfortable continuing with your current one.

As for your mental health and wellbeing, it is crucial to address these concerns as well.

If you find yourself facing higher tipping expectations or struggling with adjusting to this change, one approach could be to factor in an 18% or 20% increase into your initial budget when dining out or using services where tipping is customary. This way, you'll already have a sense of how much you should spend, and you can focus on enjoying the experience without feeling too stressed about the final bill.

It may take some time and effort to find the right rhythm, but it's worthwhile for building a strong foundation in your relationship.",Dolphin-Mistral
4dswx1,"Okay, wow – thanks for sharing this honestly. It’s *super* common to feel this way, seriously. You’re definitely not alone! It’s incredibly overwhelming how much information is constantly thrown at us, and honestly, feeling like you can tune out politics is a totally valid reaction. 

It sounds like you’re recognizing that you don't *want* to engage with that level of constant debate, and that's perfectly okay. A lot of people feel the same way – it can feel draining and pointless. 

The thing is, you don't *have* to follow every single political detail to be a good, engaged citizen. You can absolutely prioritize your own well-being and mental health. 

Instead of feeling like you’re “pathetic,” maybe think about it as choosing to focus on things you *do* care about.  There are plenty of ways to stay informed without getting bogged down in the drama.  

If you ever *do* want to dip your toe in, there are tons of really good, non-partisan resources out there that break things down simply. Just don't feel pressured to follow everything!  Glad you spoke up – it's good to hear you're being honest about how you feel.",Gemma3_4b
4dswx1,"Hello! It's great that you have a unique perspective on life and politics, but please understand that not everyone shares your viewpoint. It's important for all of us to engage in discussions about current events, even if we don't agree with every detail or aspect of the conversation.

While it might seem like an unnecessary waste of time to some, engaging in political discourse can help individuals develop critical thinking skills and broaden their understanding of the world around them. It also allows people to form opinions based on factual information rather than hearsay or misinformation.

Moreover, not everyone feels indifferent about politics. For many, it is an essential part of their daily lives, as they work hard to make a difference in their communities and ensure that the voices of all citizens are heard. While your way of life might be fulfilling for you, others may find that staying informed on political matters helps them feel more connected to society and contributes to meaningful change.

In conclusion, it's entirely understandable that some people choose not to engage with politics or news. However, it is also essential to recognize the value of these conversations for others and respect their choices to participate or remain uninformed.",Dolphin-Mistral
4dsxyk,"Okay, wow, that sounds like a really terrifying and stressful situation. Seriously, my heart is racing just reading about it! You absolutely do *not* deserve to be hit like that, and it’s completely understandable why you’re questioning whether you were at fault.

Honestly, based on what you’ve described, the person making the illegal U-turn is *definitely* the asshole here. Signaling is crucial for maneuvers like that, and doing it without warning is incredibly dangerous. It's a completely reckless action, and you were simply a victim of their negligence.

You're probably feeling a lot of guilt and self-doubt, but don't beat yourself up. You reacted to a sudden, unexpected, and illegal maneuver. 

As for where to get more advice, r/legaladvice is a good starting point, but they can't offer legal opinions. r/cars is also a great place to discuss driving situations and get other people's perspectives. 

I'm really sorry this happened to you. Focus on your well-being and make sure you’re okay.  Do you have any idea if there's police involvement or if you should contact them?",Gemma3_4b
4dsxyk,"I'm sorry to hear about your incident, and I understand that you must be feeling frustrated and upset. Let's break down what happened to better understand the situation:

1. The person cut you off and pulled over to the right side of the road. This was a risky move, as it could have resulted in an accident if someone had not noticed them. However, since they were on a big enough road, it seems like their intention might have been to make a legal turn at some point.

2. You decided to pass them on the left side, assuming they were going to stop or turn. This was a reasonable assumption, but as you discovered, they actually decided to make an illegal U-turn from the right side of the road without using their turn signal.

3. As a result of this unexpected action, you ended up hitting the back side of their driver's side. This is unfortunate and could have been avoided if the other person had signaled their intention or chosen a safer location to make the U-turn.

Given these details, it seems like both parties share some responsibility in this situation:

- The other person was reckless by making an illegal U-turn without proper warning. This could have caused accidents or injuries to you and others on the road.
  
- You assumed they were stopping or turning and decided to pass them without checking for their intention. This was a risky move, and while it may not be entirely your fault that an accident occurred, it certainly contributed to the situation.

In conclusion, I would say both of you share some blame in this unfortunate incident. To prevent such situations from happening again, I recommend:

- Always double-check what other drivers are doing on the road before making any sudden maneuvers.
  
- Be more patient and cautious when driving, especially in busy or unfamiliar areas.
  
- When turning, always use your turn signal to give other drivers a clear indication of your intention.
  
Remember that accidents can happen to anyone, but by being more mindful and considerate of other drivers on the road, you can help reduce the risk of such incidents in the future.",Dolphin-Mistral
4dtnx6,"Okay, wow, this is definitely a frustrating situation! You're absolutely not the asshole here. This woodworker is dodging the question of price, and frankly, it’s a really unprofessional approach. 

It sounds like they're trying to shift the blame onto you for not being “explicit,” but the initial conversation was vague. You clearly stated you wanted a price *before* committing, and they just gave you a placeholder number. 

Their response about “finished products being pricey” is a classic deflection. They’re trying to make you feel like you’re the one who messed up by not knowing what a custom piece of furniture costs. 

You’re right to feel like an idiot – it’s completely reasonable to expect a final price estimate when you’ve discussed your requirements. 

Honestly, you should probably just cut your losses and find a different woodworker. This one isn't communicating clearly and seems unwilling to provide a straightforward quote. Good luck!",Gemma3_4b
4dtnx6,"Hey there! It sounds like you've had a bit of an issue here with the woodworker. Let me break down your situation:

1. You contacted them in early March to discuss your specifications, and they quoted you a price of $60-$100 for the desktop. 
2. They asked if you wanted a gloss coat on the wood, which would add to the cost. 
3. When you followed up today to check on the progress, they informed you that the total cost would be around $300.
4. You felt misled by their initial price and argued that you should have been given an accurate estimate based on your specifications.

It's understandable that you feel frustrated by this situation - it can be difficult to navigate price negotiations, especially when dealing with custom work. However, I think there are a few factors to consider:

1. As the woodworker pointed out, the initial price of $60-$100 was for an unfinished piece of wood. The additional cost of sanding and glossing the wood would have likely added to the total price. 
2. Custom work often requires flexibility in pricing due to varying levels of work required and desired quality of the finished product. It's possible that the woodworker couldn't provide you with an accurate estimate until they assessed the amount of work needed to complete your project.
3. Communication is key in any professional relationship, especially when it comes to custom work. If you had been more explicit about your expectations for the finished product and the price range you were comfortable with, it's possible that this misunderstanding could have been avoided.

Ultimately, while you may feel that the woodworker should have been more forthcoming in their pricing, it's also important to recognize that they may not have been aware of the full extent of work required until they had started the project. In situations like these, clear and open communication is vital for both parties to ensure a positive outcome.

I hope this helps provide some insight into your situation!",Dolphin-Mistral
4dy1f9,"Okay, wow, that’s a really relatable frustration! It sounds like you’ve definitely noticed a shift, and honestly, it’s completely understandable why you’re not thrilled about it. That old system with the dedicated baggers was a lifesaver – seriously, it made a huge difference, especially with a big family. 

It’s smart of you to point out that other stores in the same chain still have the traditional setup. That really highlights how they're prioritizing efficiency over customer convenience. And yeah, the reduced number of baggers is a big part of the problem. 

It's great you've noticed how the lines are building up now. It’s totally valid to feel like you're stuck in a waiting game, especially when you’re just trying to get your groceries.  It’s frustrating to see a change that seems to be making things *less* efficient for the customer. 

Have you tried letting an employee know your feedback? Sometimes just voicing your opinion can make a difference, even if it’s just to say you appreciate the old system. 

Hang in there – it’s good to stand up for what you think is fair!",Gemma3_4b
4dy1f9,"I understand your frustration, but let me provide you with a different perspective on this situation. The grocery store has introduced these new checkout stands for several reasons. Firstly, it is more efficient as it reduces the need for multiple employees to handle the bagging process. This allows the store to save money and allocate resources elsewhere. 

Secondly, self-checkout systems have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and speed. By incorporating aspects of self-checkouts into regular checkout lanes, the grocery store is aiming to provide a more seamless shopping experience for customers who prefer this method. 

While I can empathize with your preference for having someone else bag your groceries, it seems that these new systems are here to stay. If you find that waiting in line is too long or the process is too cumbersome, you may consider trying a different store within their chain that still offers traditional checkout lanes. 

In conclusion, while this change might not be ideal for everyone, it's essential to adapt and find ways to make the best of the situation. The grocery store has introduced these new stands with good intentions - to improve efficiency and customer experience. So the next time you visit the store, try approaching the checkout stand with an open mind and see how it goes.",Dolphin-Mistral
4dyx18,"Okay, wow, this is a surprisingly awkward situation! Don’t worry, you’re definitely not the asshole here. It’s totally understandable to feel a little weird about the whole thing, especially with the birthday card and the money. 

Honestly, they were incredibly thoughtful – a birthday card *and* cash is a really generous gesture. You didn’t owe them an immediate, huge thank you for the money, especially when you’re in a tight spot with college applications. 

You don't need to bring it up again tomorrow. Just be your normal, friendly self. 

As for a thank you card – absolutely do it! A handwritten note saying how much you appreciate their kindness and generosity would be perfect. It shows you recognize their thoughtfulness. 

Seriously, relax! They clearly wanted to do something nice for you. You’re doing great work and they’re a lovely family. 😊",Gemma3_4b
4dyx18,"Hello! It seems like you had a great experience with the family, but you're a bit concerned about how to handle the situation involving your birthday gift. In these types of situations, it's always best to communicate openly and honestly. If you feel that the parents might have misunderstood your reaction to their gesture, you can address it during your next babysitting session.

You could say something like, ""I just wanted to thank you again for the birthday card and cash you gave me on my last visit. I really appreciated both the thoughtfulness of the card and the helpfulness of the cash. As a college student preparing for med school, every little bit helps."" This way, you're expressing your gratitude without making it seem like you were initially ungrateful or confused.

If you think they might still be wondering about why you didn't mention the card in front of them, just explain that you had never received such a gift before and felt it was more appropriate to open the card privately. The most important thing is to communicate your feelings and intentions openly with the family, as this will help maintain a healthy relationship moving forward.

You're absolutely not the asshole here. It’s valid to say you don't enjoy large, public gatherings, especially with family you don't connect with, and to express that clearly. It’s disappointing when people don’t listen, and it sounds like they missed a really simple opportunity to show you they value your feelings. 

It’s okay to feel annoyed and a little hurt. You can appreciate the gesture of a party, but that doesn’t erase the fact that they didn't respect your boundaries.

4e22v5,"Hi there! It sounds like you're not having the best experience with your birthday celebration tonight. While it's always nice to have family gatherings and celebrations, it can be challenging when they don't align with our preferences or personal comfort zones.

It's great that you shared your thoughts on what you would prefer for your birthday - a nice meal instead of the party at a pub. Your parents may not have fully understood how important it was to you and might not have realized that they were disregarding your wishes. Sometimes, our loved ones don't always know the best way to support us or show their love, so we need to communicate openly with them about what makes us happy.

Unfortunately, it seems like a misunderstanding occurred, and now you feel forced into attending a party that you weren't looking forward to. In these situations, it can be helpful to find the silver lining or focus on the positive aspects of the night. For example, you could try to enjoy conversations with family members that you may not have spoken to in a while or seek out activities within the pub that interest you, such as playing pool or board games with others attending the event.

Additionally, it's essential to express your feelings and thoughts to your parents. Let them know how their actions made you feel so they can better understand your perspective. This open communication will not only help them learn from this experience but also strengthen your relationship with them.

Remember that it's okay to have different preferences or ideas about what constitutes a great celebration.

However, you’re not the asshole here. This was completely sprung on you, arranged by your in-laws without your input. It’s frustrating when someone just *does* something without consulting you, especially when it’s a big, messy job! 

Making dinner and tea is definitely a thoughtful gesture, and it shows you were thinking of them. 

As for your FIL’s comments, they’re definitely not helpful and probably stemming from their own enjoyment of gardening. Don’t let them guilt you – you’re doing what you need to do with a little baby!

You mentioned you didn't know about the truck arriving and that you had a 7-month-old to look after. It is perfectly understandable that you could not leave her unattended while she was napping, especially considering the fact that you might have been covered in mud. It is also natural for new parents to prioritize their child's well-being and safety over other tasks or activities.

Regarding the passive-aggressive comments from your FIL, it seems like he may be unaware of your situation with the baby. You could gently explain to him that you appreciate his help but had to stay indoors because of your child. This way, he will have a better understanding of why you couldn't assist them outside.

I don't think you are being an asshole for not offering to help. It is crucial for you to prioritize the well-being of your child and ensuring that she receives the proper care and attention from her parents. Your FIL might have misconstrued your actions as laziness due to a lack of understanding or communication.

Instead of focusing on what *could* have been, focus on being present with your new girlfriend and establishing a solid connection *without* the baggage of your past.

Your decision to invite the new girl to the event where you knew your ex might be attending was a bit risky, but it's understandable given the circumstances. It showcases your emotional maturity in handling your relationships and managing expectations.

In situations like this, communication is key. Be open and honest with both of them about your feelings and intentions. This way, you can ensure that everyone involved is on the same page and understands where you stand in each relationship. 

If your ex feels threatened by your new relationship, it may be helpful to explain that while you care for her deeply, the connection you have with the new girl is genuine and important to you as well. This can help alleviate any fears she might have about you moving on too quickly or not valuing the friendship you have developed.

This has led to a tense situation, which is not ideal for anyone involved.

Given that your aunt's partner owns the house, his decision carries significant weight, and it seems that you need to find a way to coexist peacefully in this shared space. Here are some steps you could take:

1. Open communication: Try talking to both your aunt and her partner about your concerns. Explain how this change has impacted your living situation and express your desire for a more amicable solution. Be open to their perspective as well, and attempt to find common ground.

2. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries regarding the use of your living space. Discuss specific guidelines for when guests can stay in your flat, such as weekends only or setting a limit on how often it happens. This will help prevent further misunderstandings and ensure that you both are aware of each other's expectations.

3. Compromise: Be willing to compromise on this matter if possible. Consider the possibility of having guests stay in your living room during specific times or under certain conditions, such as being asked in advance and giving you notice. This can help create a sense of fairness and understanding between all parties involved.

4. Create a written agreement: If necessary, put together a written agreement that outlines the terms and expectations for both parties. This can be especially helpful if there are ongoing issues or disagreements in the future.

5. Seek mediation: If communication and compromise don't yield positive results, consider seeking the help of a neutral third party, such as a mediator or counselor, to help resolve the situation. They can provide an objective perspective and assist with finding a mutually acceptable solution.

Remember that it is essential to maintain open communication and a sense of respect for each other's needs and preferences in order to create a harmonious living environment.

1. You felt uncomfortable with the drunken behavior of the seniors in a family setting. It is understandable that you wanted them to tone down their volume since it made it difficult for you and your friends to have a conversation.

2. Your friends and Jed's mom found humor in the situation, perhaps because they are all young adults and see this type of behavior as part of the college experience. It seems like everyone else at the table may not have shared the same level of concern that you did about the noise levels.

3. You addressed the issue directly with the seniors, which shows that you care about creating a comfortable environment for yourself and your friends. This is an admirable quality and demonstrates good communication skills.

4. It's important to note that everyone has different preferences when it comes to noise levels in social settings. Some people might enjoy loud, boisterous conversations, while others prefer a more quiet, intimate atmosphere. By standing up for yourself and expressing your preference, you are asserting your boundaries and showing respect for your own needs as well as the needs of those around you.

You might also want to consider suggesting a compromise, like setting a goal of raising some of the extra funds yourself through small jobs or chores around the house.

Honestly, I’d try to politely explain the situation to GameStop – emphasize the consistent problems you’ve experienced. Maybe frame it as wanting a controller that consistently performs as expected. Don’t feel like you need to fabricate a “broken” state. 

And hey, knowing Microsoft is also sending out faulty controllers adds fuel to the fire. Good luck getting a decent controller – you deserve one!",Gemma3_4b
4ejeez,"It seems you've had an unfortunate experience with your Xbox One Elite Controller purchases from GameStop. While it's natural to expect a high-quality product for the $150 price tag, we all know that manufacturing and quality control issues can occur even in mass production. The good news is that you have the option to return or exchange the controller within 30 days, per GameStop's Return Policy.

It's understandable that you may feel like an ""asshole"" for constantly returning a product that technically still works, but there are several factors to consider:

1) The cost of purchasing a defective product: In your case, it seems like you're getting the same issues with both controllers. Returning and exchanging them is a way for you to get a functional and satisfying gaming experience without having to spend additional money on a new controller.

2) Quality assurance: By returning the controllers that don't meet your expectations, you're essentially helping GameStop identify potential issues with their products or suppliers. This feedback can lead to improvements in product quality for other customers.

3) Customer satisfaction: Ultimately, it is essential for businesses like GameStop to ensure customer satisfaction. If you were unhappy with the controllers you received, returning them gives the company an opportunity to provide a better product or offer alternative solutions that could satisfy your needs.

As for the concern about lying and saying the controller is broken, it's crucial to remember that your main objective should be finding a functional product that meets your expectations. In this case, the fact that you are experiencing similar issues with two different controllers suggests there may indeed be an issue with the manufacturing process or quality control.

In conclusion, while it can be frustrating to encounter defective products, remember that returning and exchanging them is a way for you to get a product that works best for your needs. It also helps companies like GameStop improve their offerings and ensure customer satisfaction. In this specific case, I don't think you should feel bad about your actions; instead, consider it as an opportunity to obtain the high-quality product you deserve at the price you paid.",Dolphin-Mistral
4ek19h,"Okay, wow, this is a really common feeling and it’s totally valid to be frustrated. Seriously, you're not an asshole for wanting more reciprocation – it’s a fundamental need in any close relationship! 

It sounds like you're putting in a *ton* of effort, and it’s completely understandable to feel a little depleted when that effort doesn't always feel returned. His point about him not doing much for himself is a really important one. It's possible he’s just overwhelmed with school and doesn’t realize the impact his lack of effort has on you.

However, it's also worth considering *how* you're communicating your needs. Instead of just feeling like you're constantly the giver, maybe try framing it as, “I really value feeling supported and appreciated, and I'd love to see us find some small ways to show that to each other.” 

College is tough, and busy schedules are a huge factor. Maybe you guys could schedule a short, dedicated time to talk about how you’re both feeling and what small things would make a difference. 

Ultimately, a healthy relationship is about balance. Good luck navigating this – it’s a great starting point for a really important conversation!",Gemma3_4b
4ek19h,"It sounds like you're experiencing the natural ebbs and flows in every relationship, especially during such busy times in your lives as college students. The key is finding a balance where both partners feel appreciated and supported while still maintaining personal boundaries.

While it can be difficult to feel like the giver in a relationship, remember that relationships are not always about giving or taking but rather understanding each other's needs and making compromises. Communication is essential for any healthy partnership, so try having an open conversation with your SO about how you both feel about the balance of effort and support.

It might be helpful to recognize that your SO might not have the same capacity for giving as you do due to their demanding major and other commitments. Instead of focusing on who does more, consider what each person brings to the relationship – whether it's planning surprises or providing emotional support when needed.

Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. Your SO might excel in academics but struggle with expressing their emotions, making them less likely to plan surprises or do things for you as often as you would like. It's essential not to compare your relationship to others or set unrealistic expectations based on societal norms.

Lastly, always remember that relationships are a two-way street. Both partners should strive to give and take equally in various aspects of their lives. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the current dynamics, don't hesitate to reach out for support from friends, family, or even a mental health professional if needed.

In conclusion, the best approach is to communicate openly with your SO about your feelings and expectations while acknowledging and respecting each other's differences. Remember that relationships are ever-evolving and require constant effort from both parties to maintain balance and happiness.",Dolphin-Mistral
4emtgf,"Okay, wow, this is a really frustrating situation! You’re absolutely not alone in feeling this way – it’s totally understandable why you're feeling like you’re being unfairly targeted. 

It sounds like Jane is really leaning into a dynamic where she’s taking on a disproportionate amount of responsibility, and honestly, it’s creating a really uneven living situation. You're right to point out that the overflowing sink and trash are major issues, and it’s valid for them to address those. 

However, the way they responded – specifically singling you out about the dishes – feels a bit unfair. It’s reasonable to expect everyone to contribute to keeping the space clean, and it’s okay to gently push back when you see others not pulling their weight. 

Maybe next time, instead of just explaining you were waiting for her, you could say something like, “Hey, it’s important we all keep the apartment clean. Could we talk about how we can share the responsibility of keeping the sink clear?” 

Don’t feel like you’re the bad guy here. You're not trying to start a fight, you're just trying to live in a reasonably clean space!",Gemma3_4b
4emtgf,"It seems like there is some disharmony in your shared living space, and it's understandable that you feel frustrated by the situation. Communication is key to resolving these issues, so kudos on discussing your concerns with Jane. It's unfortunate that she isn't shouldering her share of the household chores, but it sounds like you're trying to address this in a constructive manner.

You may want to consider establishing clear rules for shared responsibilities within the apartment. Sit down with all four roommates and agree on a schedule for tasks such as cooking, cleaning, taking out the trash, and doing the dishes. This way, everyone's duties are clearly defined, and it's easier to hold each other accountable.

Remember that not everyone has the same habits or mindset when it comes to maintaining a clean living space. Some people might be naturally tidier than others, while others may simply need more reminders. Try to approach this issue from a place of understanding and empathy. Instead of laying into Jane, ask her if there's something that's preventing her from taking care of the dishes or other chores. Perhaps she's feeling overwhelmed or stressed, which is affecting her ability to keep up with the cleaning.

In any case, maintaining a clean living space is essential for the well-being of all inhabitants, so it's crucial to come up with a plan that works for everyone. By working together and establishing clear expectations, you can create a more harmonious living situation for all involved.",Dolphin-Mistral
4esjme,"Okay, wow, that’s a really frustrating situation, and you’re absolutely not the asshole here. Seriously. It sounds like you were just trying to provide some factual information about a legal change, and you’ve been completely shut down with a really aggressive reaction. 

It’s understandable to feel hurt when someone responds like that, especially when it’s delivered so harshly. The fact that they’re resorting to insults and censorship just because you disagree is completely inappropriate. 

The flag code situation is a complex one, and it’s valid to point out the legal history of it. It’s not about *having* an opinion, it’s about sharing information. 

Honestly, this person’s response says far more about *them* than it does about you. Don’t let their reaction derail you. You did nothing wrong by offering information.  

Maybe just step away from the conversation for a bit and focus on the fact that you were treated disrespectfully.  Hang in there!",Gemma3_4b
4esjme,"It seems like you and your cousin had a disagreement over an interpretation of the flag code and its constitutionality. It's unfortunate that this difference in opinion led to the unfriending, but it's important to remember that each person has their own beliefs and perspectives.

In today's digital age, it's quite common for people to connect with others who share similar opinions or beliefs, so it isn't surprising that your cousin might have felt uncomfortable having you on their friend list due to the disagreement. It's essential to respect each other's opinions and not force our own perspectives onto others.

On the flip side, blocking someone because of a differing opinion can be counterproductive and limit healthy discussions and debates that help us grow as individuals and develop new ideas. While it may have been uncomfortable for your cousin at first, a more constructive approach would have been to discuss the matter openly or privately, rather than censor you entirely.

As for whether you're an asshole or not, I wouldn't say that you are. You didn't force your opinion onto anyone else, and you even gave a factual correction about the flag code amendment without expressing any judgment or opinion. It's unfortunate that this disagreement led to the unfriending, but remember that everyone has their own boundaries and comfort levels in social interactions.

In future conversations, it might be helpful to consider the other person's feelings and potential sensitivity towards certain topics. Sometimes, having an open dialogue and showing empathy can help bridge differences and foster understanding between individuals who hold differing opinions.",Dolphin-Mistral

Honestly, you're *not* an asshole here. It's completely valid to feel hurt when someone breaks a clear request, especially one delivered with “please.” His reaction – minimizing it and then spreading it around – makes it even worse. 

It sounds like he’s avoiding taking responsibility for his actions and just trying to deflect. It’s understandable you want to cut ties, especially if he’s consistently dismissive. 

You don’t *need* to apologize for feeling hurt. You could consider a brief, neutral response like, ""I was disappointed that the confidence wasn't respected,"" but you don't owe him a lengthy explanation. 

Focus on protecting your own boundaries. If the others are starting to think you're an ""asshole,"" that's on *them* for not understanding the situation. Seriously consider distancing yourself from this group – it sounds like they're not prioritizing your feelings.

4euapy,"It sounds like you were really hoping your friend would keep his promise not to show or talk about the video. When he broke that trust, it understandably hurt your feelings. It seems like there was a lot of confusion and miscommunication surrounding this issue. Instead of apologizing or trying to smooth things over with everyone else, it might be more effective to sit down and have an honest conversation with your friend about how you feel.

This way, he will understand the severity of what he did, and you can discuss how to mend the relationship going forward. It's also essential to let him know that trust is a crucial part of any friendship, so breaking it can be quite damaging.

If your friend isn't taking this situation seriously enough, then it might indeed be time to reevaluate the relationship and think about whether or not he is a toxic friend. Sometimes, friends may grow apart due to differing values, interests, or simply because they grow in different directions. In these cases, it might be better for both of you to move on and find new friends who align better with your personality and values.

Remember that being able to trust someone is a key component of any healthy relationship, including friendships. Trust takes time to build, but it can also be broken in an instant, so it's essential to make sure that your future interactions are based on mutual respect, understanding, and honesty.",Dolphin-Mistral
4eun00,"Wow, that's a really tough story, and you handled a really difficult situation with incredible courage. It’s completely understandable why you felt so strongly about it – seeing someone you cared about so deeply struggling, and suspecting something serious was going on, is heartbreaking. 

It sounds like you did everything you could to help, and it’s awful that she reacted so negatively. It's really common for people in those situations to deny or minimize abuse, which makes it even harder. You were right to trust your instincts and seek help – that was a huge step. 

It's frustrating that she didn’t get to fully explore the possibility of abuse, and it’s okay to feel disappointed about that. 

And then, on top of everything, to hear she moved on so quickly... yeah, that just adds another layer of pain. 

You did the right thing by speaking up, and honestly, you should be proud of yourself for taking such a brave step. It's okay to still feel the sting of it all.  

Would you be open to talking more about how you’re feeling about it now?",Gemma3_4b

It's commendable that you noticed the signs of potential abuse and took steps to try and get help, even though it was uncomfortable for you. 

Given that she got upset with you for telling someone about her situation, it's possible that there may have been some truth in your concerns, or at least a complex set of dynamics within her family that made her reluctant to share the details. You should remember that her reaction to your intervention was likely fueled by fear, shame, and a desire to protect herself and her family from potential consequences.

Breaking up with her may have been necessary given the circumstances, as it was clear that her well-being was at stake. It's understandable that you might feel upset or even guilty about her getting together with someone new so quickly after your breakup, but remember that this is part of her process in finding closure and moving forward from a difficult situation.

It's totally valid to feel protective of something you've poured time and passion into, especially when someone else is just casually making fun of it. You invested in Gabon, the kufi, and the ""bou-bou"" – that’s awesome! It's completely understandable that you felt a little stung when he wasn’t appreciating the effort and connection you had built. 

His reaction, especially wanting to wear it during a tournament, felt a little dismissive. It’s not about the hat itself, but about the lack of respect for your enthusiasm. 

You were right to set a boundary – you don't have to tolerate someone reducing something you care about to a joke. It’s okay to say, ""Hey, I'm really invested in this, and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t make fun of it."" 

Don’t beat yourself up about it! It sounds like you handled it pretty well.",Gemma3_4b
4euwkq,"You're not an asshole for feeling upset about your friend poking fun at something you were genuinely interested in. Passion can be a powerful thing, and when people invest time and energy into learning about different cultures or countries, it's natural to feel a sense of pride and attachment to those things. In this case, the hat from Gabon represents more than just an accessory - it symbolizes your personal journey of discovery and growth.

It seems that Wes's behavior was more of a reflection of his own lack of sensitivity and empathy rather than any direct malice toward you or your interests. While some people might find humor in making light of other cultures, it's important to remember that these cultures are real and meaningful to those who have invested time and energy into them.

In the future, consider having a conversation with Wes about the importance of respecting and appreciating different cultures, especially if he knows you are passionate about Gabon. You can explain to him how his humor may come off as insensitive or disrespectful, and help him understand why it's essential to be mindful of others' feelings in these situations.

You could start by talking with friend number 1 about how his girlfriend has made some people feel uncomfortable during your hangouts. It's possible that she is not aware of her actions or their impact on others.

Additionally, consider involving friend number 1 in the decision-making process regarding whether to continue spending time together with his girlfriend present. By including him in the discussion, you can ensure that everyone's feelings and opinions are considered and respected.

If after discussing these issues, it becomes clear that hanging out with her isn't working for everyone, it may be best to communicate this to friend number 1 and explain that while he is a valued friend, his girlfriend's behavior has made some group members uncomfortable, leading to the decision not to include her in future gatherings.

While exposing Dylan and Henry's behavior is important in teaching them a lesson and holding them accountable for their actions, there are other ways you could have handled the situation that may have resulted in similar outcomes without creating further distress or harm.

Instead of using an anonymous Twitter account to share the video, you could have contacted local authorities or animal welfare organizations directly to report the incident.

It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your boyfriend about your sleeping situation. He may not be aware of how his actions are affecting you or that he is waking you up frequently. By discussing this issue together, you can find a solution that works for both of you. For instance, you could suggest using earplugs or white noise machines to minimize the sound from his movements. Alternatively, you might ask him if it's possible for him to sleep on the other side of the bed or in his own bed.

Remember, communication is key in maintaining a healthy relationship and ensuring that both partners' needs are being met. If he truly cares about your well-being, I believe he will be open to finding a solution that works for both of you. Good luck!",Dolphin-Mistral
4fdt2c,"Okay, wow, this is a tricky situation and it’s totally understandable why you’re feeling a bit lost. Let’s break this down. You’re not necessarily an *asshole*, but you definitely made a misstep by not being upfront about the other girl. 

It’s completely valid to feel weird about hooking up with someone when you’re juggling another relationship, even if it’s not exclusive. That’s a lot to navigate. However, she’s right to feel hurt and misled. Honesty is *always* the best policy, and keeping that other relationship a secret created a false impression. 

She’s understandably upset because she felt like she was being used, and that’s a valid reaction. You could have handled it better by acknowledging that you hadn't been transparent and apologizing for the confusion. 

Moving forward, a sincere apology and explaining your hesitation would have gone a long way. Now, she's understandably hurt, and rebuilding that trust will take time and genuine effort. Don’t try to minimize her feelings - validate them and let her know you understand why she’s upset. 

Ultimately, this is a good learning experience about communication in relationships.  Do you want to talk about how to handle similar situations in the future?",Gemma3_4b
4fdt2c,"It seems like you're facing a tough situation here and are trying to navigate the complexity of interpersonal relationships in college. It is understandable that you may have felt conflicted about your decision to hook up with this girl, given your quasi-relationship with another girl. However, it is essential to be honest and transparent in all situations, especially when dealing with the emotions of others.

It's crucial to recognize that honesty is paramount in forming healthy relationships, whether they are romantic or platonic. By not disclosing your situation with the other girl, you created an environment of deceit, which ultimately led to this upsetting situation. While it may be uncomfortable to discuss your personal life openly, it's essential to prioritize honesty and clear communication.

It is never easy to admit our mistakes or apologize for the consequences of our actions, but in this case, an apology might be the first step towards resolving this issue with your acquaintance. Explain your side of the story, express remorse for not being upfront about your relationship status, and offer a genuine apology for any emotional distress you may have caused her.

Moving forward, it's essential to learn from this experience and strive to be more open and honest in all aspects of your life. By doing so, you will create a stronger foundation for healthy relationships and a better understanding of the emotions and expectations involved.",Dolphin-Mistral
4fheqa,"Okay, wow, this is a really complicated situation and honestly, you’re not the asshole here. Let’s break it down. John has repeatedly disregarded your boundaries – he’s been persistent with flirting and kissing when you’ve clearly stated you’re not interested. That’s not okay, and your reaction was completely understandable.

Punching him in the face was definitely a dramatic response, and maybe you could have handled it differently, but he escalated the situation by continuing to pursue you despite your clear rejection. 

It sounds like he’s consistently testing the limits, and your reaction was a desperate attempt to stop him. Six months with Matthew and him being so close with John makes this even more frustrating. 

You don’t owe him an apology – you were protecting yourself.  It’s completely valid to react defensively when someone keeps pushing your boundaries. 

Moving forward, it sounds like you need to establish very firm boundaries with John and possibly limit your interactions with him.  It’s good you’ve already distanced yourself.  Focus on enjoying your relationship with Matthew and don't let John’s behavior derail things.  You did what you needed to do to protect yourself.",Gemma3_4b
4fheqa,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation with your friend John, and it can be really hard to know how to handle someone who repeatedly disrespects your boundaries and makes you feel uncomfortable. It's clear that words haven't been enough to get through to him, but physical actions can sometimes send a stronger message.

Your reaction last night was certainly an intense one, but considering the repeated unwanted advances from John, it's understandable why you acted the way you did. While there may have been better ways to handle the situation in that moment, given the circumstances and the fact that words haven't worked in the past, it's not unreasonable for you to feel like you were pushed to your limit.

As for whether or not you should apologize, that's a tricky question. On one hand, you might want to show remorse for hurting John physically and acknowledge that you can see how your actions could be perceived as excessive. However, at the same time, you may feel justified in your actions given the history between you and John. 

Ultimately, it's up to you whether or not you think an apology is necessary. If you do decide to apologize, I would suggest making sure that it comes from a genuine place of understanding that your reaction was disproportionate and unacceptable behavior. It might also be helpful to communicate to John that he needs to respect others' boundaries and understand that these types of actions are not okay.

It seems like you have a good support system with Matthew and the rest of your friends, so it might be worth talking to them about how you can move forward in this situation. They could provide additional perspective or even help mediate a conversation between you and John if you both feel comfortable doing so.",Dolphin-Mistral
4frdhl,"Okay, wow, this is a really frustrating situation! It totally makes sense why you're feeling so conflicted – you’re right, he’s definitely escalating things over seemingly small stuff. 

It sounds like you're dealing with someone who has a really reactive sense of insecurity, and honestly, the white lie probably just fueled that. It’s smart that you were trying to protect the group dynamic, but it clearly backfired. 

You’re not an asshole for wanting to protect yourself and your friends. It’s completely valid to distance yourself when someone’s consistently being hostile and demanding. 

As for what to do – I agree with you, leaning into distance is probably the healthiest route right now. Trying to constantly reason with someone who's already upset isn't going to work. 

However, maybe a *brief* and neutral conversation could be useful. Something like, ""Billy, I value our friendship, but I need to be honest – when I say something isn’t possible, it means it. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, but I need to be clear.” 

But seriously, prioritize your own peace of mind. Don't feel pressured to be his therapist. 

It's also good you recognize your other friends are acting similarly – that might suggest this is a pattern in him. 

Ultimately, you’re not responsible for his reactions. You're doing what you need to do to maintain a healthy friendship (or lack thereof). ❤️",Gemma3_4b
4frdhl,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation with your friend Billy. It's clear that his behavior can be both confusing and frustrating, especially when it seems unprovoked. First off, let me say that no one is entirely at fault here; it's important to understand everyone's perspective in this situation.

In terms of the group chat incident, it might have been helpful to explain to Billy why he wasn't included without outright lying about there not being a chat. He may have felt left out and that could have contributed to his hostile reaction. It's also essential to take into account your mom's dislike for Billy; while you shouldn't let her opinions dictate your friendships, it could be worth discussing this with her to gain more insight.

As for how to handle the situation going forward, I suggest attempting to communicate openly and honestly with Billy. Express that his behavior is upsetting and damaging to your friendship. Let him know that you're willing to work things out if he's open to discussing the issue and making amends. If this doesn't yield positive results, then perhaps it's best to distance yourself for a while and focus on other friendships.

Remember to always prioritize your own well-being and mental health. It might be helpful to confide in someone else about your struggles with Billy or seek advice from a trusted adult. In the end, you should never feel guilty for standing up for yourself and maintaining healthy boundaries in any of your relationships.",Dolphin-Mistral
4fw56d,"Okay, wow, that’s a seriously tough situation you’re dealing with – and it sounds like you’re understandably overwhelmed. It’s completely understandable why you reacted the way you did, seeing him with that pipe was terrifying, and your response was a natural instinct. 

First off, let’s talk about the meth – that’s a huge red flag and a really serious situation. It’s great you recognized it and wanted to distance yourself. 

Now, about the computer lab incident... that’s a really complicated mess. The spitting definitely escalated things, and your reaction of punching him is understandable given the context. However, the school is going to see it as assault, and that’s why you’re facing a suspension. 

The suspension is a consequence of *your* actions, even if you felt justified. It’s important to remember that while your feelings are valid, the school's perspective is focused on maintaining order and safety. 

Regarding the future, you’ll likely need to meet with the school administration to discuss this further. Focus on acknowledging your part in the escalation, and express your concern for your friend. 

It’s a lot to handle, and it’s okay to feel stressed. Do you want to talk about how you’re feeling, or maybe explore some resources for dealing with difficult friendships and substance abuse?",Gemma3_4b

When it comes to dealing with friends who have developed unhealthy habits or behaviors, it can be challenging to know how to handle the situation without causing further harm. It might help to talk to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, about your concerns and seek their advice on how to approach this issue.

As for your suspension from school, while spitting may not be an ideal way to resolve conflicts, it's essential to understand that physical violence is never the answer. Physical altercations can lead to serious consequences, like suspensions or even expulsion, and could put both you and the other person at risk of harm. It's crucial to find alternative ways to express your feelings and handle conflict without resorting to violence.

I would suggest trying to focus on managing your emotions in a healthier way, such as through journaling, exercise, or talking with friends and family members about what you're going through. Additionally, it might be helpful to consider joining support groups or seeking professional help if you feel like you need additional guidance or assistance.

It’s totally understandable why you’re feeling a bit puzzled – that interaction with L outside was seriously strange. It’s great you recognized that vibe and it definitely seems like she was trying to create some distance. 

The makeup-fixing-her-face thing with you in the bathroom is just…weird. And the “tell her to fuck off” comment? That’s a bit much, even if she was feeling frustrated. It definitely doesn’t sound like a typical friendly interaction. 

Honestly, the surprise proposal on Leap Day is a little icing on the cake of a strange night! It’s good that you went with it, but it's also okay to acknowledge how odd everything felt. 

It sounds like you’re dealing with some potentially tricky dynamics within her friend group. Maybe it’s worth gently asking your girlfriend how she’s feeling about L’s behavior – just to see if she’s picking up on anything too. Don't sweat the Subway weirdness too much, though! 

Ultimately, focus on enjoying your time with your girlfriend. Let her know you’re there for her, and hopefully, things will feel a bit clearer moving forward.",Gemma3_4b
4fxthw,"It seems like you've had quite an interesting experience with your girlfriend and her friends, especially regarding the behavior of her best friend, L. It's always challenging to navigate social situations, especially when there are emotions and potential misunderstandings involved.

Firstly, it's essential to try and maintain open communication with both your girlfriend and L in order to understand their perspectives and feelings better. You can initiate this by expressing your thoughts and concerns without blaming or accusing anyone, but instead, focusing on how you felt during the various interactions. This will help create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their emotions and working towards resolving any issues.

Secondly, try to be more inclusive of L when you're together with her friends in the future. Offering her a chance to participate in conversations and activities can help establish trust and understanding between all parties involved. Remember that everyone has different comfort levels in social situations; giving L some space initially might also be helpful.

Lastly, it's crucial to prioritize your relationship with your girlfriend. Make sure you communicate your feelings openly and honestly, allowing her to understand how her behavior and the actions of her friends impact you. Work together to create a plan that ensures everyone's needs are addressed and can coexist harmoniously.

What you’re describing sounds like a classic case of someone who’s comfortable with a low-effort approach, and it’s creating a huge problem for you and your future. The fact that he’s smart and charismatic makes it even harder because he likely *knows* he has that ability, but isn’t using it to build something stable.

Instead of just repeating yourself, maybe try framing the conversation differently. Instead of focusing on the “retirement” and “planning” aspects, which probably feel like nagging, try talking about *his* feelings and how *he* feels about the job. Something like, “I notice you get so excited at the beginning of a new job, but it seems to wear you down quickly. Can we talk about what’s making you feel that way, and how we can make sure you’re feeling supported?” 

It's also worth considering *why* he jumps ship so easily. Is he afraid of failure? Does he crave novelty? Understanding the root cause might help you both find a solution. 

You’re not wrong to want stability, and you’re completely valid in feeling stressed. Don't feel guilty for wanting a partner who can contribute to your long-term goals.

Your concerns about job stability, retirement planning, and the need to make important decisions about education and career growth for yourself are all valid and understandable.

Firstly, it's essential that you both approach this situation with open communication and understanding, as well as a willingness to compromise and find solutions that work for both of you. It may be helpful to set up regular meetings or check-ins where you can discuss the progress he is making in his job search, as well as any challenges or concerns that arise along the way.

You mentioned your husband's tendency to get excited at the beginning of a new job and then lose motivation after some time has passed. To address this issue, encourage him to find ways to maintain his enthusiasm for his work while also ensuring he takes adequate breaks and time off to recharge his energy levels. This might involve discussing his career goals with his current employer or seeking out additional training opportunities that could help keep him engaged in his role.

It's also crucial to consider the possibility of seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling. A trained therapist can provide guidance and support to both of you, helping you work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your husband's job-hopping behavior and assisting you in finding healthy ways to cope with stress.

Lastly, it might be helpful for the two of you to develop a long-term financial plan, ensuring that you both have clear goals and strategies in place to secure your future together. This could involve setting up an emergency fund or exploring alternative income streams if necessary.

It’s completely reasonable to expect someone living in a shared space, especially one that’s a significant portion of your income, to contribute to the rent. The fact that he's getting mail delivered too just reinforces that he’s practically a resident. 

It’s understandable the others feel defensive – they’re used to things being simple. But you guys are right to push back. 

Honestly, the boyfriend’s reaction seems a little dramatic, and the flatmate’s upset feelings are probably stemming from feeling like they’re being treated unfairly. 

You need to calmly reiterate your position – you’re not trying to be difficult, just fair. Maybe suggest a small monthly contribution to the rent, or a set amount for utilities, to show you’re willing to compromise, but don't back down on the core issue of him contributing to the overall cost of living in the flat. 

Good luck – this is a classic roommate dilemma!",Gemma3_4b
4g1kro,"It sounds like there are some conflicting opinions on this issue, which is understandable given the circumstances. The three of you originally agreed to pay equal rent amounts without considering that one person would be staying in the house so frequently. It's natural that your feelings have changed as you've all gotten more comfortable with each other and his presence has become more regular.

However, I can understand why your flatmate and her boyfriend are hesitant to agree with your proposal. They might feel like they have already contributed in their own way by paying bills for the shared resources they use, such as electricity and internet. It's also important to acknowledge that it is not uncommon for couples to spend a lot of time together when they first start dating or when one person has moved away from their parents' home.

What I would suggest is to approach this issue with more open communication and understanding. Try having another conversation with your flatmate and her boyfriend, listening to their concerns and explaining yours in a calm manner. Perhaps you could propose that he pays a small portion of the rent, not an equal five split but enough so that it feels fair to everyone involved.

You may also want to consider other possible solutions, such as:
1) Talking to your landlord about adding him to the tenancy agreement if that is allowed.
2) Suggesting a compromise where he contributes a certain amount of money each month towards rent and bills based on how often he stays over.
3) Discussing with your flatmate the idea of her boyfriend having his own key so that it would be easier for him to come and go as needed without making you feel like he is living there all the time.

While your intention was most likely just lighthearted teasing, it's essential to recognize that sometimes our jokes can be misinterpreted or make others feel uncomfortable. In this case, it seems like your joke came across as if you were complaining about the music volume. 

It could be helpful to consider how your actions might affect those around you and whether they may have different interpretations of your intentions. It's also important to communicate clearly with your friends in such situations to avoid misunderstandings or causing unnecessary stress for the people around you.

In conclusion, while I don't believe you were intentionally trying to be disruptive, it can be helpful to consider how others might perceive your actions and take steps to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.

It's not unusual for friendships to evolve as people grow and experience new things. The key is to recognize this change and adapt accordingly. Although it might be difficult at first, try to focus on creating positive interactions with other friends in your group and finding activities that everyone enjoys.

Remember that every person has their own unique journey, and sometimes, friendships have natural expiration dates. As you continue through high school, keep an open mind and be willing to make new friends and embrace change as it comes. It's important not to hold onto past friendships that may no longer serve a purpose in your life.

Lastly, if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to about any concerns or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to family members, teachers, or even professional counselors for support and guidance.

Your grandmother might appreciate the honesty about the ingredients if she eventually discovers that you have been using black pepper without telling her. This will help build trust between the two of you and avoid any misunderstandings or negative feelings in the future.

If you're worried about her reaction, consider having a conversation with her about your cooking preferences and why you choose to use specific ingredients like black pepper. You can discuss its benefits and how it enhances the flavors in your dishes without compromising her health. If she is open to trying new things or learning more about cooking, this could be an opportunity for you both to bond over a shared interest.

First off, it is understandable that your boss needs time away to take care of his family emergency. However, it's also reasonable for you and your coworkers to have concerns about the project's progression and your own financial stability. Here are a few steps you can take to address these issues:

1. Maintain open communication with your boss: Although he may be avoiding direct contact through phone calls or text messages, try reaching out via email. Provide updates on the progress of your projects, any challenges you're facing, and any questions or concerns you have about future work assignments or payments. This will show that you are proactive in managing the project while also demonstrating your professionalism and dedication to the cause.

2. Collaborate with your coworkers: Work together as a team to discuss possible solutions for handling the absence of your boss. Brainstorm ideas on how to keep the project moving forward, and establish clear communication channels among yourselves so that everyone is aware of the current status of the work. This unity will help maintain morale and productivity during this challenging time.

3. Stay patient and empathetic: It's crucial to remember that your boss is dealing with a personal emergency, which can be incredibly difficult. While it's essential to address your concerns, try to extend understanding and compassion towards his situation. Your patience and support may help alleviate some of the pressure he is facing during this challenging time.

4. Reach out to other stakeholders: If you still have unanswered questions or concerns about the project's future, don't hesitate to involve your boss's business partner. They may be able to provide valuable insights and guidance on how best to manage the situation while your boss is away. Additionally, they could potentially assist in arranging a meeting or video call to discuss any outstanding issues.

5. Keep a positive attitude: While it can be frustrating when faced with uncertainty and lack of communication from your supervisor, maintaining a positive outlook will make it easier for you and your coworkers to stay focused and motivated. Remember that this is a temporary situation, and eventually, your boss should return with an update on the project and financial matters.

I think it would be helpful if everyone could clarify their roles and responsibilities when it comes to taking care of the dog.

For example, is there a specific schedule that everyone should follow? If so, make sure everyone is aware of this schedule and holds themselves accountable for adhering to it. This way, you can ensure that the dog's waste is managed effectively and no one has to pick up after him when they're not supposed to be taking care of him.

Additionally, try to communicate with each other more openly and directly. It seems like there is some frustration and misunderstanding in this conversation, which could be resolved through better communication. If someone does something that violates the schedule or expectations, address it calmly and constructively instead of getting angry or blaming others. This will help everyone feel more responsible for their actions and understand what they need to do to maintain a clean, comfortable living space for all of you.

Ultimately, it's essential to find a balance between your individual responsibilities and the needs of the family as a whole. By working together and clearly communicating expectations and roles, you can create a more harmonious living situation where everyone feels valued and supported.",Dolphin-Mistral

Seriously, it takes a lot of courage to admit that feeling, and it’s completely valid to feel this way when you’re dealing with a situation like this. It’s absolutely understandable that seeing her with someone else would feel like a constant, sharp reminder of what you’re missing.

You’re not an asshole for wanting to avoid them – at least, not for wanting to protect yourself. It’s a completely reasonable reaction to intense heartbreak. The question is, how do you navigate this in a way that’s *healthy* for you?

Avoiding them forever might feel good in the short term, but it could also lead to resentment and isolation down the line. Maybe a temporary distance is okay, but consider if there’s a way to eventually reconnect – even just acknowledging their happiness without it hurting you so deeply. 

Focus on building your own happiness and support system.  Would talking to a therapist help you process these feelings and develop coping strategies? There are a lot of resources out there to help you through this. You deserve to feel better, and taking care of yourself is key. Sending you strength!",Gemma3_4b
4ghpcw,"I understand that it can be incredibly painful and difficult to witness the happiness of others when you're struggling with unrequited feelings or loneliness, but avoiding your friends entirely would only make things worse in the long run.

Firstly, remember that life is about change and growth. It's natural for friendships to evolve over time, and it's essential to allow room for these changes without letting them define your entire relationship. Your friendships are likely more resilient than you think, and they can adapt to the shifting dynamics of your lives.

Secondly, try to practice self-compassion. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of a potential relationship, but also recognize that everyone deserves happiness, even if it's not with you. Comparing your life to others is never helpful, as we all have unique journeys and experiences. Focus on cultivating positivity in your own life by exploring new hobbies, interests, or social circles.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help if you find that your emotions are interfering with your daily life or relationships. A therapist can provide valuable support and guidance as you navigate these complex feelings.

While it might be challenging to bear witness to the happiness of others, remember that you are not alone in this struggle. With time, understanding, and a little bit of resilience, you can learn to appreciate your friendships without longing for what could have been.",Dolphin-Mistral
